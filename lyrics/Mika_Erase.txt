I shouldn't have called so late last night
All insecure, out of my mind
I shouldn't have left that message on your phone
I shouldn't have said the things I said
Looking for love we left for dead
In a grave without a stone

As soon as you hear my voice
Don't hesitate, put your finger on the button

Erase my love
I bet you can't erase my touch
You're trying to replace a feeling without a name
With somebody else's face
In your head

Everything's cool, your rent is paid
The house is clean, your bed is made
But it's a ghost town in your mind
You never had time to go to sleep
We'd wake up tangled in the sheets
On a bed that we called home

When the pain won't go away
You might as well put your finger on the trigger

Erase my love
I bet you can't erase my touch
You're trying to replace a feeling without a name
With somebody else's face
In your head
Erase

Erase my love
I bet you can't erase my touch
'Cause you're trying to replace a feeling without a name
With somebody else's face
In your head
Erase
Erase
You're trying to replace a feeling without a name
With somebody else's face
In your head
Erase, oh
