I've been waiting for you
No, please, don't say anything (Hoo, ooh, yoo, ooh)
There's something I want to say to you (Hoo, ooh, yoo, ooh)
Remember
When I said someday we'd be together? (Hoo, ooh)
Well, someday is tonight (Ooh, hoo, ooh)

Here we are, just you and me
Got something for you, baby, wait and see
No need to worry, come follow me
I don't want you to think about anything else tonight
We've been together for quite sometime
Now I know that your love is mine
No more fantasizing of how it would be
'Cause tonight, all your dreams come true, oh

(Ready to give all my love)
(Won't hold back, someday is tonight) Ooh, huh, mmm
(Let me make your dreams come true)
(Don't hold back, someday is tonight) Ooh, huh
Mmm, oh

You know I promised I'd be worth the wait
Now the wait is over, baby, please don't hesitate
Boy, you make me tremble with your warm caress
I never knew I could feel this way, mmm
No more fantasizing, you'll ever have to do
'Cause tonight, baby, all your dreams come true
Ooh, I want you so bad, I can taste it, mmm (Ooh, ooh, huh, ooh)
I'm yours, if you want me

(Ready to give all my love) Ready to give it
(Won't hold back, someday is tonight) Ooh, ooh, mmm
(Let me make your dreams come true) Dreams come true
(Don't hold back, someday is tonight) Ooh, no, baby, no more, baby
(Ready to give all my love) Ooh, hoo
(Won't hold back, someday is tonight) Someday is tonight
(Let me make your dreams come true) Let me make
(Don't hold back, someday is tonight) Let me make, let me make your dreams come true, ooh
Right now
Oh
