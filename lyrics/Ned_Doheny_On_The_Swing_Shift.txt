I'm workin' on the swing shift
I'm movin' with the groove tonight
I'm workin' on the swing shift
I'm destined for the early bright
I can see
That my prospects are good
The ladies treat you different
Down on the swing shift
(Down on the swing shift)
The mystery is understood
There's always something shaking
See history in the making, yeah
You'll never scratch the surface
'Til you take the plunge
And meet me on the swing shift
(Meet me on the swing shift)
I'm burnin' with the will to thrill
Just meet me on the swing shift
(Meet me on the swing shift)
We'll pass 'em like they're standing still
I can tell
You been misunderstood
(You been misunderstood)
It's time you found the pocket
Down on the swing shift
(Down on the swing shift)
The change is bound to do you good
There's always something shaking
(Always something shaking)
Forget your heart is aching, yeah
(Forget your heart is aching)
You'll never know for certain
'Til you take the plunge
Down on the swing shift
(Down on the swing shift)
Down on the swing shift
(Down on the swing shift)
Down on the swing shift
(Down on the swing shift)
Down on the swing shift
(Down on the swing shift)
(Down on the swing shift)
Hey, hey, hey
I'm workin'
(Hey, I'm workin')
Whoa, I'm workin'
Down on the swing shift
(Down on the swing shift)
Hey, hey, hey

(Hey, I'm workin')
Whoa, I'm workin'
Down on the swing shift
(Down on the swing shift)
Whoa, whoa, whoa

Whoa, I'm workin'
Down on the swing shift
(Down on the swing shift)
