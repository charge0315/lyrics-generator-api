Come in baby
Who did you fool tonight?
Was it my friend John?
He thinks you're outasite
I know that you’ve been ballin'
You're as high as you can be
But I knew, baby, you’d come home to Willie Tee
She was just teasin' you
What did he say when you told him you were goin' home?
I know he wanted to handle you
I could tell by the bruises on your arm
I told him once he was a shuck time stud
If he tries this again
He's gotta shed some blood
It's gonna be all right
Now I don't blame you baby
For tryin' to swell his head
Cause after all baby
He's givin’ us his bread
Now it’s all right for you to go out all night long
But when hе spreads that bread
Be surе he spreads it right
I wanna thank you John
For being a good time come
You done proved yourself to me
You're as jive as you can be
Now it’s all right to keep her out all night
But when she leaves you alone
Send your paycheck home
It's gonna be all right
Oh thank you John
You been a boss time come
You ain't nothin' but a jive
Shuck time monkey town stud
It’s gonna be all right
You lollypop, you sucker John
