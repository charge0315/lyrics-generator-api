弥生の空は (Yayoi no sora wa)
見渡すかぎり… (miwatasu kagiri…)

In a time, in a place
In a world they forgot
Lives the heart of me
A part that just won't die
Just a boy, not a man
Sent to war in a land
They said we'd fight for their freedom
But I felt like a hired hand

Sometimes I have to find my way
Sometimes I have to get away

Take me back to Tokyo Road
Take me back to Tokyo Road

Working hard, for a pass
Got the night, make it last
It was a night to remember
All my life, I would never forget
In a bar, breathing smoke
Snorting whiskey, drinking coke
It was a time when no one would die
And there wasn't a care

Sometimes I wish it was that way
'Cause sometimes I have to get away

Take me back to Tokyo Road
Take me back to Tokyo Road
Take me back to Tokyo Road
Take me back to Tokyo Road, oh yeah

This guy turns me around, and he's pointing up the stairs
I found myself in her doorway, but there wasn't anybody there
She walked in the room with nothing on but a red light, aw-huh
And with a smile she got so close to me, she whispered something 'bout midnight
I didn't understand a word she said, but it felt so good
She knew that I didn't have any money, but baby I knew she would

Take me back to Tokyo Road
Take me back to Tokyo Road
Take me back to Tokyo Road
Take me back to Tokyo Road
Take me back to Tokyo Road
Take me back to Tokyo Road
Take me back to Tokyo Road
