You've lost a very good man, hey
Think it over, baby
Is it what you want to do oh, do oh?
Think it over before you leave me
Hey babe, I've been goon to you
Say that your packing you bags
Say that you've guided love
And you're sick and tires, girl of all my stuff
Say you gonna leave me, well baby
You're gonna tell me you're sorry
But you didn't understand
You've lost a very good man, hey
Think it over, baby
Is it what you want to do oh, do oh?
Think it over before you leave me
Haven't I been good to you
I'm gonna cry when you're leaving
Hey, I guess I'll do the best I can
You've lost a very good man, hey
Think it over, baby
Is it what you want to do oh, do oh?
Think it over before you leave me
Haven't I been good to you
You're gonna tell me you're sorry
But you didn't understand
You've lost a very good man, hey
Think it over, baby
Is it what you want to do oh, do oh?
Think it over before you leave me
Who can kiss you like I do, girl?
Just to tell me that you're sorry, I know it, baby
That you didn't understand, oh baby
You've lost a very good man, hey
Think it over, baby
Is it what you want to do oh, do oh?
Think it over before you leave me
Who can love you like I do, oh?
I'm gonna cry when you're leaving, you know it, girl
But I got to do the best I can, oh baby
You've lost a very good man
Think it over, baby
Is it what you wanna do oh, do oh?
