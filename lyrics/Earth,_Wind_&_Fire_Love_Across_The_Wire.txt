Girl, I wonder where you are
So I close my eyes and dream
About you, baby
And I wonder do you feel
Me a million miles away
'Cause I've been needing

To send
Love across the wire to the only one
My heart is waiting for
I send
Love across the wire
Tell her I'll be here
Until she's in my loving arms
It won't be long
Just a few more weeks from home
So I call you on the phone
To say I love you
Gonna send a card a day
All the time that I'm away
I miss you madly

I send
Love across the wire to the only one
My heart is waiting for
I send
Love across the wire
Tell her I'll be here
Until she's in my loving arms
It won't be long

Gonna kiss and hold you tight
Love you girl with all my might
Nothing's gonna change my love
No one else can love you like I do
'Cause you're the one my heart is waiting for
(Repeat Chorus 2)
