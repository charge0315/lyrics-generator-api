Come on, baby
Hey, ooh, baby
I need your lovin', baby
Hey, oh, yeah
Need your love

Now that I'm all alone
No one to turn to, no one to call my own
Suddenly, I realized
That the love you had for me was so sincere

I took advantage of your love, girl
And I don't even know what I was thinking of, baby
But now I feel so empty inside
And I need your loving back
'Cause this feelings I can't hide

Come back home, to me
You will see a different man (You will, a different man)
Come back home, to me (Yeah)
Girl, I didn't understand
Why you took your love from me

Come on, come on

Oh, so many broken promises
I always seem to let you down
It's not wonder that you cared for me
'Cause when you needed me
I was never around

They say the love is give and take
Too much misfortune, I could never give
I took for granted that you'd be back
Give me one more chance, I've loved you, girl

Come back home, to me (Girl, I need your lovin' back)
You will see a different man (You will, a different man)
Come back home, to me
Girl, I didn't understand
Just give me one more chance
Come back home, to me (Oh-oh)
You will see a different man (I'm so tired of livin' by myself)
Come back home, to me (Come back, baby)
Girl, I didn't understand
I need your lovin'
I need your lovin', girl, yeah-eah

I took advantage of your love, girl
And I don't even know what I was thinkin' of, baby
But now I feel so empty inside
Just give me one more chance, I've loved you, girl

Come back home, to me (Girl, I need your lovin' back)
You will see a different man (Just give me one more chance)
Come back home, to me (Oh)
Girl, I didn't understand (Girl, I didn't understand)
Come back home, to me (And now I need your love, girl, I want your love)
You will see a different man (Please, come back to me)
Come back home, to me (Can't live without you, girl, just gotta have your love)
Girl, I didn't understand (I need you, need you in my life)

I want your love (Come back for lovin')
I need your lovin' (Oh, I'm thinkin' of you)
Please, come back to me, baby (Can't live without you)
I want your lovin' (Give me another)
I need your lovin' (Chance, I'll treat your better)
Please, come back to me, baby (Love me, don't worry)
Come back home, to me (You better come back, baby)
Please, I'm begging it, baby
I'm begging it, baby
I'm begging it, baby
Come back home, to me (I'm on my knees, I'm on my knees)
Come on, baby (Come on, baby)

I want your lovin' (Come back home, to me)
I need your lovin'
I want your lovin' (Come back home, to me)
I need your lovin'
Come back home, to me
