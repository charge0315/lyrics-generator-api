Start with a man and you have one
Add on a woman and then you have two
Add on a child and what have you got?
You've got more than three
You've got what they call a family
Living together
Growing together
Just being together
That's how it starts
Three loving hearts all
Pulling together
Working together
Just building together
That makes you strong
If things go wrong
We'll still get along somehow
Living and growing together
It just takes wood to build a house
Fill it with people and you have a home
Fill it with love and people take root
It's just like a tree
Where each branch becomes a family that's
Living together
Growing together
Just being together
That's how it starts
Three loving hearts all
Pulling together
Working together
Just building together
That makes you strong
If things go wrong
We'll still get along somehow
Living and growing together
Still get along somehow
Living and growing together
Living together
Growing together
Just being together
That's how it starts
Three loving hearts all
Pulling together
Working together
Just building together
That makes you strong
If things go wrong
We'll still get along somehow
Living and growing
Just like we're doing now, together
