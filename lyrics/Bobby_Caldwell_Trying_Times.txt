Ordinary people living ordinary lives
Each with their own problems
Some who never will survive
It's hard to get ahead
And not commit some kind of crime
In these trying times
Lately I've been taking stock of what is dear to me
Please don't ask me how but up till now I've failed to see
You're the only reason I haven't lost my mind
In these trying times
And the world has a way of making life a grind
Till all you want to do is lay your head down
And if we stick together on this uphill climb
It's for sure gonna make it
In these trying times
Ordinary people have to bear the heavy load
Who can keep their balance
Travelling such a troubled road
You're the only reason I take it all in stride
In these trying times
And the world has a way of making life a grind
Till all you want to do is lay your head down
And if we stick together on this uphill climb
It's for sure gonna make it
In these trying times
You're the only reason I take it all in stride
I thought I ought to tell you so
In these trying times
