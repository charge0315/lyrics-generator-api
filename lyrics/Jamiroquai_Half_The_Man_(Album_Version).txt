Every bird will sing the melody of our love tune
Oh, yesterday I was half the man I'd used to be
Maybe that's because you're the other half of me
Like the spring in bloom the summer of our love is soon
Every bird will sing the melody of our love tune
Send down from above unconditionally love
Likened to a flower stronger love grows by the hour
Stormy weather days make us go our separate ways
Where our love was so at ease
Now you've got me down on my knees, hey
Yesterday I was brighter than the morning sun
Now my love is lost and lonely days have just begun
A solitary chair for a silent love affair
A king has lost his throne, now he sits alone, hey, hey
Yeah, yeah, every bird will sing, yeah, oh, now
Every bird will sing, every bird will sing the
Sing the melody of the love tune
Oh and every bird, every bird
Every bird will sing the melody of our love tune
Hey, I wanna tell you
Oh, yesterday I was half the man I'd used to be, oh
Maybe that's because you're the other half of me
Like the spring in bloom the summer of our love is soon
Now, every bird will sing the melody of our love tune
Oh, yeah
Every bird will sing the melody, the melody
Did I tell you, darling?
Yesterday I was half the man I'd used to be, oh
Maybe that's because you're the other half of me
Like the spring in bloom the summer of our love is soon
Every bird will sing the melody of our love tune
Every bird, oh, every bird will sing the melody of our love tune
Every bird, oh, every bird
Every bird will sing the melody of our love tune
Every bird, every bird will sing the melody of our love tune
