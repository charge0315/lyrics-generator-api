Oh, here we go!
Yeah yeah
Yesterday I saw my love light shine
Straight ahead in front of me
You never really know
When love will come or go
But yesterday I was alone
Suddenly I walked you home
I never really knew
What love could make me do
128
I'll send the message in a bottle (I'll send the message)
Trust in the mercy of the sea (Ooh-ooh)
Stormy weather (Ooh-ooh), oh yeah  (Ooh-ooh)
Waitin' for love to set me free
Every day I watch the tide roll in
Stay until it rolls away
Though nothing's on the shore
I'm running back for more
I'll send the message in a bottle (I'll send the message)
Pray for the mercy of the sea  (Ooh-ooh)
Stormy weather (Ooh-ooh), oh yeah (Ooh-ooh)
Waitin' for love to rescue me
Hey! Feels so good (So good), woo
And it feels so nice (So nice)
When love comes around
I feel good, (So good) so good, so good, so good
And it feels so nice, woo (So nice)
Ow! Feels so good

Yeah, it feels so good, woo (So good)
And it feels so nice (So nice)
When love comes around
And I feel good (So good)
Hey! Gonna make her feel nice (So nice)
When love comes around
I feel good, woo (So good)
So good, so good, so good
(So nice) Come on, baby
Make me feel good (So good)
Get up, get up, get up, get up (So nice)
Hey, baby, I feel good (So good)
Woo, come on, come on
Yeah, baby, nice, ow…
