Never know how much I love you
Never know how much I care
When you put your arms around me
I get a fever, that's so hard to bear
You give me fever, when you kiss me
Fever when you hold me tight
Fever, in the morning
And fever all through the night
Sun lights up the daytime
Moon lights up the night
I light up when you call my name
And I know I'm gonna treat you right
You give me fever, when you kiss me
Fever when you hold me tight
Fever, in the morning
Fever all through the night
Everybody's got the fever
That is something you all know
Fever isn't such a new thing
Fever started long ago
Romeo loved Juliet
Juliet, she felt the same
When he put his arms around her
He said "Julie Baby, You're my flame"
Thou givest fever
When he kisseth
Fever with thy flaming youth
Fever, I'm afire
Fever, yeah I burn forsooth
Captain Smith and Pocahontas
Had a very mad affair
When her Daddy tried to kill him
She said, "Daddy, Oh, Don't you dare!"
He gives me fever
With his kisses
Fever when he holds me tight
Fever, I'm his Misses
Oh Daddy, won't you treat him right?
Now you've listened to my story
Here's the point that I have made
Chicks were meant to give you fever
Be it Fahrenheit or Centigrade
It gives you fever, when you're kissing
Fever, if you live or learn
Fever, 'till you sizzle
What a lovely way to burn
They give you fever, when you kiss them
Fever, if you live and learn
Fever, 'till you sizzle
What a lovely way to burn (They give you fever)
What a lovely way to burn (They give you fever)
What a lovely way to burn (They give you fever)
What a lovely way to burn (They give you fever)
What a lovely way to burn (They give you fever)
What a lovely way to burn
