Gotta get it!
Gotta get it!
(Plastic classic)
Hey! Yo!
Hey! Yo!

Can't forget my backstreet get down
Ghost electric, telephone bones
Blowing like horns, bound to shout!
Nasty distortion, animal slow jams
All my friends got dixie soul
Rocking the plastic, taking the low boat
Rough as a river, cowboy nowboy
Biscuit chicken hittin' the wicket
Sandwich soul, a buffalo
Make it back for the finger pointin' down
Ooh, gotta get it, plastic classic
Totem poles in the briefcase shows

Get that brand new action!
Gonna let me get with the jet effect
Get that brand new action!
Gonna let me get with the jet effect

Lonesome whistle blows my fuckin' phone
Last Saturday night, I couldn't find my spice
Sippin' whiskey in the midnight shade
Vandalizing as I had no time
Up the river and round the road
A traveling man with a tricky hand
Soda-pop (ooh) sizzling like slime
Get to slippin', stoppin' and realize

Get that brand new action!
Gonna let me get with the jet effect
Get that brand new action!
Gonna let me get with the jet effect

Diskobox, ooh!
Diskobox, ooh!
Diskobox, ooh!
Diskobox, ooh!
Diskobox, ooh!
Diskobox, ooh!
Diskobox, ooh!
