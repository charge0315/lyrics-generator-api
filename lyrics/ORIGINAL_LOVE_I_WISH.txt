I’m in love with you
And everything you do
But i’m done
Chasing waterfalls
But i’m in love with you
I’m not enough for you
There’s nothing to pursue
And i’d run
Away from it all
But i’m in love with you
It’s all coming through
And the numbing too
I can’t feel
Nothing's real
But I’m in love with you
You know it’s true
I’m in love with you
Love me too
Please won’t you?
I’m in love with you
