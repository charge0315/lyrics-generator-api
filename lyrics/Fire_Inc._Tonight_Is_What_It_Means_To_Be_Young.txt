I've got a dream 'bout an angel on the beach
And the perfect waves are starting to come
His hair is flying out in ribbons of gold
And his touch has got the power to stun
I've got a dream 'bout an angel in the forest
Enchanted by the edge of a lake
His body's flowing in the jewels of light
And the earth below is starting to shake

But I don't see any angels in the city
I don't hear any holy choirs sing
And if I can't get an angel, I can still get a boy
And a boy'd be the next best thing
The next best thing to an angel
A boy'd be the next best thing

I've got a dream 'bout a boy in a castle
And he's dancing like a cat on the stairs
He's got the fire of a prince in his eyes
And the thunder of a drum in his ears
I've got a dream 'bout a boy on a star
Lookin' down upon the rim of the world
He's there all alone and dreamin' of someone like me
I'm not an angel, but at least I'm a girl

I've got a dream when the darkness is over
We'll be lyin' in the rays of the sun
But it's only a dream and tonight is for real
You'll never know what it means
But you'll know how it feels
It's gonna be over (Over)
Before you know it's begun (Before you know it's begun)
Oh, it's all we really got tonight
Stop your cryin', hold on (Tonight)
Before you know it, it's gone (Tonight)
Tonight is what it means to be young
Tonight is what it means to be young

Let the revels begin
Let the fire be started
We're dancing for the restless and the brokenhearted
Let the revels begin
Let the fire be started
We're dancing for the desperate and the brokenhearted
Let the revels begin
Let the fire be started (Tonight is what it means to be young)
We're dancing for the restless and the brokenhearted
(Before you know it, it's gone)
Let the revels begin
Let the fire be started (Tonight is what it means to be young)
We're dancing for the desperate and the brokenhearted
(Before you know it, it's gone)

Say a prayer in the darkness for the magic to come
No matter what it seems
Tonight is what it means to be young
(Tonight is what it means to be young)
Tonight is what it means to be young
Before you know it, it's gone (Tonight is what it means to be young)
Tonight is what it means to be young
Before you know it, it's gone

(Ah, ah, ah, ah)
(Ah, ah, ah, ah)
(Ah, ah, ah, ah)
(Ah, ah, ah, ah)

I've got a dream when the darkness is over

Before you know it's begun (Before you know it's begun)
(Ah) It's all we really got tonight
Stop your cryin', hold on (Tonight)
Before you know it, it's gone (Tonight)
Tonight is what it means to be young
Tonight is what it means to be young

Say a prayer in the darkness for the magic to come
'Cause no matter what it seems
Tonight is what it means to be young

No matter what it seems
Tonight is what it means to be young

Nothing's gonna stop us if our aim is true
