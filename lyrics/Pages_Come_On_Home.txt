Call you, telephone, far away, I'm so all alone
Turn around, see your face, you're the one my mind won't erase
Come on home babe - I can't live alone
Come on home babe - I can't live without your love
I know I'll never be the same, if you don't come home babe
Find myself, empty room, I want nothing else but the touch of you
Stare away, try to sleep, but the love we made just keeps calling me
Come on home babe - I can't live alone
Come on home babe - I just can't live without your love
I know I'll never be the same, if you don't come home babe
(Solo)
Come on home babe - I can't live alone
Come on home babe - don't you know I can't live without your love
Come on home babe - you know I'll never leave you
Come on, come on, come on
Come on home babe - I can't live alone
Come on home babe - don't you know I can't live without your love
Come on home babe - I can't live alone
Come on, come on, come on... (to fade)
