Hey, hey, hey

I was born in Lil' Rock
Had a childhood sweetheart
We were always hand in hand
I wore high top shoes and shirt tails
Suzy was in pigtails
I knew I loved her even then
You know my papa disapproved it
My mama boo-hooed it
But I told them time and time again
"Don't you know I was made to love her
Build my world all around her"
Yeah, hey, hey, hey

She's been my inspiration
Showed appreciation
For the love I gave her through the years
Like a sweet magnolia tree
My love blossomed tenderly
My life grew sweeter through the years
I know that my baby loves me
My baby needs me
That's why we made it through the years
I was made to love her
Worship and adore her
Hey, hey, hey

All through thick and thin
Our love just won't end
'Cause I love my baby, love my baby, hey
My baby loves me
My baby needs me
And I know I ain't going nowhere

I was knee-high to a chicken
When that love bug bit me
I had the fever with each passing year
Oh, even if the mountain tumbles
If this whole world crumbles
By her side I'll still be standing there
'Cause I was made to love her
I was made to live for her, yeah, hey hey, hey
Ah, I was made to love her
Build my world all around her
Hey, hey, hey

Ooh baby, I was made to please her
You know Stevie ain't gon' leave her, no
Hey, hey, hey, ooh-wee, baby
