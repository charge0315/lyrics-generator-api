I must have done something right
It wasn't in this life
But I know it's true
I can't help but wonder
What you ever see in me
What did I do

When our time on earth is through
I will still be loving you
Oh my baby

When a man knows that he's found a good thing
He will try to hold on
Yes he will
I'm no fool and I know if your love were gone
I could not go on
Rina my love

Not a single day goes by
When I don't see you try
To help pull me through
As long as stars are in the sky
Rina I will try
To bring them to you

When our time on earth is through
I will still be loving you

When a man knows that he's found a good thing
He will try to hold on
Yes he will
I'm no fool and I know if your love were gone
I could not go on
Rina my love

I go crazy
When you go away
And my heart begins to yearn
Then the hours turn into lonely days
What would I do if you never returned

When our time on earth is through
I will still be loving you
 X2
When a man knows that he's found a good thing
He will try to hold on
Yes he will
I'm no fool and I know if your love were gone
I could not go on
Rina my love
