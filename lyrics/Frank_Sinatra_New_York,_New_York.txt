Start spreading the news, you're leaving today (Tell me, Frank)
I want to be a part of it: New York, New York
Your vagabond shoes, they are longing to stray
And step around the heart of it: New York, New York

I wanna wake up in that city that doesn't sleep
And find your king of the hill, top of the heap

Your small town blues, they're melting away
Gonna make a brand new start of it in old New York

You always make it there, you make it anywhere
It's up to you, New York, New York

Da da da da da
Da da da ba ba ba
In New York, New York

I want to wake up in that city that doesn't  sleeps
And find I'm king of the hill, top of the list
You bet, end of the line, king of the hill

These little town blues, they have all melting away
And I'm gonna make a brand new start of it
Right there in old New York (You better believe it, folks)
You always make it there, you make make it anywhere
Come on, come through, New York, New York
New York!
