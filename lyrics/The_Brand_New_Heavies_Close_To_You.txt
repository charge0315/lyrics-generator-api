Ooh, ooh, closer, closer, yeah...
Ooh, ooh, closer, closer
Long ago, seems so far away
I fell in love with you, and that feeling remained
Looking back I recall how you never could see
All the feelings I kept deep inside that I didn't set free
But still I, I wanna be close to you, I wanna be close to you
Still I, I wanna get close to you, I wanna get close to you
All of my close friends said I lived in a dream
But it didn't matter at all, cuz they just couldn't see
That your guitar was just playing for me
Never gonna listen to them cuz I still want to be
And still I, I wanna be close to you, I wanna be close to you
Still I, I wanna get close to you, I wanna get close to you
Still I, I wanna be close to you, I wanna be close to you
Still I, I wanna get close to you, I wanna get close to you
Your guitar is just playing for me
Now I'm gonna let my feelings show, cuz I still wanna be...
And still I, I wanna be close to you, I wanna be close to you
Still I, I wanna get close to you, I wanna get close to you
Still I, I wanna be close to you, I wanna be close to you
Still I, I wanna get close to you, I wanna get close to you
Yea, yea
Closer, closer, I wanna be, closer, closer, I wanna be...
