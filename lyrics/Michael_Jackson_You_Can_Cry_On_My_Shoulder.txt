Just because you know I
Love you so much
Don't be afraid to tell me you're sad because
You lost his love
Though your love is not for me
I don't wanna see you in misery
So come on, baby, come on

You can cry on my shoulder
You can cry on my shoulder
And bring all your troubles to me
All your troubles to me

Big girls ain't supposed to cry
If you do, I'll understand
Maybe I can show you how you can
Win his love again
It may seem strange, I know
But it's just that I love you so
Come on, baby, come on

You can cry on my shoulder
You can cry on my shoulder
And bring all your troubles to me
(Bring them to me, girl)

Now, you've given him all you had
He better stop treating you so bad
Come on, baby (Come on, come on)
Come on, oh

You can cry on my shoulder, yes, you can, girl
You can cry on my shoulder
And bring all your troubles to me
(Bring them to me, girl)
Yeah, babe, yes, you can, now
Darling, ooh, ooh, yes, yes, you can, girl
I'll be there to help

You can cry, you can cry, you can cry
Baby
(You can cry on my shoulder)
Oh, yeah, babe, yeah, babe
(You can cry on my shoulder)
You can cry, you can cry
