Can't get enough of you
When we oooo

Hello my love, wish you were here
So many things in my heart that I'd like to share
A few warm thoughts, a subtle smile
Our conversation through silence could last all night
At ease my mind to see your face
Those sexy eyes could calm my heart of rage
You speak my name, I touch your
The chemistry only true love could understand

You've opened my soul to happiness
And shown me new ways of love
Smooth is life's travels with you beside me
I'll never walk alone

Can't get enough of you
When we oooo
Can't get enough of you
When we oooo
Can't get enough of you

You can give you, all you can give
You taught me love, laugh, you taught me to live
At rainbow's end that pot of gold
Can't hold a light to you 'cause you're my heart and soul

Such passionate love, the love we make
In tune, our bodies are one
When loving's done, the passion's still strong
'Cause spiritually, we are one

Can't get enough of you (Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-bah)
(Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo) When we oooo
Can't get enough of you (Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-bah)
(Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo) When we oooo
Can't get enough of you (Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-bah)
(Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo) When I oooo
Can't get enough of you (Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-bah)
(Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo) When we oooo
Can't get enough of you

Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-bah

Such passionate love, the love we make
In tune, our bodies are one
When loving's done, the passion's still strong
'Cause spiritually, we are as one

Can't get enough of you (Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-bah)
Baby, when we oooo
Can't get enough of you (Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-bah)
When we oooo
I can't get enough of you (Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-bah)
(Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo) When I oooo
Can't get enough of you (Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-bah)
(Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo) When we oooo
Can't get enough of you (Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-bah)
(Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo)
