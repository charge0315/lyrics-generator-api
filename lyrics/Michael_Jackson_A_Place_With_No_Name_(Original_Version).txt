As I drove across on the highway, my jeep began to rock
I didn't know what to do, so I stopped and got out
And looked down, I noticed I'd got a flat
So I walked out, parked the car like sideways
So I can find what I can fix
I looked around, there were no cars on the highway
I felt a strange, feeling like a mist
I walked down toward the end of a road
And in the fog, a woman appeared
She said, "Don't you worry my friend
I'll take care, take my hand
I'll take you there"

Ooh-oh-oh
Take me to a place without no name
Take me to a place without no name

As she took me right through the fog
I seen a beautiful city appear
A'Where kids are playin' and people are laughin' and a'smilin' an' nothin' to fear
She said, "This is the place where no people have pain with love and happiness"
She turned around, looked down in my eyes and started cryin'
And grabbed my hand, you've got a friend
Ohh-oh-oh-oh-oh

Take me to a place without no name (No name)
Take me to a place without no name (A place without no name)
Take me to a place (Take me) without no name
(Take me, take me, a place without no name)
Take me to a place without no name
Woh-oh-oh
Yeah, doggone, oh-oh

She started likin' me, kissin' me, and huggin' me
She didn't really, really want me to leave
She showed me places I've never seen and things I've never done
This really looks like a lot of fun
I've seen the grass and the skies and the birds
And the flowers surrounded by the trees
This place is filled with love and happiness
How in the world, could I wanna leave?

So then I went in my pocket, took my wallet on out
With my pictures of my family and girl
This is the place that you choose to be with me
When you thought you could be in another world

Oh oh-oh
Take me to a place without no name (Doggone, take me, no name)
(Take me to a place without no name)
Nah nah nah-nah-nah-nah
Nah-nah-nah nah nah (A place without no name)
(Take me, doggone, a place without no name)
Take me to a place without no name
No no no!

Nah nah nah-nah-nah-nah
Nah-nah-nah nah nah
(A place without no name)
Nah nah nah-nah-nah-nah
Nah-nah-nah nah nah
(A place without no name)
Nah nah nah-nah-nah-nah
Nah-nah-nah nah nah
(A place without no name)
Nah nah nah-nah-nah-nah
(A place without)
Nah-nah-nah nah nah
Nah nah nah-nah-nah-nah
Take me, take me, take me
Nah-nah-nah nah nah
(A place without no name)
Nah nah nah-nah-nah-nah
Nah-nah-nah nah nah
(A place without no name)
Nah nah nah-nah-nah-nah
Nah-nah-nah nah nah
(A place without no name)
