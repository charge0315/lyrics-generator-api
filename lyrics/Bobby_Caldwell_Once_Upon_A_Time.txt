It wasn't long ago
We had the kind of love you'd only find
In fairytales
And not so long ago
We were content to be the young and starry eyed
Our lives were simple like a nursery rhyme
Once upon a time

(Do you remember baby, do you, remember)

Do you remember when
We took vacations
(Acapulco, in the summertime)
Yes we were carefree then
Without the pressures of a world that's so unkind
Before the little things that undermine
Once upon a time

Before we tried to change each other
Sometimes lovers can't be friends
Once upon a time
We rolled in the covers
Can we follow that road back again
(Remember)

It wasn't long ago
We vowed our hearts would be
Forever intertwined
When making love was all we had in mind
Once upon a time

Do you remember baby, do you
Do you remember baby, do you, remember
Remember
Remember

Do you, remember, remember
