Bars of gold, shiny diamonds
All the pearls in the deep blue sea
They could never equal
What you mean to me
And all the rings, on all the fingers
Of all the Kings and Queens
They won't reveal, how I feel
Cause you are there when I need you
And you are there in the morning when the sun comes up
You are there in the evening
You are there when I slip up
You'll be there in the winter time
You'll be there and be true
From now on I'll be there for you
Cause you -- you mean the world to me
You mean the world to me
And I want you and all the world to see
You mean the world to me
All the cold in Alaska, and all the music down in Tennessee
All the tea in China, can't take you from me
The highest mountains the greenest valleys
All the stars above, can't replace
My favorite face
Cause you were there in the hard times
You were there when I was ready to give up
You were there when there was no one else
And you were there when I messed up
You'll be there in the long run
You'll be there and be true
From now on I'll be there for you
Cause you, you mean the world to me
You mean the world to me
And I want you and all the world to see
You mean the world
You mean the world
