Mmmmm, yeah
Blessed that be the ties that bind
Whoaaa
Blessed that be the ties that bind
Whoaaa
Blessed that be the ties that bind
Do you ever take the time to concentrate your mind and listen, ooo yeah
Dancing to the music to your inner soul
Marvel at the beauty that nature holds
(Spread your wings to freedom)
Erasing from your mind all the doubt you see
Soaring like an eagle to your victory
Your loving heart will guide you, you, you
Blessed, blessed. Ahhhh, yeah, ohhh yeah, yeah
My soul feels good about the ties that bind me and you, and all mankind, together
Together
My soul feels good about the ties that bind me and you, and all mankind, together
Whoaaa
Blessed that be the ties that bind
Me and you, and all mankind. Whoaaa, ooooo
Glorify your love, place it far above all other, ooooo, yeah
Waken to the power of your mother's love
And precious memories (gather little children)
Pull your face in view to the rising sun
Flame of love is a gift to you
Burning to beat of your soul, alright
Blessed, blessed, ooooooo, yeah, yeah, oooooo, yeah, yeah
Blessed, blessed, blessed, blessed, oo, ooooo
Blessed, blessed, blessed, blessed, oo, ooooo
My soul feels good about the ties that bind me and you, and all mankind, together
