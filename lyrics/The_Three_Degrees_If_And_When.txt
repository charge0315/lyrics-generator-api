Through these eyes
I can see loneliness heading my way
The light of love has gone out
Now your shadow's gone away
You took away the sound
The touch, the smell, my sight
To see your smile
Oh, if and when
You're headed back this way
Where love was found
Want you to know this girl
Will be around
(Still be around)
If you decide to mend a heart
That you broke in pieces
You told me when we first met
That you'd soon be going away
Because there is somebody else
Demanding all your time
She took away the sound
The touch, the smell, my sight
To see your smile
Oh, if and when
You're headed back this way
Where love was found
Want you to know this girl
Will be around
(Still gonna be around)
If you decide to mend a heart
That you broke in pieces
Oh baby...
Loneliness, loneliness
Come on, come on back to me
I need your love
If and when
(Ooh baby)
You're headed back this way
Where love was found
(Ooh I need you)
Want you to know this girl
Will sill be around
(I'll still be around)
If and when (if and when, yeah)
You're back this way
(Come on back to me)
Where love was found
(Please, please, please)
Want you to know this girl
Will still be around
If and when (if and when)
You're back this way again
If and when...
