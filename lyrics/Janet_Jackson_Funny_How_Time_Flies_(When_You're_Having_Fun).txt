Il me plaît d'être avec toi
Je ne sais pas où
Où le temps s'est enfui
Oh je t'aime mon chéri

Funny how time flies when you're having fun
Ooh, baby
Funny how time flies when you're having fun (Fun)
Oh, baby

I don't know where it all went
Time passed us by
Just when it seemed the fun began
Ooh

Funny how time flies when you're having fun, please stay
Funny how time flies (Please stay) when you're having fun, mmm

But time never ends
Let's find the time
To get together once again, someday soon

Funny how time flies when you're having fun, mmm, yeah, ooh
Funny how time flies when you're having fun (Fun)

Don't you ever leave (Funny how time flies when you're having fun)
Don't you ever go
Say you love me so (Funny how time flies when you're having fun)
Mmm

Funny how time flies when you're having fun (When you're having fun, yeah)
Funny how time flies when you're having fun

Je ne sais pas où le temps s'est enfui
Il me plaît d'être avec toi
I really don't know where all the time went
I really have to go
Stop, stop
Oh, I really have to go
Oh, I really have to go
One more time?
Oh je t'aime mon chéri
Oh, oh, oh
Š'il vous plaît
Š'il vous plaît
