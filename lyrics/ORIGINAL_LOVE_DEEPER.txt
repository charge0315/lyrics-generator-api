It doesn't matter the circumstances
All have made it bad romances
That have been through in my life
I've never known other way
From the moment that I met you
There has been no single doubt in my mind
What we have found right here is so real
Oh yes!
This is the big love oooh
This is the big love oooh
This is the big love
I've been waiting all my life
I think I'm gonna love you more
Than I've ever done before
Is the big lovе
I don't have to search no more
That's what I found
Yеah! Is the big love
I don't have to search no more
Oh no! No! No!
Dancin' moving
I'll there if you should call
I'll catch you when you fall
I'll help you use the pain - make you strong and rose again
I can search my whole life through
Without no guaranties that I'll ever find another like you
Let me tell you
This is the big love oooh
This is the big love oh
This is the big love
I've been waiting all my life
I think I'm gonna love you more
Than I've ever done before
Gonna love you more
More!
I got a big love, hey! for U
Come and get it babe
Come on! Come on!
It's big - dancing
I got a big love, hey! 4U
It's BIG
