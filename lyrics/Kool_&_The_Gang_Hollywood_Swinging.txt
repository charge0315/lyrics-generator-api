Hey, hey, hey
What ya got to say?
Hey, hey, hey
What ya got to say?
Hollywood
Hollywood swinging
Hollywood
Hollywood swinging

I remember not too long ago
I went to a theater
And I saw the Kool and the Gang show
I always wanted to fit into a band
To sing my songs
And then become a bad piano playing man
So here I am in this Hollywood city
The city of the stars, movies, women and cars
Well I guess, I guess I'll stay

I said hey, hey, hey
What ya got to say?
I said hey, hey, hey
What ya got to say?
Hollywood
Hollywood swinging
Hollywood
Hollywood swinging
Hollywood swinging, swinging
(Hollywood swinging, Hollywood swinging)
(Hollywood swinging, Hollywood swinging)
(Hollywood swinging, Hollywood swinging)
(Hollywood swinging, Hollywood swinging)
(Hollywood swinging, Hollywood now swinging)
(Hollywood swinging, Hollywood now swinging)
