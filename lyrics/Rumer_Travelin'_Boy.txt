Wake up my love beneath the midday sun
Alone once more alone
This travelling boy was only passing through
But he will always think of you
One night of love beside a stranger's smile
As warm as I have known
A travelling boy and only passing through
But one who'll always think of you
Take my place out on the road again
I must do what I must do
Yes I know we were lovers
But a drifter discovers
That a perfect love won't always last forever
I won't say that I'll be back again
'Cause time alone will tell
So no goodbyes for one just passing through
But he will always think of you
Yes I know we were lovers
But a drifter discovers
That a perfect love won't always last forever
I won't say that I'll be back again
'Cause time alone will tell
So no goodbyes for one just passing through
But one who'll always think of you
One who'll will always think of you
