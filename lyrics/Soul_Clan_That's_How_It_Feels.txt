That's how I feel
That's how I feel
The storm may rise
Oh, and that old bad wind might blow (Sing your song!)
But I'm gonna hold on to this little woman I got
Man I'm never, never, never gonna let her go
Listen here
'Cause that's how I feel
That's how I feel
Tell 'em about it
My mother died when I was a baby boy
I had to leave home, yes I did
Go out in this wide world lookin' for love and joy
I said listen to me while I sing
That's how I feel
That's how I feel
Wait, listen to me, ha
You see some folks are often blamed and accused
Usually things for they don't do
But you see I know that everybody needs somebody
And I'm so grateful baby that I've got you
If some folks was to ask me right now (I'm in love, I'm in love)
Tell me, how do you feel? (I'm in love, I'm in love)
I have to describe this pretty feeling inside me
As being true love (True love)
Darling I know that it's you
Solomon, let me tell you something, it's a true story
I got one sister, Lord and, eight of us boys
I was 13 years old, yeah, oh yeah
Before I got my first Christmas toy
And let me tell you this
That's how I feel
That's how I feel
Go on listen to me
Tell 'em about it Joe Tex
I remember the first day
I was six years old, y'all
My mama took me to school
Listen to me
Things were so tough back then y'all
I had to wear my daddy's old rugrat shoes
Listen
That's how I feel
That's how I feel
That's how I feel
Oh, that's how I feel right now
That's how I feel
I want everybody,  sing one time
That's how I feel, that's how I feel, that's how I feel
