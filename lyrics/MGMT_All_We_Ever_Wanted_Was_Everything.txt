All we ever wanted was everything
All we ever got was cold
Get up, eat jelly
Sandwich bars and barbed wire
Squash every week into a day

The sound of drums is calling
The sound of the drum has called
Flash of youth shoot out of the darkness
Factorytown

Oh, to be the cream
Oh, to be the cream
Oh, to be the cream
Oh, to be the cream
