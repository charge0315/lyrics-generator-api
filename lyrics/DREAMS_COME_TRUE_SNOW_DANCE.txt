Sick to my stomach with cramps left to right
But I swore I wouldn’t let it ruin the night
Unbearable soon, so I race to the bathroom
And they start to play the song I wanted to dance to with you

I hear the crooning as I’m in stall crying
Feel like it’s Christmas spent far off on Titan
I’m stuck away from you, my pants at my feet
My only slow dance is the shaking of my knees as I
Choke on my tears that spill right down my face
I imagine you stood out there in disarray
Coz God knows I am, you text me it’s playing
I reply “damn,” coz I’ve naught else to say
God, I’m so dumb, why’d I not listen sooner?
I could’ve just skipped Firework or Flo Rida
But no, here we are, and I’m missing the song
We’d play at our wedding as wе remember it bеing on tonight
(So I cry)
(So I cry)

I come out of my cave with shirt still untucked
Coda fades out, have you found your true love?
I can’t bear to look you in the eyes
So once again, I cry
I’m so weak
Exist to beg for pity
I cry in the corner of the dance
In your arms
You hold me
I loathe me
You hold me
You comfort me

My mood improves, I suck it up for you
I put on a smile that matches my suit
Your favourite song comes on, who would’ve thought?
That one song from Rio, huh, what’re the odds?
We dance and we cheer as we take to the floor
Smack-dab in the centre, all others in awe
I bet they’re wishing they could be us
I bet they wish they have what we have
(But I’m still kinda sad)

When it is done, we head on home
I’ve lost my voice, such a pain in my throat
I couldn’t not belt Bohemian Rhapsody
Lyrics about me, about everybody
And no one

We head into your room
I start to take off my suit
You say, “Wait, no, not yet,”
So I put it back and sit on your bed
You set up your lights to be like at the dance
You stand me up and take my hands
Then suddenly I hear his croon again
You’re playing our song
You’re playing our song

We dance slowly, the lights flickering
Forgot some stuff, or so you say
But I think it’s perfect just how it is
I wouldn’t have it any other way
You’re in my arms and I am in yours
I cry much greater than ever before
But it’s happy
Coz you love me
