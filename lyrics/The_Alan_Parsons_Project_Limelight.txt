I can see the glow of a distant sun
I can feel it inside
Maybe this day could be the one
I can hear the roar of a distant crowd
They are waiting for me
Calling my name, shouting out loud
Holding on isn't always easy
I ain't gonna change my mind
Limelight
You were all I ever wanted since it all began
Limelight
Shining on me, telling the world who I am
Limelight
Don't let me slip right through your fingers
There's a long way to fall
After all the years of waiting
I'm gonna show them all
I can see the world in a different light
Now it's easy to say
Where I went wrong, what I did right
I can hear the beat of a different drum
Take it all in my stride
Hold my head high, second to none
Holding on wasn't always easy
Nothing can change my mind
Limelight
You were all I ever wanted since it all began
Limelight
Shining on me, telling the world who I am
Limelight
Don't let it slip right through your fingers
There's a long way to fall
After all the years of waiting
I'm gonna show them all
Maybe the role's not easy
Maybe the prize is small
After all the years of waiting
I'm gonna show them all
