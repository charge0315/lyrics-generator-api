I surrender
Ooh hoo hoo
I surrender it all
Ho ho
I've never felt this way before
There's nothing else I could want more
Than somethin' real
Only passion can reveal, yeah
With body and soul
I'm used to controlling every, everything
Now I can let go
Let down my guard and we'll see how far this love can go
I surrender my heart, I'm givin' up
And I don't wanna fight, I just wanna love
I surrender it all, I'm givin' in
To the power of love, surrender
This feels too good, can't bring me down
Feels like I could never touch ground
And how I've waited
To a love anticipated yeah, yeah
Umm, with body and mind
(Body and mind)
I know that there's time for every, everything
(Ooh ooh)
Now now I can let go, let down my guard
(I can let go)
And we'll see how far this love can go
I surrender my heart, I'm givin' up
And I don't wanna fight, I just wanna love
I surrender it all, I'm givin' in
To the power of love, surrender
And it's just to strong and I can't hold on
What used to be ain't clear to me
It's just a fantasy
I'm breakin' down right here right now
I want you to know, oh, gonna take you slow
And just let the feeling flow
