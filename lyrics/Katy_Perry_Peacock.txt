Word on the street, you got somethin' to show me, me
Magical, colorful, Mr. Mystery
I'm intrigued for a peek, heard it's fascinating
(C'mon, baby, let me see what you hiding underneath)
What's up your sleeve? Such a tease, wanna see the show
In 3D, a movie, heard it's beautiful
Be the judge and my girls gonna take a vote
(C'mon, baby, let me see what you hiding underneath)

I want the jaw-dropping, eye-popping
Head-turning, body-shocking
(Oh-oh-ayo, oh-oh, ayo)
I want my heart throbbing, ground shaking
Show stopping, amazing
(Oh-oh-ayo, oh-oh, ayo)

Are you brave enough to let me see your peacock?
Don't be a chicken, boy, stop acting like a bi-otch
I'ma peace out if you don't give me the payoff
C'mon, baby, let me see what you hiding underneath
Are you brave enough to let me see your peacock?
Whatcha waiting for, it's time for you to show it off
Don't be a shy kind of guy, I bet it's beautiful
C'mon, baby, let me see what you hiding underneath

I wanna see your peacock-cock-cock
Your peacock-cock
Your peacock-cock-cock
Your peacock
I wanna see your peacock-cock-cock
Your peacock-cock
Your peacock-cock-cock

I wanna see your...

Skip the talk, heard it all, time to walk the walk
Break me off, if you bad, show me who's the boss
Need some Goose to get loose, come on take a shot
(C'mon, baby, let me see what you hiding underneath)

I want the jaw-dropping, eye-popping
Head-turning, body-shocking
(Oh-oh-ayo, oh-oh, ayo)
I want my heart throbbing, ground shaking
Show stopping, amazing
(Oh-oh-ayo, oh-oh, ayo)

Are you brave enough to let me see your peacock?
Don't be a chicken, boy, stop acting like a bi-otch
I'ma peace out if you don't give me the payoff
C'mon, baby, let me see what you hiding underneath
Are you brave enough to let me see your peacock?

Oh my God, no exaggeration
Boy, all this time was worth the waiting
I just shed a tear
I am so unprepared
You got the finest architecture
End of the rainbow-looking treasure
Such a sight to see
And it's all for me

Are you brave enough to let me see your peacock? (Ha!)
Don't be a chicken, boy, stop acting like a bi-otch
I'ma peace out if you don't give me the payoff
