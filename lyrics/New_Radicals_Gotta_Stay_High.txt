One, two, three, four
High

I saw your eyes
I had to run away
Too deep in love
There were no words to say
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I just had to get high
One look inside
And I knew right away
I felt too much
I did not have the strength
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I just ran to get high

But lover
There's something about your pushing me, pulling me
That's saying don't go away

I saw your eyes
Fell back to yesterday
One lonely child
Until you let me stay
Yeah, yeah yeah
I had no one on my side
Good God, I think I'm falling
Too weak to stand
Too scared to love again
The dam has broke
My soul is spilling all over your hands
Take a look in my eyes

But lover
There's something about your pushing me, pulling me
That's saying don't go away

Yeah, yeah
La-la-la-la-la-la, ahh
One, two, three, four
La-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la, ooh, hoo
Ooh hoo, ooh hoo yeah

I see your eyes
I'll never run away
Too deep in love
Got just five words to say-ay-ay-ay
We just gotta stay high
