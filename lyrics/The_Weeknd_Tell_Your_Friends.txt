We are not the same, I am too reckless
I'm not tryna go in that direction
These niggas, they been doin' too much flexin'
And they about to call the wrong attention
And I don't got no patience, no more testin'
I do shit how I want, don't need no blessin'
XO niggas ain't nothin' to mess with
Nobody stoppin' us, oh, no, we destined
And everybody 'round you is so basic
I'm never rockin' white, I'm like a racist
I don't drink my liquor wit' a chase in
That money is the only thing I'm chasin'
And some dope dimes on some coke lines
Gimme head all night, cum four times
Baby girl just wanna smoke a pound
Do an ounce, get some dick, tell her friends about it

Go tell your friends about it (About it)
Go tell your friends about it (About it, hey)
Go tell 'em what you know, what you seen
How I roll, how I get it on the low (Oh, woah)
Go tell your friends about it (About it)
Go tell your friends about it
I'm that nigga with the hair
Singin' 'bout poppin' pills, (Yeah, yeah) fuckin' bitches, livin' life so trill

Last year I did all the politickin'
This year I'ma focus on the vision (That vision)
I think these hoes deserve another fixin' (Fixin')
I'm talkin' 'bout the ones from the beginnin' (Oh, oh, oh)
Don't believe the rumors, bitch, I'm still a user
I'm still rockin' camo and still roll with shooters
I'm a villain in my city, I just made another killin'
I'ma spend it all on bitches (On bitches)
And everybody fuckin', everybody fuckin' (Fuckin')
Pussy on the house, everybody fuckin' (Fuckin')
Man, I miss my city, man, it's been a minute (Been a minute)
MIA a habit, Cali was the mission (Ooh, woah)
Cruise through the west-end in my new Benz (Ooh, woah)
I'm just tryna live life through a new lens (Oh, woah, ho)
Drivin' by the streets I used to walk through
When I had no crib, I guess you call that shit a miracle

Go tell your friends about it (About it)
Go tell your friends about it (About it, hey)
Go tell 'em what you know, what you seen (Oh, ho-woah, oh)
How I roll, how I get it on the low
Go tell your friends about it (About it)
Go tell your friends about it
I'm that nigga with the hair
Singin' 'bout poppin' pills, (Yeah, yeah) fuckin' bitches, livin' life so trill

Roll some, think I’ll roll some
To know some, if we both honest
Who lasts? (Who lasts?)
Yeah, you lie (You lie)
Spent the whole summer
Tryna be at the wrong place at the right time
But I know what's mine when I see it
I know, know

My cousin said I made it big and it's unusual (Unusual)
She tried to take a selfie at my Grandma's funeral (Funeral)
Used to roam on Queen, now I sing Queen Street anthems (Queen Street anthems)
Used to hate attention, now I pull up in that wagon (That wagon)
And I was broken, I was broken, I was so broke (So broke)
I used to roam around the town when I was homeless (No, no, no, no, no)
Me and La Mar would rob a nigga for his Jordans
And flip it just to get these hoes another nose fix
Now we get faded when we want, girl, we got choices (Got choices)
Lay them on the fuckin' table, we got choices (Got choices)
And if they wanna fuck my niggas, they got choices (Got choices)

They told me not to fall in love, that shit is pointless
Yeah, that shit is pointless (Pointless)
They told me not to fall in love, that shit is pointless
Yeah, that shit is pointless (Pointless)
They told me not to fall in love, that shit is pointless

Go tell your friends about it (About it)
Go tell your friends about it (About it, hey)
Go tell 'em what you know, what you seen (Oh)
How I roll, how I get it on the low (Ooh, ooh)
Go tell your friends about it (About it)
Go tell your friends about it
I'm that nigga with the hair
Singin' 'bout poppin' pills, (Yeah, yeah) fuckin' bitches, livin' life so trill

Life so trill
(Politickin', yeah)
Life so trill
Life so trill (Life so trill)
(I'm that nigga with the—)
Life so trill
Life so trill (Ooh, ooh, ooh)

(Yeah, yeah)
Life so trill
