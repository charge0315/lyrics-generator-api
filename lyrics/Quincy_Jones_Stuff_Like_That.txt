Walked in the joint
They were lining up back to back
Anything you can name, no shame
Uh, uh, stuff like that

Do it, do it
Do it, do it
What makes you feel like doin' stuff like that?
What makes you feel like doin' stuff like that?

Before my eyes was the promise of paradise
Is she real? Can she feel? is she a dream?
If you know what I mean
'Cause she was built out of—

Stuff like that (Do it, do it)
Stuff like that (Do it, do it)
Stuff like that (Do it, do it)
Stuff like that (Do it, do it)

I knew I was captured
By the rhythm of the magic flute
Pulling and urging me
To taste the forbidden fruit
And though I felt naive
I did not want to leave, fever was in the air
(And all of a sudden, I didn't care)
(No reason why, just had to testify)

What makes you feel like doin' stuff like that?
What makes you feel like doin' stuff like that? (Makes you feel)
What makes you feel like doin' stuff like that?
What makes you feel like doin' stuff like that?
Do it, do it
Do it, do it
Do it, do it
Do it, do it

I knew I was captured

Pulling and urging me

And though I felt naive
I didn't want to leave, fever was in the air

(No reason why, just had to testify)

Do it, do it (Stuff like that)
Do it, do it (Stuff like that)
Do it, do it (Stuff like that)

Stuff like that
Stuff like that
What makes you feel like doin' stuff like that?
What makes you feel like doin' stuff like that?
What makes you feel like doin' stuff like that?
What makes you feel like doin' stuff like that?

I can't tell you, what I saw
Made you wonder was it against the law
It was not how high you could you go
But exactly how low

What makes you feel like doin' stuff like that?
What makes you feel like doin' stuff like that?
(All of a sudden, I didn't care)
