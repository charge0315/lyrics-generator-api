Now Vince was a loner, a lovable stoner, ah-ah
He lived in a Bluebird, spelled his name backward, ah-ah
He's so pretty, he always looks shitty, ah-ah
Born on a Monday, such a very good day, ah-ah

And I haven't seen a pupil in his eyes for sixteen days
The Catholic girls love him in a hundred million different ways
And he's been up for days, in a thick malaise
He's only listening to the salad days

A-rock-a-honey, rock-a-honey, woo-hoo
Sleeps all day and he dreams of you
A-rock-a-honey, rock-a-honey, wee-hee
Died in the city where the girls run free, oh

Now Vince got a big crush on the girl from Redrush, ah-ah
He took her out for tacos, said she liked burritos, ah-ah
And he said she's so easy, brought up in the country, ah-ah
She gets naked for a living, she ain't afraid of giving, ah-ah

And I haven't seen a pupil in his eyes for sixteen days
Ah, the Catholic girls love him in a hundred million different ways
And he's been up for days, in a thick malaise
He's only listening to the salad days

A-rock-a-honey, rock-a-honey, woo-hoo
Sleeps all day and he dreams of you
A-rock-a-honey, rock-a-honey, wee-hee
Died in the city where the girls run free

Shhh...
Oh!
Woo!

And I haven't seen a pupil in his eyes for sixteen days
Ah, the Catholic girls love him in a hundred million different ways
And he's been up for days, in a thick malaise
He's only listening to the salad days

A-rock-a-honey, rock-a-honey, woo-hoo
Sleeps all day and he dreams of you
A-rock-a-honey, rock-a-honey, wee-hee
Died in the city where the girls run free

A-rock-a-honey, rock-a-honey, woo-hoo
Sleeps all day, and dreams of you
A-rock-a-honey, rock-a-honey, woo-hoo!
He don't touch titties and he don't touch me, don't touch me, don't touch me
