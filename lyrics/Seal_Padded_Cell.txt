I live my life, I’m a trusted man
Many people confuse me
But I’m a very good hand
I’m a real estate and you can live on me
Always there when you need me
Anybody can see
Even though my flows
Like swallowing a ball of hair
I spit the words i need to hear
I'm in a padded cell
I'm in a padded cell
I'm a million different people
Living inside of me
(living inside of me inside of me)
(living inside of me inside of me)
Oh yeah
(living inside of me inside of me)
I'm a million different people
Living inside of me
I live my life in the attic room
It's one hundred and fifteen
But I can hold my cool
While the people downstairs
They all depend on me
Always there when they need me
But you know it ‘ain't easy
I must admit that I have thought about the other way
But I live and fight another day

Inside my padded cell
(The devil in me, I live my life)
I’m in a padded cell
(The angel in me, I live my life)
Im a million different people
Living inside of me
(living inside of me inside of me)
(living inside of me inside of me)
I'm a million different people
Living inside of me
(living inside of me inside of me)
(living inside of me inside of me)
Don’t think that i don’t question every single voice inside of me everyday
I can’t bare to look at my reflection
He’s staring upside down
But with every story theres an ending
We fly eventually
It’s the only way that I make sense of it
To curl the way the back round
There’s a million different people
Living inside of me
There’s a million different people
Living inside of me
There’s a million different people
Living inside of me
Living inside of me
