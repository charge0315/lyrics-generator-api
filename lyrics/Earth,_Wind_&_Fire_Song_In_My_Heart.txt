I've got a song in my heart
And a feeling just for you
So good that we can't tear apart
A love that's positively true
Can't stop these feelings I got
That I've been trying to get through
I've got a song in my heart
And a feeling just for you

Oh, it's time that we show
Just what one means to the other
Take my hand, and you'll know
We got a whole world to discover

Oh, I, I've got a song in my heart
And a feeling just for you
I've got a song in my heart
And a feeling

Once in a lifetime you feel
This ringing in the air
Something delightful and real
It has something we can share
Now that we've started a spark
There's a light that's peeping through
I've got a song in my heart
And a feeling just for you

Smile, love will show
A wonderful blessing for believers
And what you're giving me
I'm giving right back, right back to you
Try giving up
Planting a reason for deceiving
Love, it gives a touch
And love is pleasing and receiving

Oh, I, I've got a song in my heart
And a feeling just for you
I've got a song in my heart
And a feeling, feeling

Once in a lifetime you feel
This ringing in the air
Something delightful and real
It has something we can share
Now that we've started a spark
There's a light that's peeping through
I've got a song in my heart
And a feeling just for you

Smile, love will show
A wonderful blessing for believers
And what you're giving me
I'm giving right back, right back to you

I've got a song in my heart
And a feeling
I've got a song in my heart
And a feeling
