Oh-ho, if I could do it all over again
Oh-ho-ho, I'd be in the same skin I'm in
The clothes I wear, and the things they dare me to do
Oh, the places I go
Oh-ho, people I know
The things I gain, ooh, sometimes they rain on me
Hey, skin I'm in
Hey, and the things I never never win
Hey, well well well
Hey hey...
