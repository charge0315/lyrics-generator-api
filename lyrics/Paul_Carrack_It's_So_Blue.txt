Down the stairs
The basement door
Where the two of us
Have met before
Orange sheets
Orange phone
Purple pillow
We're all alone
In the heat
Of the afternoon
On your sheets
In your room
It's so blue
This afternoon
I'll come to you
I'll be there soon
It`s so blue
In this afternoon
I'll come to you
I'll be there soon
Another time
Another place
Another smile
On another face
Different story
Different name
Make believe
But it's not the same
In the heat
Of the afternoon
On your sheets
In your room
It's so blue
This afternoon
I'll come to you
I'll be there soon
It`s so blue
In this afternoon
I'll come to you
I'll be there soon
I'll be there soon
Yes I will
Yeah... Oh Yeah
It`s so blue
In this afternoon
I'll come to you
I'll be there soon
It`s so blue
In this afternoon
I'll come to you (Yes I am)
I'll be there soon
It`s so blue
In this afternoon
I'll come to you
I'll be there soon
