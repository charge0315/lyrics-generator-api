You’re one of the lights
Still shining through
Giving so much more than you take
That’s what you do
While you carry that heavy load
And everyone around you knows
But you don’t know how wonderful you are
You make the world a better place
With your kindness
And your grace
You make the world a better place to be
I can’t deny
I can’t deny
That it’s a hard world
For some it is a dark world
But there are a billion lights shining
Oh, don’t stop shining
You make the world a better place
With your kindness
And your grace
You make the world a better place to be
‘Cause what is it worth
If we’re not being kind?
You do so much that nobody sees
Moving quietly behind the scenes
But you don’t have to do anything to prove
That you make the world a better place
With your kindness
And your grace
You make the world a better place to be
All I know
Is that if we all could just stick together
We can make it through
This storm
Of indifference, violence and greed
‘Cause what is it worth
If we’re not being kind to anyone?
What’s it all worth
If we haven’t got time for anyone?
