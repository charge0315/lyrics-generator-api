We sat on a roof, named every star
Shared every bruise and showed every scar
Hope has its proof, your hand in mine, singin'
"Life has a beautiful, crazy design"

And time seemed to say
"Forget the world and its weight"
And here I just wanna stay
Amazing day, amazing day

We sat on a roof, named every star
Showed me a place where you can be who you are

And the view; the whole Milky Way
In your eyes, I drifted away
And in your arms, I just wanna sway
Amazing day, amazing day
Amazing day, amazing day

Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oooh

And I asked
Can the birds in poetry chime?
"Can there be breaks in the chaos sometimes?"
Oh, thanks God, must have heard when I prayed
'Cause now I always want to feel this way

Amazing day, amazing day
Amazing day, amazing day
Yeah, today
