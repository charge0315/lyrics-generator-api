She came from a world that was so far out
Roller skating into my life, I never had no doubt (do-do-do-do-do-do, do-do-do)
She said, "Where'd you get that velvet-colored hair?"
I said, "I got lot's more somewhere
If you touch my big-" (do-do-do-do-do-do, do-do-do)
And she said, "I come from a world that is so far out" (do-do-do-do-do-do)
And I said, "So do I"

And she may not be the world's solution
But she's a world-class revolution
