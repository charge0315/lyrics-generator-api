I walk along
The streets we used to walk
On a moonlit night together
How could such bliss
End up like this
I eat alone
At a table meant for two
And I miss the conversation
Now that you've gone away

There's no sleep for hearts that break
If like me you lay awake
That's the risk that people take
Saying it's over

When I get home
Well I pour myself a drink
From an almost empty bottle
Downing it fast
Drowning the past
I hear the phone
And I almost hesitate
'Cause it might be you that's callin'
Saying you're still awake

Do you miss the times we've spent
Wishing you could change events
Then I guess it made no sense
Saying it's over
We've got to be crazy to ever let
Love slip through our hands
Are we living to regret
Saying it's over

Do you miss the times we've spent
Wishing you could change events
Guess we never made much sense
Saying it's over

Saying it's over
Saying it's over, girl
Saying it's over now
Saying it's over
Saying...
