"Radio"
Something she's keeping from me I'm not dumb
Don't give a damn
Three's not a crowd I'm a man I'm a man
She likes boys, she likes girls
Twists her little fingers round those, supernatural curls
There's a spider in her eyes
Something she can't disguise
From me
Two heavy whispers from her, blackened lips
Was all it took to get a touch...
Now she's gone
Left alone lone like a loaded gun
I see you soon
Let's have some fun (let's get it on)
I have a reefer and some spanish cigarettes
And on the back was written her address
Call me up
Try me on tune me in
Let's make a supernova
Let's make another naked lightshow
Let's get it on the radio
You took me last night and you weren't alone
Let's get it on the radio
You're making love to me (in stereo)
Let's do some crazy shit tonight
You guys have got the only tune I like
So let's get it on the radio
(Just do it to me give it to me making love in stereo)
Well you come unstuck when you get misinformation (don't drop me now, how high)
You droped my lever and I lost this elevation (baby I was so high drop me out of your sky)
Oh baby you're wrong (all night)
You were making love to me in stereo
Can't you see there's nothing wrong (all night)
I know you wanna get it on the radio
That's when
Some funny-money funny business going on
Something she's keeping from me I'm not dumb, don't give a damn
Well three's not a crowd
I'm a man, I'm a man
She likes boys, she likes girls
Twists her little fingers round those supernatural curls
There's a spider in her eyes
Something she can't disguise
That girl, oh she's making love in stereo
So let's get it on the radio
You took me last night and you weren't alone
So let's get it on the radio
You're making love to me (in stereo)
Let's sneak it on the midnight news
You liked it once but now you work in twos
So let's get it on the radio
(Just do it to me give it to me making love in stereo)
All night (baby) all night all night
Let's get it on
All night all night (all night)
Let's just get it on
Hey I know all along
You were making love to me in stereo
I can see there's nothing wrong
I know you wanna get it on the radio
Oh let's get it on (all night all night)
Let's just get it on
(I always play your tune on the radio)
All night all night all night
Let's get it on
All I know
You're making love to me
You're making love to me
Stereo
Oh baby, I play it on the radio, play it on the radio
Let's get it on
Something she's keeping from me I'm not dumb
I don't give a damn
Three's not a crowd
I'm a man, I'm a man
