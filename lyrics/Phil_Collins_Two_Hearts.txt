Well, there was no reason to believe
She'd always be there
But if you don't put faith in what you believe in
It's getting you nowhere

'Cause it hurts, you never let go (Ooh)
Don't look down, just look up
'Cause she's always there behind you (Ooh)
Just to remind you

Two hearts
Living in just one mind
You know we're two hearts
Living in just one mind

Well, there's no easy way to
To understand it
There's so much of my life in her
And it's like I'm blinded

And it teaches you to never let go (Ooh)
There's so much love you'll never know
She can reach you no matter how far (Ooh)
Wherever you are

Two hearts
Living in just one mind
Beating together
Till the end of time
You know we're two hearts
Living in just one mind
Together forever
Till the end of time, oh

She knows (She knows)
There will always be a special place
In my heart for her (Ooh)
She knows, she knows, she knows
Yeah, she knows (She knows)
No matter how far apart we are (Ooh)
She knows I'm always right there beside her (Ooh)

We are two hearts
Believing in just one mind
Beating together
Until the end of time
You know we're two hearts
Believing in just one mind (Believing in just one mind)
Together forever (Together forever)
Till the end of time
You know we're two hearts
Believing in just one mind (Believing in just one mind)
Just one mind, just one mind (Together forever)
Till the end of times
Two hearts, two hearts
Believing, believing, just one mind
Beating together (Together forever)
Till the end of time
Till the end of time, two hearts
