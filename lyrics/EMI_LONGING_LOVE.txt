I wasn't looking for love
Wasn't looking for love, wasn't looking for love
I wasn't looking for love
Wasn't looking for love, wasn't looking for love

I wasn't looking for something, I wasn't looking for love
I feel like everyone's rushin'
But I'm not one to judge

I've been addicted to sparkling things
Yeah, I like the way you shine
And I'm not that good at the inbetween shit
So sometimes I'm outta line

I wasn't looking for love
Wasn't looking for love, wasn't looking for love
I wasn't looking for love
Wasn't looking for love, wasn't looking for love
I was looking for attention, someone to hold at night, yeah
Who knows how to do it right
I wasn't looking for love
Wasn't looking for love, wasn't looking for love

Come and lay your body right on top of me
Hold me like you nеver get enough of mе
I wonder why we only do this casually
'Cause actually, it is distracting me (Yeah)

I've been addicted to sparkling things
Yeah, I like the way you shine
And I'm not that good at the inbetween shit
So sometimes I'm outta line

I wasn't looking for love
Wasn't looking for love, wasn't looking for love
I wasn't looking for love
Wasn't looking for love, wasn't looking for love
I was looking for attention, someone to hold at night, yeah
Who knows how to do it right
I wasn't looking for love
Wasn't looking for love, wasn't looking for love

I always get like this, yeah
There's always something that I miss
And I go, oh, I wanna get it like this
But there's always something that I miss

I wasn't looking for love
Wasn't looking for love, wasn't looking for love
I wasn't looking for love
Wasn't looking for love, wasn't looking for love
I was looking for attention, someone to hold at night, yeah
Who knows how to do it right
I wasn't looking for love
Wasn't looking for love, wasn't looking for love
