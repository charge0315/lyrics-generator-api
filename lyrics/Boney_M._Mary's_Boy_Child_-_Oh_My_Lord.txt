Mary's boy child Jesus Christ
Was born on Christmas day
And man will live forever more
Because of Christmas day

Long time ago in Bethlehem
So the Holy Bible said
Mary's boy child Jesus Christ
Was born on Christmas day

Hark, now hear the angels sing
A king was born today
And man will live forever more
Because of Christmas day
Mary's boy child Jesus christ
Was born on Christmas day

While shepherds watch their flocks by night
They see a bright new shining star
They hear a choir sing a song
The music seemed to come from afar

Hark, now hear the angels sing
A king was born today
And man will live forever more
Because of Christmas day

Mm-mm, mm-mm
Mm-mm-mm, mm-mm
Mm-mm-mm, mm-mm-mm
Mm-mm-mm, mm-mm
Mm-mm-mm, mm-mm-mm
Mm-mm-mm, mm-mm
Mm-mm-mm, mm-mm
Mm-mm-mm, mm-mm

For a moment the world was aglow
All the bells rang out, there were tears of joy and laughter
People shouted, "Let everyone know
There is hope for all to find peace"

Now Joseph and his wife, Mary
Came to Bethlehem that night
They found no place to bear her child
Not a single room was in sight
And then they found a little nook
In a stable all forlorn
And in a manger, cold and dark
Mary's little boy was born

Hark, now hear the angels sing
A king was born today
And man will live for evermore
Because of Christmas day
Mary's boy child Jesus Christ
Was born on Christmas day

Oh, a moment the world was aglow
All the bells rang out, there were tears of joy and laughter
People shouted, "Let everyone know
There is hope for all to find peace"

Oh, my Lord, you sent your son to save us
Oh, my Lord, your very self you gave us
Oh, my Lord, that sin may not enslave us
And love may reign once more
Oh, my Lord, when in the crib they found him
Oh, my Lord, a golden halo crowned him
Oh, my Lord, they gathered all around him
To see him and adore
Oh, my lord, with the child's adoration
Oh, my Lord, there came great jubilation
Oh, my Lord, and full of admiration
They realized what they had (Until the sun falls from the sky)
Oh, my Lord, they had become to doubt you (So praise the lord)
Oh, my Lord, what did they know about you? (He is the truth forever)
Oh, my Lord, but they were lost without you (So praise the lord)
They needed you so bad (His light is shining on us)
Oh, my lord, with the child's adoration (So praise the lord)
Oh, my Lord, there came great jubilation (He is a jubilation)
Oh, my Lord, and full of admiration (So praise the lord)
They realized what they had (Until the sun falls from the sky)
Oh, my Lord, you sent your son to save us (
Oh, praise the lord
)
Oh, my Lord, your very self you gave us (This day will live forever)
Oh, my Lord, that sin may not enslave us (So praise the lord)
And love may reign once more
