Did you take it?

Talking away
I don't know what I'm to say
I'll say it anyway
Today's another day to find you
Shying away
I'll be coming for your love, okay?

Take on me
Take me on
I'll be gone
In a day or two

So needless to say
I'm odds and ends
That's me stumbling away
Slowly learning that life is okay
Say after me
It's no better to be safe than sorry

Take on me
Take me on
I'll be gone
In a day or two

All things that you say
Is it life or just to play my worries away?
You're all the things I forgot to remember
You're shying away
I'll be coming for your love, okay?

Take on me
Take me on
I'll be gone
In a day
