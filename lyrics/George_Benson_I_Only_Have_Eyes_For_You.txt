Are the stars out tonight?
I don't know if it's cloudy or bright
'Cause I only have eyes for you, dear
The moon may be high
But I can't see a thing in the sky
'Cause I only have eyes for you
I don't know if were in a garden
Or on a crowded avenue
You are here, so am I
Maybe millions of people go by
But they all disappear from view
'Cause I only have eyes for you
I don't know if were in a garden
Or on a crowded avenue
You are here and so am I
Maybe millions of people go by
But they all disappear from view
'Cause I only have eyes, I only have eyes
I only have eyes for you
