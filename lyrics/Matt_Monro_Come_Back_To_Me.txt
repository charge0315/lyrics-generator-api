Hear my voice
Where you are
Take a train
Steal a car
Hop a freight
Grab a star
Come back to me
Catch a flame
Catch a breeze
On your hands
On your knees
Swim or Fly
Only please Come back to me
On a mule
In a jet
With your hair in a net
In a towel wringing wet
I don’t care
This is where you should be
From the hills
From the shore
Ride the wind to my door
Turn the highway to dust
Break the law if you must
Move the world only just
Come back to me
Blast your hide
Hear me call
Must I fight city hall
Here and now
Darn it all
Come back to me
What on earth must I do
Scream and yell till I’m blue
Curse your soul
When will you come back to me
Have you gone to the moon
Or the corner saloon
And to rack and to ruin Mademoiselle
Where on earth can you be
In a crate
In a trunk
On a horse
Or on a drunk
In a Rolls or a van
Wrapped in mink or saran
Any way that you can
Come back to me
Come back To me
Come back to me
Come Back to me
Come back to me
