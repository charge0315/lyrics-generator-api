Come on, people
Come on, children
Come on down to
The glory river
Gonna wash you up
And wash you down
Gonna lay the devil down
Gonna lay that devil down
Come on, people
Come on, children
There's a king
At the glory river
And the precious king
He loved the people to sing
Babes in the blinking sun
Sang We Shall Overcome
I got fury in my soul
Fury's gonna take me
To the glory goal
In my mind I can't
Study war no more
Save the people
Save the children
Save the country
Save the country
Come on, people
Come on, children
Come on down to
The glory river
Gonna wash you up
And wash you down
Gonna lay the devil down
Gonna lay that devil down
Come on, people
Sons and mothers
Keep the dream of
The two young brothers
Take that dream
And ride that dove
We could build the dream
With love, I know
We could build the dream
With love, I know
We could build the dream
With love, I know
We could build the dream
With love, I know
We could build the dream
With love, I know
We could build the
Dream with love
I got fury in my soul
Fury's gonna take me
To the glory goal
In my mind I can't
Study war no more
Save the people
Save the children
Save the country
Save the country
Save the country now
