Did she need a stronger hand?
Did she need a lighter touch?
Was I soft or was I tough?
Did I give enough, did I give too much?
At the moment that she needed me
Did I ever turn away?
Would I be there when she called
If she walked into my life today?
Did she mind the lonely nights?
Did she count the empty days?
Was I silent, was I cold?
Was I quick to scold was I slow to praise?
And there must have a been a million things
That my heart to forgot to say
Would I think of one or two
If she walked into my life today?
Would I blame the times I pampered her
Or blame the times that I lost her?
What a shame, I never really found the girl
Before I lost her
Were the years a little fast?
Was her world a little free?
Was there too much of a crowd
All too lush and loud and not enough of me?
Though I'll ask my whole life through
What went wrong along the way
Would I make the same mistakes
If she walked into my life today?
