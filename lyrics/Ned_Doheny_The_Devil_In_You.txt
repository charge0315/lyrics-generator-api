You say you love me
But how am I to know?
You say you'll meet me
But what if you don't show?
It's the devil in you
It's the treasure in your soul
Let me be there with you
When the good times start to roll
It's the devil in you
Love can wash your sins away
What have you got to lose?
If someone should ask you
What would you say?
When in doubt, jump and shout
Keepin' it simple, makin' it pay
Who really knows you deep down inside?
How can you hope to explain?
It's the devil in you
It's the treasure in your soul
Let me be there with you
When the good times start to roll
It's the devil in you
Love can wash your sins away
What have you got to lose?
You say you love me
But how am I to know?
You say you'll meet me
But what if you don't show?
It's the devil in you
It's the treasure in your soul
Let me be there with you
When the good times start to roll
It's the devil in you
It's the devil in you
It's the devil in you, whoa
It's the devil in you
