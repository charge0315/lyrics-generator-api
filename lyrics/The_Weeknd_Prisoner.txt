You bring good to my lonely life, honestly (Honestly)
It's hard for me to look into your eyes when I say (I say)
That I would be nothing without your love ('Out your love)
I feel the rush and it's amazing

Maybe I've been always destined to end up in this place (Up in this place), yeah
I don't mean to come off selfish, but I want it all (Want it all)
Love will always be a lesson, let's get out of its way (Out of its way)
'Cause I know, all I know (Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah), all I know

I'm a prisoner to my addiction
I'm addicted to a life that's so empty and so cold
I'm a prisoner to my decisions
Woo-ooh, woo-ooh, woo-ooh (Ahh)

I think I've been in Hollywood for too long (
For too long
)
'Cause I can feel my soul burning, feel it burning slow
But I would be nothing without the touch (
'Out the touch
)
I feel the rush and it's amazing, hmm

Maybe I've been always destined to end up in this place (Ahh)
I don't mean to come off selfish, but I want it all (
Want it all
)
Love will always be a lesson, let's get out of its way (
Out of its way
)
'Cause I know, all I know (
Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah
), all I know

I'm a prisoner to my addiction
I'm addicted to a life that's so empty and so cold
I'm a prisoner to my decisions
Woo-ooh, woo-ooh, woo-ooh (
Ohh
)
I'm a prisoner to my addiction (
Prisoner to my addiction, oh
)
I'm addicted to a life that's so empty and so cold (
Empty and so cold
)
I'm a prisoner to my decisions (
Prisoner
)
Woo-ooh, woo-ooh, woo-ooh

I don't know
I get so wrapped up in a world where nothing's as it seems
And real life is stranger than my dreams
Hmm-hmm
Hmm-mm
