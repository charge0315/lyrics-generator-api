Have you gone astray
Or lost your way?
You should have seen me yesterday
Well I knew this kind of love
Was written in the stars
It's only once or twice that you're in line with Mr Moon
Then it was you
You took me on your cloud
And give me flowers for my pain
But with some degree of certainty
My destiny
Seemed to slip away from me
Before I got to know your name
Oh honey
Just give me a chance
I'll do what you want me to
Everybody wants to dance
So how come I can't dance with you?
You really turn me on
You're the one that makes me smile
It's Mr Moon who plays in tune, Mr Moon who knows
And if it's Mr Moon who gives the sign, then that's the sign that goes
I never know what to do
'Til I'm there with you
Did you lose your mind
For a day?
You don't remember anyway
Like the waters of a dream
Encapsulate my mind
A place I haven't seen sits at the end of space and time
So lost in love
That I think I'm blind
To perchance upon this circumstance is something of a miracle
So spiritual
It's verging on the physical
Searching for a love I cannot find
Now I'm lost in your love
Now I'm lost with Mr Moon
And I don't know where to turn
Now I'm lost in your love
Now I'm lost in your love
Just play my tune
Just give me a chance
I'll do what you want me to
Everybody wants to dance
So how come I can't dance with you?
You really turn me on
You're the one that makes me smile, yeah
It's Mr Moon who plays in tune, Mr Moon who knows
And if it's Mr Moon who gives the sign, then that's the sign that goes
I never know what to do
'Til I'm there with you
I'm Mr Moon
Play that tune for me, yeah
Oh, Mr Moon, just play that tune for me
Why don't you play that tune
Then I can get down
Then I can get down with this girl
