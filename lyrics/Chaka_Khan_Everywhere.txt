Can't you hear me calling out your name?
You know I'm falling and I don't know what to say
I'll speak a little louder, I'll even shout
You know I'm proud and I couldn't get the words out

Oh I (I, I) I want to be with you everywhere
Oh I (I, I) I want to be with you everywhere
I wanna be with you everywhere (Wanna be with you everywhere)

Something's happening, happening to me
My friends all say I'm acting peculiarly
C'mon baby, you better make a start
You better do it soon before you break my heart

(I, I) I want to be with you everywhere
I (I, I) I want to be with you everywhere
I wanna be with you everywhere
Oh I (I, I) I want to be with you everywhere
I (I, I) I want to be with you everywhere
I wanna be with you everywhere (Wanna be with you everywhere)

Everywhere (I wanna, I wanna, I wanna, I wanna)
Everywhere (I wanna, I wanna, I wanna, I wanna)
Everywhere (I wanna, I wanna, I wanna, I wanna)

(I, i)
(I, i)
(I, i)

(I wanna be with you ever here)
I (I, I) I want to be with you everywhere
I (I, I) I want to be with you everywhere

I wanna be, I wanna be, I wanna be, I...
(If you take me with you)
I wanna be, I wanna be, I wanna be...
(I'll go wherever you go, yeah)
I wanna be, I wanna be, I wanna be, I...
(Owww, baby)
I wanna be, I wanna be, I wanna be...
(Uh huh...)
(I, I)
Oh I (I, I) I want to be with you everywhere
Oh I (I, I) I want to be with you everywhere
I wanna be, I wanna be, I wanna be, I...
I wanna be, I wanna be, I wanna be, baby baby
I wanna be with you
I wanna be with you
Did you hear me say? I...
Oh I (I, I) I want to be with you everywhere
I wanna be, I wanna be, I wanna be, I...
I wanna be, I wanna be, I wanna be, baby baby
I wanna be with you
I wanna be with you
I wanna be with you everywhere
