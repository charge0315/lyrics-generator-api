I live in the Merchant City, drive a four-by-four
Oh, I eat M&S, it tastes of nothing
Oh, I taste of nothing
I am the new Scottish gentry
An Anglified vowel, sub-London thoughts
I am the new Scottish gentry
An Anglified vowel, sub-London thoughts, oh

So I'm shopping, shopping for blood
Oh, I'm shopping, I'm shopping for blood
So I'm shopping, shopping for blood
Oh, I'm shopping, I'm shopping for—

So it's leather for leisure, velcro for sport
Oh, it's a first appearance and a new suit at court
Oh, it's leather for leisure, velcro for sport
It's a first appearance and a new suit at court

Hi, there!
I agree (Shopping for blood)
Oh, hi, there! (I'm shopping)
Oh, I can only agree (Shopping for blood)

I am the new Scottish gentry
An Anglified vowel, sub-London thoughts
I am the new Scottish gentry
An Anglified vowel, sub-media thoughts

So I'm shopping, shopping for blood
Oh, I'm shopping, I'm shopping for blood
So I'm shopping, shopping for blood
Oh, I'm shopping, I'm shopping for—

So it's leather for leisure, velcro for sport
It's a first appearance and a new suit at court
It's leather for leisure, velcro for sport
It's a first appearance and a new suit at court
