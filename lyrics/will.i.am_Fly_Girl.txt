I don't want nobody, I don't want nobody
I don't want nobody, nobody but you, babe
I don't want nobody, I don't want nobody
I don't want nobody but you

It's all so clear, clear to me now
It gotta be your class, your style, and your smile
The sun ain't shinin', shinin' when you gone
All I get is rains, all I get is storms
'Cause it's nothin' I could do, and nothin' I could say
'Cause I know coulda, woulda, shoulda asked you to stay
Steal me for life, make you my wife
But my ego had me blinded and I couldn't see the light
Love is complicated only when you fight it
Love is at its greatest when you touchin' like Midas
And it's that simple, simple as can be
I'm the only one for you, you the only one for me
Now, you see it takes two, two time's the charm
And this time around we gon' form a strong bond
And together we could soar, soar to whatever
And I'll never leave you never 'cause forever is forever

Pretty girls that be comin' around
I wanna let you know, I be turnin' them down
'Cause I don't want no other ladies
Tellin' me they love me
Pretty girls that be comin' around
I wanna let you know, I be turnin' them down
'Cause I don't want no other ladies
Tellin' me they love me
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy
I don't want nobody, I don't want nobody
I don't want nobody, nobody but you, babe
I don't want nobody, I don't want nobody
I don't want nobody but you

Baby, you a fly girl (Fly girl)
Fly girl (Fly girl), fly girl (Fly girl)
I want you to be my girl (My girl)
My girl (My girl), my girl (My girl)
Ooh yeah, baby, you a fly girl (Fly girl)
Fly girl (Fly girl), fly girl (Fly girl)
I want you to be my girl (My girl)
My girl, girl, girl, girl, girl

I'll be reminiscin', think about the moments
We spend alone for hours while we sittin', talkin', holdin'
Connected conversations infectin' our relation
Our chemistry will bubble up that tingling sensation
You're teasin', blowin' me kisses, I play and call you missus
I missed the way you hug me when you're whisperin' your wishes
I never meant to hurt you, I hope you know I'm sorry
Together we could bring a happy endin' to the story
All we need is trust, just another chance
A little bit of luck in romance to advance
I'll be your knight in shinin', you'll be my silver linin'
A good relationship is precious like a diamond
And I'll never let you go
And I wanna let you know that I'm open up to grow
And together we could flow, flow to whatever
And I never leave you never 'cause forever is forever

Pretty girls that be comin' around
I wanna let you know, I be turnin' them down
'Cause I don't want no other ladies
Tellin' me they love me
Pretty girls that be comin' around
I wanna let you know, I be turnin' them down
'Cause I don't want no other ladies
Tellin' me they love me
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy
I don't want nobody, I don't want nobody
I don't want nobody, nobody but you, babe
I don't want nobody, I don't want nobody
I don't want nobody but you

Baby, you a fly girl (Fly girl)
Fly girl (Fly girl), fly girl (Fly girl)

Fly girl (Fly girl), fly girl (Fly girl)
I want you to be my girl (My girl)
My girl, girl, girl, girl, girl
