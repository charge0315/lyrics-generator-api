Nine out of ten mortals agree today
Too much fame causes spiritual decay
Yeah!
Ow!
Ow ow ow!

To all the punks who believe
That life imitates music
No more candy for you
We can't hang with you
To all the punks who want to be rock stars
And do what they do
There's no future for you
That's the life of a fool

No more candy, no more candy for you
We're too funky, and you can't handle our groove
Get it now!

To all the freaks in the magazines
Uh, who never paid no dues
No more candy for you
You can't sing, it's true
To all the freaks walking into walls
Somebody put a spell on you
No more candy for you
I guess the devil got a brand new fool

No more candy, no more candy for you
We're too funky, and you can't handle our groove

No more candy
No more candy
No more candy
No more candy

No more candy, no more candy for you

Look out, sugar
Ooh

No more candy, no more candy for you

To all the haters on the internet
Somebody's looking at you
No more candy for you
They got your number now, fool
To all the suckers winning anything
And thanking the lord for what you do
No more candy for you, no more candy for you

No more candy, no more candy for you
No more candy for you, yeah

No more candy, no more candy for you
I'm too funky, and you can't handle my groove
No more candy, no more candy for you, no more candy for you
