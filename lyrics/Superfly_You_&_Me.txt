I hope you hate me
For showing you I cared so much
I guess it wasn’t fair
You held your breath too long
Too late to open up

I hope you hate me
For telling you that I can’t be your friend
But it’s how it had to end
Don’t ask me how I am again

Is there blood on my hands?
Did I cause you any pain?
Is there blood on my hands?
Did I cause you any pain?

I hope that you hate me
On the phone I didn’t seem upset
It’s probably for the best
I could never hold you
In any event

You did it to yourself
I can’t let you get away
Hurting someone else

Is there blood on your hands?
You caused me so much pain
If there’s blood on your hands
What are you to say?
