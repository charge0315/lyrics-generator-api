Oooh (Magic, magic, magic)
Ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh (Magic, magic, magic, magic)
I love the girl with magic ways

The way you whisper in my ear
To make my troubles disappear
It's magic
The way your little fingertips
Make my heart do double flips
It's magic
And when you smile at me that way
Well, you can warm the coldest day
It's magic
(It's magic, magic)
And even when you're gone I find
I hear you laughing in my mind
It's magic
(It's magic, magic)

And all I have to do is think of you
To make the music start to play
Then I dance down the street
And the people I meet stop and say "Hey, hey"

Magic ways, my friend (Ooh-ooh)
You love the girl with magic ways, and it's true
I might as well give in (Ooh-ooh)
You cast a spell on all my nights and days
With your sweet magic ways

When I go to sleep it seems
You sprinkle stardust in my dreams
It's magic
(It's magic, magic)
And in the morning when I rise
The mockingbirds all harmonize
It's magic
(It's magic, magic)

And when you want me you just clap your hands
And I'll be with you right away
Then we'll float on a breeze
While the leaves in the trees softly say "Hey, hey"

Magic ways, my friend (Ooh-ooh)
You love the girl with magic ways, and it's true
I might as well give in (Ooh-ooh)
You cast a spell on all my nights and days
With your sweet magic ways

(Magic, magic, magic, magic
Uh-ah, ooh-oh
Magic, magic, magic, magic
Uh-ah, ooh-oh)

Magic ways, my friend (Ooh-ooh)
You love the girl with magic ways, and it's true
I might as well give in (Ooh-ooh)
I love the girl with magic ways (I love the girl with magic)
Hey, Hey (I love the girl with magic ways)

Magic ways, my friend (Ooh-ooh)
You love the girl with magic ways, and it's true (Magic, magic)
I might as well give in
You cast a spell on all my nights and days
With your sweet magic-
Ways My friend (Ooh-ooh)
You love the girl with magic ways, and it's true (Magic, magic)
I might as well give in (Ooh-ooh)
I love the girl with magic ways (I love the girl with magic)
Ahhh (I love the girl with magic ways)
Magic ways my friend (Ooh-ooh)
You love the girl with magic ways, and it's true (Magic, magic)
I might as well give in
You cast a spell on all my nights and days
