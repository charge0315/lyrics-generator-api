Ooo
Just like me, they long to be
Close to you
Just like me, they long to be
Close to you

On the day that you were born (Ooo)
And the angels got together (Ooo)
And decided to create a dream come true (Ooo)
So they sprinkled moon dust
In your hair of gold
And starlight in your eyes of blue

Just like me, they long to be
Close to you
Just like me, they long to be
Close to you
