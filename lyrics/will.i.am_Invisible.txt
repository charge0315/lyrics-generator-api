And we try to fix it up but it's too late
Let's give up, had enough, no more mistakes
Here we go, here we go
'Cause you can't see where I'm coming from
I feel so invisible

My lady got me going crazy 'cause
We be having problems and
I think that she ready to go away
Well, she could be happy 'cause
We be steady arguin'
And I can't really take it no more, no no
Too much of fussin' and fightin'
This used to be so excitin'
And now it's just not invitin' no more
Now baby, why even bother if we can't help one another over?

And we try to fix it up but it's too late
Let's give up, had enough, no more mistakes
Here we go, here we go
'Cause you can't see where I'm coming from
I feel so invisible

She can't see me, hey, she can't see me
The girl can't see me, no, she can't see me (I'm invisible)
She can't see me, hey, she can't see me
The girl can't see me, no, she can't, she can't (I'm invisible)

My lady don't even be listening
I be tryna tell her but she said she can't take it no more
Because she can't really handle it
Love is something scandalous
I just let her walk out the door, whatever
Whatever happened to what meant to be
So why don't we simply
Stop playing games mentally? (Games, games, games)
Whatever we did, we did it
Let's hurry up and just get it over

And we try to fix it up but it's too late
Let's give up, had enough, no more mistakes
Here we go, here we go
'Cause you can't see where I'm coming from
I feel so invisible

She can't see me, hey, she can't see me
The girl can't see me, no, she can't see me (I'm invisible)
She can't see me, hey, she can't see me
The girl can't see me, no, she can't, she can't (I'm invisible)

I'm invisible, I'm invisible, I'm invisible
I got no visuals
I be talkin', she be walkin', walkin' with her eyes closed
Tryna get her attention, does she see me? No, she don't
I'm invisible, I'm invisible
I'll be yelling in her face but she don't even notice
I be speakin', she be creepin', creepin' with her eyes closed
Check her out, there she goes, creepin' with her eyes closed

But it's too late
Let's give up, had enough, no more mistakes
Here we go, here we go
'Cause you can't see where I'm coming from
I feel so invisible (I'm invisible)
And we try to fix it up but it's too late
Let's give up, had enough, no more mistakes
Here we go, here we go
'Cause you can't see where I'm coming from
I feel so invisible (I'm invisible)

I'm invisible
I'm invisible
I'm invisible
I'm invisible
