It seems like a good time to tell you my point of view
Just look around and you'll know it's true

All we need
All we need to do is love one another
What we need to do is care for each other
All we need
All we need to do is love one another
All we need, all we need, all we need is love

When love comes along
You've got to give it a try
No you can't, you can't stop
Your life's true desires

All we need to do is love one another
What we need to do is care for each other

All we need

Love will find you some way
You just keep your heart open today
Don't let the love get away
What we're tryin' to say

We've got the space and the time
Let's live life in harmony
'Cause that's the real design
