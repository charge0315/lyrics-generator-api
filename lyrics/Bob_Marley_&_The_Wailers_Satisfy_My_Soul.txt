Oh, please don't you rock my boat (Don't rock my boat)
Because I don't want my boat to be rocking (Don't rock my boat)
Oh, please don't you rock my boat (Don't rock my boat)

I'm telling you that, oh, oh-ooh, wo-o-wo!
I like it - like it like this (I like it like this, I like it like this)
So keep it steady, like this (I like it like this)
And you should know - you should know by now

I like it like this, ooh, yeah! (I like it like this)

Satisfy my soul, You satisfy my soul (Satisfy my soul)

Every little action (Satisfy my soul)
There's a reaction (Satisfy my soul)
Oh, can't you see what you've done for me, oh, yeah
I am happy inside all - all of the time. Wo-oo-o-oo

When we (Bend) bend a new corner
I feel like a (Sweep) sweepstake winner
When I meet you around the corner ('Round the corner)
You make me feel like a sweepstake winner (A sweep - a sweepstake winner)

Whoa, child! Can't you see? You must believe me
Oh, darling, darling, I'm calling, calling
Can't you see? Why won't you believe me
Oh, darling, darling, I'm calling, calling
(Calling, calling, calling, calling)

When I meet you around the corner
Oh, I said, "Baby, never let me be a loner
And then you hold me tight, you make me feel all right
Yes, when you hold me tight, you made me feel all right

Whoa, child! Can't you see? Don't you believe me
Oh darling, darling, I'm calling, calling
Can't you see? Why won't you believe me

(Calling, calling, calling, calling)

Satisfy my soul, that's all I want you to do
That's all I'll take from you, satisfy my soul
