All she does is try to make ends meet
Living day to day economy
Holding strong to all her dignity
Lady luck always takes a back seat
She said
Saturday night, saturday night
One night can make it better
Saturday night, we can all be free
Picking up the pieces
Ready to start a new day

She'll be there every saturday night
Taking it to the floor
Losing all her troubles in a musical high
That's what the weekend's for
Every single one she meets
Moves to the sound of the beat
Until the sun comes up
Knocked down and I'm on the street
She'll stand that city heat
Until she gets to the end of the week

Two kids in the back room
Where they're all sleeping in the same bed
Daddy up and left them
While mama baked them bread
Saturday night, saturday night
One night can make it better
Saturday night, we can all be free
Said she longs to
Go somewhere they won't be staring at me

Look good on a Saturday
Look good on a Saturday
Look good on a Saturday
Look good on a Saturday

Saturday night, Saturday night, Saturday night
Look good on a Saturday
Saturday night, Saturday night, Saturday night
Look good
Saturday night, Saturday night, Saturday night
Feel good on a Saturday
Saturday night, Saturday night, Saturday night
Feel good
