How long 'til you're checked out?
Six or so deep in an hour fifteen
It's getting late, can we go now?
Brown paper bags and a night that I know you'll forget
You'll forget
You'll forget

Watch it all fade
Wait 'til the morning
Fractured bones
Set fire to the throne
The life that want
I had it last night
It's over now
I'm sober now

You don't speak like you used to
12:51 and you're already gone
I reflect you
Calling in sick to the demons you inherited, oh
Again, oh

Watch it all fade
Wait 'til the morning
Fractured bones
Set fire to the throne
The life that want
I had it last night
It's over now
I'm sober now

Comfort in retreat
It's over
Feels cheap
A season of hiding
Lost the footing
Fell beneath

Take your lies
About how you're fine
And then I'll compare them to mine
Got to find a way out
Got to find a way out
Got to find
Got to find
Got to find
Got to find
Got to find a way out
Got to find a way out
