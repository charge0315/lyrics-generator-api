So you think my heart's made of stone
And when you're near me, there's no reaction?
Well, you're wrong
From the tip of my toes
My love for you steadily flows
On and on
And each day you're not here (Day you're not here)
I'm soakin' wet with my tears
Not on the outside, but... inside, strong
I love you, I love you, my baby
(Not on the outside...)
Without you, I can't go on
(But inside...)
(Not on the outside, but, inside, strong)
(Not on the outside, but, inside, strong)
I need you, I need you so badly
(Not on the outside...)
To keep this cold heart warm
(But inside strong)
So when you smile at me
And I don't speak (When you smile and I don't speak...)
It's not that I don't care (Pretty baby, pretty baby...)
But I'm so weak (So weak...)
'Cause from my head to my toes
My love for you steadily grows
Not on the outside
But inside, strong
I love you, I love you, my baby
(Not on the outside...)
Without you, I can't go on
(But inside...)
(Not on the outside, but, inside, strong)
(Not on the outside, but, inside, strong)
I need you, I need you so badly
(Not on the outside...)
To keep this cold heart warm
(But inside strong)
So you think my heart's made of stone?
(So you think my heart's made of stone?)
And when you're near me (Pretty baby, pretty baby...)
There's no reaction? Well... (You're wrong)
You're wrong
'Cause from my head to my toes
My love for you steadily grows
Not on the outside (Outside, baby...)
Not on the outside (Not on the outside, baby)
Not on the outside (Not on the outside, baby!)
Ohhh, but inside, strong (Inside strong)
I want you, I need you, my baby
Not on the outside (Not on the outside, baby)
Not on the outside (Not on the outside, baby)
Not on the outside (Not on the outside, baby!)
Ohhh – inside, strong (Inside strong)
I want you, I need you, my baby
Not on the outside (Not on the outside, baby)
Not on the outside (Not on the outside, baby)
Not on the outside (Not on the outside, baby!)
Ohhh – inside, strong! (Inside strong)
I want you, I need you, my baby
Not on the outside (Not on the outside, baby)
Not on the outside (Not on the outside, baby)
Not on the outside (Not on the outside, baby!)
Woahhh-oh-oh – inside strong! (Inside strong)
I want you, I need you, my baby...
