So sad, but there's nothing that I can do
Things are so bad, forget every word I've spoken to you
Love is when it touches you down inside
Why really are you looking for somewhere to hide?

You've gotta hold back the tears
Soon you will discover
Maybe there could be someone who cares for you
You've gotta hold back the tears
Don't have to say never
Love will come to those who are prepared
To give it back

Time will never be on your side
Listen, it could be your only chance to survive
This love is waiting to call you home
Don't read, you'll ever be on your own

You've gotta hold back the tears
Soon you will discover
Maybe there could be someone who cares for you
You've gotta hold back the tears
Don't have to say never
Love will come to those who are prepared
To give it back

This is all you're ever gonna be
Well, is it all worth while?
There's so much that I want you to see
It could be all worth while

You've gotta hold back the tears
Soon you will discover
Maybe there could be someone who cares for you
You've gotta hold back the tears
Don't have to say never
Love will come to those who are prepared
You've gotta hold back the tears
Soon you will discover
Maybe there could be someone who cares for you
You've gotta hold back the tears
