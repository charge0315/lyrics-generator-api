Oooh-oh
Mmm-oh
Time, time
Oooh-oh
This might seem strange since so much time has passed
And since only one of us still looks the same
Your words, not mine, baby
You're still fine, yes, you are
Like wine, you get better with time
So young and so naïve
That I never once believed
That the memory of you would go through me
Like wind going through the trees
Either you believe, baby
That I could not deceive you
You and I, side by side
Or somewhere in between
I don't know
I don't know if this is a bore
But I just can no longer ignore
This fact so sublime
You get better with time
Anyone who's met you agrees
That no one forgets you, most of all, not me
You can claim you're humble and hide
But when it's true, my dear, it's not pride
No
No, no
A jury of my peers would find me
Guilty of so many crimes
If I chose not to remind you
That you get better with time
Oh, this might seem absurd
To someone so cultured
And to one who would grace any stage
Listen to me now
When the hair that frames that face
Dark brown or silvery lace
What is age but a cage, never mind
You will be blind to not know
That you get better with time
