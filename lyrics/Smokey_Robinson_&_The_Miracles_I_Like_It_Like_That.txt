Clap your hands now everybody
We're gonna have some fun tonight
We're gonna sing, shout, and knock ourselves out
Everything's gonna be alright (Alright)
Now let the bassman start playin'
He's gonna come in right on time
He's gonna add a beat to make you pat your feet
And everything's gonna work out fine (Work out fine)

And we can say I like it like that (I like it like that)
I like it like that (I like it like that)
Oh, that's where it's at and I like it like that

(Woo, come on, yeah, come on, play the song)

Now every a man find yourself a woman
She doesn't have to be a beauty queen
If when she holds you tight, she makes you feel alright
Any man that I've ever seen

Has got to say, I like it like that (I like it like that)
Oh, I like it like that (Oh, I like it like that)
Oh, that, I'm trying to tell you (Oh, that's where it's at)
I'm trying to tell you (That's where it's at)
Yeah (Oh, that's where it's at) and I like it like that

(Now come on, everybody, I want you to sing this one time, come on, say it)
I like it like that (I like it like that)
I like it like that (I like it like that)
I like it like that (I like it like that)
Yeah, yeah (Yeah, woo)

Now I know why my mama taught me to be true
She must've known one day that you would come my way
And I would fall in love with you

And we could say I like it like that (I like it like that)
Oh, I like it like that (Oh, I like it like that)
Oh (Oh, that's where it's at), I'm trying to tell you
(That's where it's at) Yeah
(Oh, that's where it's at) Everybody sing now

(That's where it's at) Yeah
(That's where it's at) Alright
(Oh, that's where it's at, and I like it like that)
One more time now
(That's where it's at) It's alright
(That's where it's at) Yeah
(Oh, that's where it's at, and I like it like that)
