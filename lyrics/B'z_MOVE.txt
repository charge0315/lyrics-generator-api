In my bag , nah I’m in my burkin

Tryna line me with n*kkas im curving (skirt)
B*tches throwing p*ssy , yeah that’s for certain

Bad lil b*tch on her knees h*e (facts)
She gonna do what I say she a freak h*e
Couple haters wanna follow me
Stealing they shine like a robbery
New b*tch said she proud of me
I pull her skirt just to eat on the box
Feins hit my line now I’m feeding the block
Ask me for white I stuffed that in the sock
Tagging my name You gon get your sh*t rocked
Run down on who? Not on my watch
Chasing this money, I’m chasing this dream
Living this lifestyle by any means
My life a movie I’m chasing the scenes
Stay in my way & get hit with this beam b*tch (blatant)
