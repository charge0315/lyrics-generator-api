You bring joy to my life
And I'm so glad that we are together
You're the one (who) lifts me up
You bring sunshine where there's stormy weather
When I think of you
I thank you for your love and understanding
Like a plane you make me fly
You bring our love to a happy (happy, happy) landing
I found out what love's all about
There's one thing I want to show you
I want you to know
You're my (you're my) lady sun (lady sun)
You're my reason for living, and you light up my day
You're my (you're my) lady sun (lady sun)
You're my reason for living, and don't you go away
Don't you ever leave me, don't you never
We have a love shining together
Don't you know it shines like the sun!
Just wanna let you know
The way we love (is) very special to me
And when you touch me
You send a chill, uh huh, right through me
Oh, you're the one that I can trust
Deep down inside I know you won't deceive me
Hope and dreams would disappear into the air
If you should ever leave me
I found out what love's all about
There's one thing I want to show you
I want you to know
You're my (you're my) lady sun (lady sun)
You're my reason for living, and you light up my day
You're my (you're my) lady sun (lady sun)
You're my reason for living, so don't you go away
You're my (you're my) lady sun (lady sun)
You're my reason for living, and you light up my day
Don't you ever leave me, don't you never
We have a love shining together
Don't you know it shines like the sun!
