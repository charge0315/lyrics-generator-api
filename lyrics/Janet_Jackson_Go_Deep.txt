We go deep and we don't get no sleep
'Cause we'll be up all night until the early light
We go deep and we don't get no sleep
'Cause we'll be up all night until the early light

I'm feelin' fine 'cause in time, I'll be out tonight
I'm startin' now, makin' sure I look fine tonight
Call René and Boo, gotta meet them soon
Tell T to call Shawn, I'll be there at one
When we show up all the guys at the club wanna get our backs
We look good in black

We go deep and we don't get no sleep
'Cause we'll be up all night until the early light
We go deep and we don't get no sleep
'Cause we'll be up all night until the early light

I'm feelin' high 'cause I'm outta control tonight
(Feelin' high, don't wanna stop)
He's got me movin', DJ groovin', and I feel way right
(Groovin' I don't wanna stop)
Oh, I'm gettin' freaked from behind
I don't even mind 'cause he's lookin' damn fine
I'll make him mine in time, gotta take him home
When I get him all alone, I'll make him scream and moan
He won't wanna stop

We go deep and we don't get no sleep
'Cause we'll be up all night until the early light
We go deep and we don't get no sleep
'Cause we'll be up all night until the early light
We go deep and we don't get no sleep
'Cause we'll be up all night until the early light
We go deep and we don't get no sleep
'Cause we'll be up all night until the early light

I'm feelin' high tonight
Out of control tonight
I'm feelin' high tonight
I feel high

We go deep and we don't get no sleep
'Cause we'll be up all night until the early light
We go deep and we don't get no sleep
'Cause we'll be up all night until the early light
We go deep and we don't get no sleep
'Cause we'll be up all night until the early light
We go deep and we don't get no sleep
'Cause we'll be up all night until the early light
We go deep and we don't get no sleep
'Cause we'll be up all night until the early light
We go deep and we don't get no sleep
'Cause we'll be up all night until the early light
We go deep and we don't get no sleep
'Cause we'll be up all night until the early light
We go deep and we don't get no sleep
'Cause we'll be up all night until the early light

We go deep
