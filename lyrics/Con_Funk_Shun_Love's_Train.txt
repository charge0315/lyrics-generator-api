Warm night, can't sleep, too hurt, too weak
Gotta call her up
Dial that number, no one answers
'Til it's two o'clock

And if by chance, you let me come over
Out on the street, I want to see you, baby
And if by chance, you let me just hold ya
I'm down on my knee, I wanna please ya, baby, I
(I'll be your righteous lover)

She said "Sugar, honey, darlin'
I really wanna see ya, too
It's just that someone's over, and baby
I really wanna be with you"

But if by chance, you let me just hold ya
I'm calling, I'm free, I wanna see ya, baby
When in need, you said you would be here
And you hold the key
To my very being, baby and I
(I love you, baby)

If you are that special lover
And love keeps you tied to another
That's the way it goes on love's train
Sometimes, heart strings can be broken
But you just have to keep on goin'
That's the way it goes on love's train

On a warm night, lady wants her baby
So, she calls him up
Dial that number, no one answers
'Til it's two o'clock

If by chance, you just come over
'Cause darlin', please, I've got to see ya, baby
And when in need, you said you would be here
And now, I'm in need and please believe me, baby
I love you, darlin'
(Listen, babe)

If you are that special lover
Love keeps you tied to another
That's the way it goes on love's train
(You don't need no, you don't need no ticket to ride)
Sometimes, heart strings can be broken
But you just got to keep on goin'
That's the way it goes on love's train
(Listen, babe, listen, baby)
If deep sorrow, you've been soakin'
But you just have to keep on strokin'
That's the way it goes on love's train
(Love's a hurtin' thang, y'all, it makes you wanna cry, come on)
If you are that special lover
And love keeps you tied to another
That's the way it goes on love's train
(Find yourself alone)
Sometimes, heart strings can be broken
But you just have to keep on flowin'
That's the way it goes on love's train
(In time, everything's gonna be alright)
If deep sorrow, you've been soakin'
But you just have to keep on strokin'
That's the way it goes on love's train
