Turn on the action (Come on and give me your love)
I'm runnin' hot, baby, give me the love inside
(Gotta keep it hot, give it all you got)
Feed me your passion (Come on and make it alright)
Don't waste no time
Baby, show me a dream tonight (Gotta keep me satisfied)
Don't hold it back
Let your love flow through me
I need to feel you in my soul
Like it used to be
Won't you do it to me?
Give me the moments that make me lose control
Got to put back the feeling we knew once before
And I will make you see that it's alright
Pull down the blinds, put the lock on the door
So we can share the magic that comes from being one
And show the world we've only just begun
Turn on the action (Come on and give me your love)
I'm runnin' hot, baby, give me the love inside
(Gotta keep it hot, give it all you got)
Feed me your passion (Come on and make it alright)
Don't waste no time
Baby, show me a dream tonight (Gotta keep me satisfied)
Just treat me right
I'm a winning ticket, come on and take away the prize
It's up to you, now's the time to get it
I'll give you somethin' to make you realize
There's a new kind of woman that's showing her style
I hope that you can make it through the night
So put all your trust in the warmth of my smile
And I will show you heaven
Like no one's seen before
Without a doubt, I'll leave you wantin' more
So take my hand, we'll drift into the night
And I will be your fantasy
And in a while you'll see that only I can set you free
Turn on the action (Come on and give me your love)
I'm runnin' hot, baby, give me the love inside
(Gotta keep it hot, give it all you got)
Feed me your passion (Come on and make it alright)
Don't waste no time
Baby, show me a dream tonight (Gotta keep me satisfied)
Got to put back the feeling we knew once before
And I will make you see that it's alright
Pull down the blinds, put the lock on the door
So we can share the magic that comes from being one
And show the world we've only just begun
Turn on the action (Come on and give me your love)
I'm runnin' hot, baby, give me the love inside
(Gotta keep it hot, give it all you got)
Feed me your passion (Come on and make it alright)
Don't waste no time
