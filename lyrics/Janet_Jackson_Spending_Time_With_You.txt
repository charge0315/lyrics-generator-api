Mmm, I close my eyes and fantasize
And I just imagine a tropical island
We're all alone, our pagers and cell phones cut off
Hot sunny heat, cool ocean breeze
The sand beneath our feet
The crashing waves are like music
Found a place to sleep
Passion fruit to eat
Use all our energy
Under the moonlight making love

I don't think nothing can compare
Nothin' better than
Nothin' better than
Nothin' better than
Spending time with you
Nothin' better than
Nothin' better than
Nothin' better than
Spending time with you

You are my angel, heaven is close
My favorite place is where you are
So we don't have to do nothin' special
Don't wanna run
It's always fun to chill at home
Monday through Friday
Sexy Saturday, easy Sunday
'Cause every day's a special one, just like a holiday
Vacation getaway after the foreplay
Go room to room makin' sweet love

I don't think nothing can compare
Nothin' better than
Nothin' better than
Nothin' better than
Spending time with you (Spending time with you)
Nothin' better than (Yeah, yeah)
Nothin' better than (Ooh, whoa)
Nothin' better than
Spending time, I need time

Morning, noon and night
Yeah just keep it comin', baby
Just keep me comin', baby
I just love it so much, hmm
Spending time with you
That's all I wanna do, hmm
That's all I wanna do (Ooh)

Nothin' better than (Anytime)
Nothin' better than (Or any place)
Nothin' better than (I'm)
Spending time with you
Nothin' better than (As friends)
Nothin' better than (I'm so content)
Nothin' better than ('Cause I'm)
Spending time with you
With my baby, yeah (Oh, with my baby)
Nothin' better than
(I love that, hmm, ohh, God, I just love listening to that)
Nothin' better than
Nothin' better than
Nothin' better than
Spending time with you
That's all I wanna do
That's all I wanna do
That's all I wanna do
That's all I wanna do
