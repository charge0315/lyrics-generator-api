Hey hey hey hey
Have a party night
Disco satellites
Everybody was groovin'
We were movin'
Girl I used to know
I bumped into her right at the door
Groovin'
We were movin'
With just a little time
I'd like to make you mind
I got you on the floor
This time I know
You don't have to go
Don't have to go
Don't have to go
No, no you don't have to go
Hearts will party down
Just dancing with the people around
Groovin'
Everybody was movin'
My girl is so fancy free
Such a face so exciting to me
Get down with me baby
We were moving
Having cheese and wine
Dancing all the time
And I had just turned around
Little fine girl she was just getting down
All the sweet loving
Give me all your sweet loving
All of it, all of it, all your sweet loving
All your sweet loving
Give me all your sweet loving
Give me all your sweet loving
All of it, all of it, all your sweet loving
All your sweet loving
Give me all your sweet loving

Hey hey hey
Hey hey
Hey hey hey
The set had just begun
I looked up and my girl was gone
Get down with me baby
She was moving
The place was in a groove
And really on the move
Dripping on the floor
All I could do was pray for more
Give me all your sweet loving
All of it, all of it, all your sweet loving
All your sweet loving
Give me all your sweet loving
Give me all your sweet loving
All of it, all of it, all your sweet loving
All your sweet loving
Give me all your sweet loving
