Oh, when the going gets tough
That's when the tough get going
Oh, when the going gets tough

That's when the tough get going (don't chicken out, no)
Oh, when the going gets tough (face your enemy)
That's when the tough get going (check it out, yeah, check it out)

I know you're feeling bad
Beware of self-pity
Ain't no time for being sad
Prepare your strategy
Problems won't disappear
No way for you to sleep
Solve them and listen here
Don't turn the other cheek
You'd better get tough, kid

Oh, when the going gets tough
That's when the tough get going
Oh, when the going gets tough
That's when the tough get going

Oh, when the going gets tough (fear nothing)
That's when the tough get going (can't run away, no)
Oh, when the going gets tough (time for some action)
That's when the tough get going (don't hide, uh-uh, don't hide)

How long will you permit
The blues to have its way
It's wrong for you to quit
And choose to let it stay
Inside you know I'm right
Create your destiny
Your pride should make you fight
Take some advice from me
You'd better get tough, kid

When the going gets tough (get tough, get tough)
When the going gets tough
(Get tough, get tough, get tough, get tough)
When the going gets tough (get tough, get tough)
When the going gets tough (get tough)
The tough get going

Why, I remember the time the bad guys had me surrounded
And I got tough!
