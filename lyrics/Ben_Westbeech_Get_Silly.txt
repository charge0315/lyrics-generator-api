Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I keep on rolling round, turning everybody
I keep on rolling round, turning everyone
I get a little bit silly when I've had too many drinks
My attitude is wrong and my breath just really stinks
Please, be careful don't know what you might say
When your friends have run away
We get a little bit silly when I've had too many drinks
Some nasty shit comes out when our minds don't really think
Gotta be careful, don't know what I might say
Gonna get docked down one day
(And it won't be long before)
I keep on rolling round, turning everybody
I keep on rolling round, turning everyone
I just need a little bit of time to sober up
Maybe I will sort it out or maybe I will not
Still get a little bit silly when I have too many drinks
But I don't go mad I just to the brink
Gotta be careful or I will lose my way
Cus I'm easily led astray
I gotta concentrate on the things I really need
Music and love and health my soul needs to be free
Don't need to come down to waste another day
You know I'm gonna be okay
(You know I'll be okay)
I keep on rolling round, turning everybody
I keep on rolling round, turning everyone
