Changes are happening, it's too late to turn back
What you had in mind is turning into something of another kind
Changes are happening all over the place
Feels like you were slapped by a big hand in the face
No need to understand, it's far too late
Just let it go, your only choice is to abdicate
Changes are happening, it's too late to turn back
Changes are happening, the surface begins to crack
What you had in mind is turning into something of another kind
Turning into something of another kind, changes
Remember when you were a kid playing in the yard
No fence was high enough to stop you moving forward
It's the same situation now
Nothing can stop you, just go, go now
Changes are happening, it's too late to turn back
Changes are happening, the surface begins to crack
What you had in mind is turning into something of another kind
Turning into something of another kind, changes
Just dream anything you want to say
Make up the rules for the games you choose to play
Just dream anything you ever want to say
Make up the rules for the games you choose to play
Changes, changes, changes, changes are happening
The truth's right there right in front of your eyes
You can't pretend it was a big surprise
The truth's right there right in front of your eyes
You can't pretend it was a big surprise
The truth's right there right in front of your eyes
You can't pretend it was a big surprise
The truth's right there right in front of your eyes
You can't pretend it was a big surprise
Changes, changes are happening now all over the place
What you had in mind is turning into something of another kind
Turning into something of another kind
Changes, changes are happening now all over the place
What you had in mind is turning into something of another kind
Turning into something of another kind
What you had in mind is turning into something of another kind
