It was just one of those things
Just one of those, crazy things
One of those bells
That now and then rings
Just one of those things
It was just one of those night
Just one of those, fabulous flights
A trip to the moon
On gossamer wings
Just one of those things
If we'd thought a bit of the end of it
When we started painting the town
We'd have been aware that our love affair
Was too hot not to cool down
So goodbye dear and amends
Here's hoping we meet now and then
'cause it was great fun
But it was just one of those things
