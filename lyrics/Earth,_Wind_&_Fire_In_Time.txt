Baby, in time, love is gonna find its way, yeah
Into your life, vanishing your times of gray, yeah
Baby, in time, life reveals its lessons
Maybe in time, you'll learn to count your blessings
In time, you will know it in time
You will know it in time
Baby, in time, your fear is gonna fade away, yeah
We'll march in time to a lovers' hit parade, yeah (In time)
Your face, it shows hope for your sorrow
Baby, in time, there's a new tomorrow, tomorrow
(Hey, hey, hey, hey)
Can somebody tell me why it takes so long to see?
(Hey, hey, hey, hey)
Does anyone know the why of life and its decree
Will somebody tell me why life goes the way it goes?
Somebody may tell, but I don't think nobody knows
Baby, in time, your fear is gonna fade away, yeah
We'll march in time to a lovers' hit parade, yeah
Your face, it shows hope for your sorrow (For your sorrow)
Baby, in time, there's a new tomorrow (Tomorrow)
In time, you will know it in time
You will know it in time
You will know it in time
In time, you will know it in time
You will know it in time
You will know it in time
In time, you will know it in time
You will know it in time
You will know it in time
