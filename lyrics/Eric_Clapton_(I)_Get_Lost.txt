I'm sorry
Why should I say I'm sorry?
If I hurt you
You know you've hurt me too

But you get lost inside your tears
And there is nothing I can do
Because I get lost inside my fear
That I am nothing without you

You're angry
Why shouldn't you be angry?
With what we've been through
Well I get angry too

Why should we have taken so long
To be looking inside of our mind?
Everything we tried went wrong
Are we worried about what we might find?

Because I am nothing without you
And I am nothing without you
Because I am nothing without you
Because I am nothing without you
