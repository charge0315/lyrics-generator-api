Kiss all the pretty ones goodbye
Give every one a penny that cries
You can throw all my Tranquil pills away
Let my blood pressure go on its way

'Cause my autumn's done come
My autumn's done come
Done come

Let those 'I-don't-care-days' begin
I'm tired of holdin' my stomach in
No more slinky Vogue dolls for me
I'll take Sears and Roebuck dolls gladly

'Cause my autumn's done come
My autumn's done come
Done come

Bring me water short and scotch tall
A big long black cigar, that ain't all
Hang me a hammock between two big trees
Leave me alone, dammit, let me do as I please

'Cause my autumn's done come
My autumn's done come
Done come
