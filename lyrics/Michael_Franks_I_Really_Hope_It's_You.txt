Everyone knows that the words of a love song
Are seldom if ever true
Now it's "up periscope"
And I really hope it's you
It's Prince of the Cynics they call me
It's three hundred shades of blue
It's multiple "nope"
But I really hope it's you

I hope it's you
I hope it's you
I hope it's you
I hope it's you

I hope it's you
I hope it's you
I hope it's you
I hope it's you

Got no reason to recommend me
I'm way over twenty-two
Got a strange horoscope
But I really hope it's you

I hope it's you
I hope it's you
I hope it's you
I hope it's you
