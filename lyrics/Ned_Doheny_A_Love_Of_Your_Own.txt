The sooner you give
The sooner you get to have
A love of your own
The longer it takes
The better you come to know
A love of your own
Don't you be afraid
To give your heart
You never know 'til you try it
Don't deny it to yourself
Don't you be afraid to walk right in
(Walk right in)
The door is standing open
You know I'm always hopin'
The sooner you give
The sooner you get to have
A love of your own
As far as you go
You're never too far behind
A love of your own
Don't you be afraid
To shoot the moon
You'll never know 'til you try it
Don't deny it to yourself
Don't you be afraid
To change your tune, oh
The offers always open
You know I'm always hopin'
You know I'm always hopin'
For a love of my own
To shelter me from the cold
A love of my own
A love of my own
The traffic will always bear
A love of my own
A love of your own
You're never too far behind
A love of your own
A love of your own
You're never too far behind
A love of your own
A love of your own
The traffic will always bear
A love of your own
Yeah
A love of your own
You're never too far behind
A love of your own
