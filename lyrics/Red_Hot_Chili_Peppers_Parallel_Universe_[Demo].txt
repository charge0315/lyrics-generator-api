Deep inside of a parallel universe
It's getting harder and harder to tell what came first
Underwater where thoughts can breathe easily
Far away you were made in a sea, just like me
Staring straight up into the sky, oh, my, my
A solar system that fits in your eye, microcosm

Christ, I'm a sidewinder, I'm a California King
I swear it's everywhere, oh, it's everything
Christ, I'm a sidewinder, I'm a California King
I swear it's everywhere, oh, it's everything

, spider web
Take a look at the stars in your head, fields of space kid
Psychic changes are born in your heart, entertain
Nervous breakthrough that makes us the same, blues of hell kid
Kill the pressure that's raining on salty cheeks
When you hear the beloved song, I am with you

Christ, I'm a sidewinder, I'm a California King
I swear it's everywhere, oh, it's everything
Christ, I'm a sidewinder, I'm a California King
I swear it's everywhere, oh, it's everything

Deep inside of a parallel universe
It's getting harder and harder to tell what came first
Underwater where thoughts can breathe easily
Far away you were made in a sea, just like me
Staring straight up into the sky, oh, my, my
A solar system that fits in your eye, microcosm

Christ, I'm a sidewinder, I'm a California King
I swear it's everywhere, oh, it's everything
Christ, I'm a sidewinder, I'm a California King
I swear it's everywhere, oh, it's everything
