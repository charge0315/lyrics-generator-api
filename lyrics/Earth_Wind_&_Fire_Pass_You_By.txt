Don't let love pass you by
Pass you by
Don't let her pass you by
Don't let love pass you by
There's been many of days, and many of nights
I wanted to play in your garden of love
To love you, don't let love
See, but I almost let you slip away
But something tapped me on my shoulder to make me stay (Sun Goddess)
To love you, don't let love, please don't, don't let it pass...
Don't let love pass you by (...you by)
Pass you by (don't let it pass you by)
Don't let her pass you by (don't let her pass you by)
Don't let love pass you by (don't let love)
There ain't much good in any goodbye
Especially when you've fallen in love
You've fallen in love
Well, and the simple things made you feel this way
And simpler things caused those feelings to change
Years from now you'll reach for her, and she'll be gone
Don't let her love pass...
Don't let love pass you by (...you by)
Pass you by (don't let her pass you by)
Don't let her pass you by (don't let her pass you by)
Don't let love pass you by (don't let love pass you by)
Ah, find her in a warm place
Destined love should not be chased
Give her the utmost respect
Tell her she's your superstar
You know good ones are hard to find
Let's put all these thoughts in mind
The one who has always tried to be by your side on cold days
She loves you and cares that you will be forever and ever happy
Chorus and ad lib to fade
