Between the sheets, my mind was tellin' me
Now I see the single life's for me, oh

Never thought I'd be (That's right)
This crazy for you, baby (Uh-huh)
Gotta spell on me (What about it?)
It's voodoo, ooh, come and get me up (Uh-huh)
The way your body moves (That's right)
It drives me, damp, baby (Uh-huh)
Now what I wanna see (If you shake that ass for me so)

Come on, get up, baby
Before you make me change my mind
Come on, get up, ooh, baby
So we can dance all through the night

'Cause you're on my mind all the time
Sexually you give
Mentally, I like your style (Sexually, oh, I like your style)

Never thought I'd be (Yeah)
This crazy for you, baby (Oh, woah)
Gotta spell on me (Well)
It's voodoo, oh, come on get me up
The way your body moves (What about it?)
