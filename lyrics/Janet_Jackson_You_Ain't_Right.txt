(Good evening, ladies and gentlemen)
This one's for the clubs
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Well, I took myself on to the doctor, wasn't feelin' fine
I had a fever 104, oh, that blew my mind
Must be I had enough, 'bout to explode from the gossip, I said
Oh, my friend had my back just to stab, oh, yeah
Hurts so bad when I talk, wanna take something
Numb the pain, I know it ain't right
Come face to face with her
I gotta tell her how I feel inside, woah

Ooh, hoo (Uh)
You ain't right
Ooh, hoo
Sick and tired
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

The doctor said he'd give me something and I'd be alright
I still feel queasy, feel uneasy, no more drugs for me
Friendships I cherish, oh, let very few in the circle, I said
These walls I don't let down, not very easily
Some friends you grow old with
They'll be there until the very end, I do believe that
But not with her like I thought
Let her in and I'll get stabbed again

Ooh, hoo
You ain't right
Ooh, hoo
Sick and tired
Ooh, hoo
You ain't right
Ooh, hoo
Sick and tired
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

This one's for the clubs

Ooh, hoo
You ain't right
Ooh, hoo
Sick and tired
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ooh, hoo
You ain't right
Ooh, hoo
Sick and tired
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
