One day, I may
Find true love that will last forever, and ever
'Til then I'll spend
A lifetime wishing us together
I never thought she'd say goodbye
And I'll never understand
The reasons why

Heart of mine, how will you keep from dying?
Stop reminiscing, who is she kissing?
Heart of mine, oh, what's the use in trying?
No one can mend you now

Love plays cruel games
I can't believe she's found another to love her
Does she miss me? Sometimes I just can't help but wonder
If I could stop the hands of time then I'd know she'd always be forever mine

Heart of mine, how will you keep from dying?
Stop reminiscing, who is she kissing?
Heart of mine, oh, what's the use in trying?
No one can mend you now

Then I'd know she'd always be forever mine
Heart of mine (Oh heart of mine)
How will you keep from dying?
Stop reminiscing, who is she kissing?
Heart of mine (Oh heart of mine)
Oh, what's the use in trying?
No one can mend you now
Oh, heart of mine
Stop reminiscing, who is she kissing?
Heart of mine, oh, what's the use in trying?
No one can mend you now

Oh, heart of mine, oh, heart of mine
Oh, heart of mine
