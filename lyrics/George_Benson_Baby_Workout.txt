Hey, you!
Come out here on the floor
Let's rock some more
Come out here on the floor
Honey, let's rock some more, yeah!
Now when you get out here
Don't you have no fear
Put your hands on your hip
And let your backbone slip
And work out
Oh, my momma, move up
Momma move back
Shuffle to the left
Wobble to the right yeaah
Now it's plain to see
You put a hurtin' on me
Some natural fact
I like it like that
So work out!
Yeah, baby work out
Honey, baby work out!
Ah, baby work out!
Shout and turn the joint out!
Work out!
Work out!
Work all night long!
Oh baby, round and round we go
Where we stop, nobody knows
The band is swinging on the stand
We're moving in, we're moving out
Then we'll step back now and end this dance with a shout
So work out!
…
Baby work out
…
Ah baby work out!
Well baby work out!
Aaah baby work out!
Shout and turn the joint out!
Work out, work out, work all night long!
Aaaah baby now!
Shout and turn the joint out!
Baby work out!
Baby work out yeaah!
Work out, work out, work all night long baby!
Work out!
