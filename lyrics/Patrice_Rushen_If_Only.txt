You took all the hurt away when my heart was down
Showed me I was beautiful and made me smile
Always so dependable
A treasure seldom found
There is much in you to be admired
Now you're wanting happiness to be evermore
And I should be happy and even overjoyed
But my heart is telling me, deep inside I know
Best of friends is as far as we go

If only I could be in love like you want me to
Oh, life would be so fine
If only all the love in your heart for me
Could be here for you in mine

I know how it feels inside to have love unreturned
I know that it seems your love will forever burn
How I wish that I could be the way you were for me
And give you all the things that your heart needs

Oh, if only I could be in love like you want me to
Oh, then your eyes would not cry
If only all the love that you feel for me
I could feel for you inside
Oh, there's nothing I can do
I'm not in love with you

If only I could be in love like you want me to
Oh, life would be so fine
If only all the love in your heart for me
Could be here for you in mine, oh

If only I could be in love like you want me to
Oh, life would be so fine
If only all the love in your heart for me
Could be here for you in mine, oh
If only I could be-
