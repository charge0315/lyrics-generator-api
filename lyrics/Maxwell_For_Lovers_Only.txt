This ain't for the ones
That just love for fun
That just love and run
That just hold the gun

This is for those that bleed
That want but have no need
This ain't for the war
This is only

For lovers only
Lovers only, yeah
Strictly for the lovers only
Who are lost and lonely

Ever since the way that you looked at me
Love is not a want, love is now a need
This is if you want to hold me
Or for lovers only

Not for the easy
This ain't about that style
This about a take it day by day
This about a wait that's worth it, baby

Ever since the way that you look at me (Ever since the way)
Love is not a want, love is now a need (Love is now a need)
Not just 'cause I got nobody (Not just 'cause I got nobody)
This is only (This is only)

For lovers only (Lovers, yeah)
Lovers only, yeah
This is for the lovers only
Who are lost and lonely

Ever since the way that you look at me (The way)
Love is not a want, love is now a need (Now a need)
This is for the lovers only
For lovers only

For lovers only
Lovers only
Lovers only
