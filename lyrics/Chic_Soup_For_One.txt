Soup for one
When you're on the run
When you're by yourself
Minus someone else

Why must I be so depressed?
I feel I'm not like the rest
'Cause I want love to be right
Stay with your darling all night

Soup for one
When you're on the run
When you're by yourself
Minus someone else
Soup for one
When the evening comes
When you're all alone
In your empty home

You have that look in your eye
Just wanted you to be mine, girl
To bathe you in the moonlight
And love you with all my might

Soup for one
When you're on the run
When you're by yourself
Minus someone else
Soup for one
When the evening comes
When you're all alone
In your empty home
Soup for one
When you're on the run
When you're by yourself
Minus someone else
Soup for one
When the evening comes
When you're all alone
In your empty home
Soup for one
When you're on the run
When you're by yourself
Minus someone else
Soup for one
When the evening comes
When you're all alone
In your empty home
