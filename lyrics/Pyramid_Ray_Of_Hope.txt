The style of the scorpion
From the temples of the pyramids
All black  in the northern
Drugs I'm recording
Crystal meth's in my lyrics
They hear it, now they wanna snort it
Heartbreaking asshole
As I strike back, finna crack
After that, I'mma snatch souls
Super Bowl gold
Mind of a pharoah
Son of Ra
Black-winged cape sparrow
Legend of the East Pyramids
Mentally control your whole brain, watch your kids
I am not a member of the human race
I barely even see your face
As the style in my rhymes switch 37 times
My polynice increase to 80 crimes
My voice gets stuck in they head like 40 chimes
I killed Scarface, now the world is mine

It's the Raider Klan and we in this motherfucker like this
You know, the young Klan
The young asshole-minded motherfuckers
Coming through with the motherfucking banger. bitch
And you already know it's me, SGP, the motherfucking young god
Son of Ra, motherfucker
Suck my dick, stupid ass bitch
