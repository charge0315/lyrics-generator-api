I step away
You draw me back
A compromise that I'll despise
The truth concealed by
Royal pretense
My fate is set
I will regret

And all I ever wanted
Was just to be needed
Needed by you

From the day we started
Should have known this love was blighted
'Cause all we ever do is undo

You do your worst
I spit my curse
I bare the scars of your embrace
Oh the pain
Concealed by a love immense
This disconnect I won't forget

And all I ever wanted was just to be needed
Needed by you

From the day we started
Should have known this love was blighted
'Cause all we ever do is undo

The first kiss was an apocolypse
Revealing more than I bargained for
Forbidden fruit
You were never mine
Oh, what was I to do

And all I ever wanted
Was just to be needed
To be needed by you

From the day we started
Should have known this love was blighted
'Cause all we ever do is undo

And all I ever wanted
Was just to be needed
To be needed by you
Yes I did

From the day we started
Should have known this love was blighted
'Cause all we ever do is undo
Oh yeah ah ah
