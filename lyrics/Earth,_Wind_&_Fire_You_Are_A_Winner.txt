Cha-cha-cha-cha, cha-cha-cha-cha, cha-cha-cha
Cha-cha-cha-cha, cha-cha-cha-cha, cha-cha-cha
Cha-cha-cha-cha, cha-cha-cha-cha, cha-cha-cha
Cha-cha-cha-cha, cha-cha-cha-cha, cha-cha-cha
When you're feelin' that you're movin' up
Always someone tryin' to make you stop
When you're filling, fillin' up your cup
Someone comes around to spill every drop
When everything's going strong
And someone doesn't like just what you do
They'll try to make you feel that you're wrong
Pull the rug out from your feet before you're through
If you follow carefully
The flow of your energy
You will start to see
That you are a winner
When you're filling, fillin' up your cup
Someone comes around spill every drop
There is no time for wondering
You're a winner as every day begins
If you follow carefully
The flow of your energy
You will start to see
That you are a winner
You are a winner
Cha-cha-cha-cha, cha-cha-cha-cha, cha-cha-cha
Cha-cha-cha-cha, cha-cha-cha-cha, cha-cha-cha
Cha-cha-cha-cha, cha-cha-cha-cha, cha-cha-cha
Cha-cha-cha-cha, cha-cha-cha-cha, cha-cha-cha
You are a winner
You are a winner
