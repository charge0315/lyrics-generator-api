It's a tricky situation
Hard to say just what the outcome will be
If you solve the riddle you can save your soul
Chase love's shadows 'til the rivers run cold
Hey, baby
Get it up, get it up for love
Get it up, get it up for love
Get it up, get it up for love
There's a longing in the people
No one knows just when the heartache will cease
You can flee in terror, you can stay and fight
You can stand in line and scream, "It's just not right"
Hey, baby
Get it up, get it up for love
Get it up, get it up for love
Get it up, get it up for love
So for a smile, another fallen star
Shadows by the words I haven't said
Don't define
Just what you have in mind
Whoa, whoa, ooh
It's a tricky situation
Heaven knows just where the struggle must end
If it takes forever, I've got time to burn, babe
I won't desert you when the tables turn
Hey, baby
Get it up, get it up for love
Hey, baby
Get it up, get it up for love
Hey, baby (hey, baby)
Get it up, get it up for love
Hey, baby (hey, baby)
Get it up, get it up for love
Hey, baby
Get it up, get it up for love
Hey, baby
