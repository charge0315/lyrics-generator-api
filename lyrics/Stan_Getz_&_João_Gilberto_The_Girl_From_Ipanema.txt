Dim-dum-dum, pling-gung-gung, pling-gung-gung

Olha que coisa mais linda, mais cheia de graça
É ela a menina que vem e que passa
Num doce balanço a caminho do mar
Moça do corpo dourado do sol de Ipanema
O seu balançado é mais que um poema
É a coisa mais linda que eu já vi passar

Ah, por que estou tão sozinho?
Ah, por que tudo é tão triste?
Ah, a beleza que existe
A beleza que não é só minha
Que também passa sozinha

Ah, se ela soubesse
Que quando ela passa
O mundo sorrindo se enche de graça
E fica mais lindo por causa do amor

Tall and tan and young and lovely
The girl from Ipanema goes walking
And when she passes, each one she passes goes "ah!"
When she walks she's like a samba that
Swings so cool and sways so gently
That when she passes, each one she passes goes "ah!"

Oh, but he watches her sadly
How can he tell her he loves her?
Yes, he would give his heart gladly
But each day when she walks to the sea
She looks straight ahead not at he

Tall and tan and young and lovely
The girl from Ipanema goes walking
And when she passes he smiles
But she doesn't see

Oh, but he sees her so sadly
How can he tell her he loves her?
Yes, he would give his heart gladly
But each day when she walks to the sea
She looks straight ahead not at he

Tall and tan and young and lovely
The girl from Ipanema goes walking
And when she passes he smiles
But she doesn't see

She just doesn't see
No, she doesn't see
But she doesn't see
She doesn't see
No, she doesn't see
