The spirit never dies (No, no, no, no)
The spirit never dies (No, no)

You touch more than my skin
That's how you got in
So you see, it ain’t over
No matter if you go away
It ain't over
No matter what nobody say

Because the spirit never dies
No, no, no, no
The spirit never dies
No, no
The spirit never dies
No, no (No, no, no, no)
The spirit never dies, never dies (No, no, no, no, no)
No, no, no, no

I share a part of you
I'd never give away
Like I said, it ain’t over
No there ain't no еnd
You're always an eternal friеnd
There's such a lasting part
That always fills my heart
Never goes away
No, I know it's here to stay

Because the spirit never dies
No, no, no, no
The spirit never dies
No (No, no)
(The spirit never dies, no, no, no, no)
Never dies (The spirit never dies)
Stays alive
No, no-no (No, no, no, no)

The spirit never dies
No, no, no, no
The spirit never dies
No, no-no (No, no)
Never dies (The spirit never dies)
Stays alive (No, no, no, no)
