Why do you have me running every night and day?
We make good lovin' and now you tell me I can't stay
I live alone and I need someone to come home to
I hope and pray that someday that it will be you

All I wanna do is give, baby
All my love to you
Ever since we've been alone, I just can't stop thinking of
Of you
Nothing could change my mind
'Cause I love the way you hold me tight
And it was my very first time
Your security
I need it every night
Gonna give all my love to you, baby
That's what I'm gonna, gonna do
Gonna give all my love to you, baby
That's what I'm gonna, gonna do

Don't waste your time telling me not to come around
Your love for me is the only one that I have found
Don't try to hide and ignore me, drive me crazy
'Cause I'm for sure, you're my first love and I'm your lady

All I wanna do is give, baby
All my love to you
Ever since we've been alone, I just can't stop thinking of
Of you

You're trying to change my mind
And it's not the way I planned it to be
And it's been a very long time since you held me close
I need you desperately

Gonna give all my love to you, baby
That's what I'm gonna, gonna do
Gonna give all my love to you, baby
That's what I'm gonna, gonna do (Gonna do, ow)
Nothing will change my mind
'Cause I love the way you hold me tight
And it was my very first time
Your security (Ow)
Gonna give all my love to you, baby
That's what I'm gonna, gonna do
Gonna give all my love to you, baby
That's what I'm gonna, gonna do
Gonna give all my love to you, baby
That's what I'm gonna, gonna do
Gonna give all my love to you, baby
That's what I'm gonna (That's what I'm gonna do)
(Woo!)
