Wanna ride him like a bike
Ride him like a bike
I'll do anything he like
Anything he like
Whatever goes down
Imma let it slide
As long as I get to ride
Wanna ride him like a bike
Ride him like a bike
I'll do anything he like
Anything he like
Got me greased up babe
Feel it deep inside
Tonight I wanna ride
Sometimes love is just a walk in the park
It sure feels nice but doesn't draw my heart
When I ride him
I never get told
When I ride I'm in control
I start my engines real slow
Let the power flow
I can rev it up, Feel the thrust
Do a touch and draw
I can make a move
Feel a thrill
Take a break and make him wait
He likes to watch me do what I do
The kids are fucking drunk, oh
And I'm a cowgirl
He's tossing me around
And I hold up all the world
Keys are all I've lost
And I'm a distant land
I just hop up on the ride
And my body's in his hands
Gonna ride him like a bike
Ride him like a bike
I'll do anything he like
Anything he like
Whatever goes down
Imma let it slide
As long as I get to ride
Gonna ride him like a bike
Ride him like a bike
I'll do anything he like
Anything he like
Got me greased up, babe
Feel it deep inside
Tonight I wanna Ride
Ride him like a bike
Ride him like a bike
I'll do anything he like
Anything he like
Whatever goes down
Imma let it slide
As long as I get to ride
Gonna ride him like a bike
Ride him like a bike
I'll do anything he like
Anything he like
Got me greased up babe
Feel it deep inside
Tonight I wanna ride
