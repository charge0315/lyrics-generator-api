Walk around, and take it all in
Tell me now, where have I been?
Nothin' like reality to get your mind in gear
Lived my life to the extreme
A lost road to my dream
Found true reality
And now my mind is clear
I found out today
Love's a better way
In my heart I learned to listen
I was wrong to stray
Won't you let me stay?
You and me, baby, that's what's missin'

Love is, love is
Love is the greatest story
Love is, love is
Love is the power and glory
Runnin' hard from the past
I was goin' nowhere fast
Lookin' for a guarantee
My mind was so unclear
Played around, but never played smart
Never listened to my heart
Didn't know that your love
Was right here waiting for me
I found out today
Love's the only way
Baby, let us stay together
I was wrong
But my heart is strong
I'm lovin' you forever and ever
(Chorus)
Love is in my plans
Your greater love is what I've grown to understand
About being a man
I found out today
Love's the only way
Baby, let us stay together
I was wrong
But my heart is strong
I'm lovin' you forever and ever
Love is, love is
Love is the greatest story
(Repeat Chorus)
