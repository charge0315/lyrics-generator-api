You're like no one else that I have loved before
There's a certain something in my heart
For the first time in my life I know for sure
You're the love that I've been looking for
A few unsettled differences is where we stand
With a little effort we can work it out
I just want to hold you in my arms again
Find it in your heart to let me in

I want to spend the night with you
Make love like we used to do
Oh, I want to feel the fire within
I want to fall in love again
When the night is through
I want to spend the night with you
There's a full moon shining in the sky above
Let's don't waste this night on sad goodbyes
After all, it's you that I've been dreaming of
Let's give in to making up
Chorus (repeat and ad lib to fade)
