Hello, baby, just in case you didn't know, my name is Jeremy Jordan

People, can I get a J?
Then you add an E
Like my heart got an R
Now can I get an E, my mind
Now back to the J
Now can I get an o?
Like my heart got an R
And, yo, can I have a D, A, N?
All the fellas grab a girl with the biggest behind
And if you're dancin' at a party
Make sure she knows how to grind
If she doesn't have a girlfriend
I know she won't mind
My name is Jeremy
An' come on, everybody, let's unwind

All the girls grab a guy
Their bones hangin' real low
Grab a black or a whitе one
It don't matter how they lеt you low
Make sure get a thunder
Make sure it ain't wrong
My name is Jeremy Jo
Come on, everybody, sing my song

I'll be slow
Hey, y'all, the J is here, so have no fear
Jeremy Jordan is the name, seventy-three is the year
Chicago born, break and torn, try to step to him
You've all been warned!
(People, can I get a J) to the e-r-e-m-y j-o-r-d-a-n
Don't even try, Nikey knock physical or best believe that he can do it
Some one girl friend let him run

Im outta here y'all
Peace!
