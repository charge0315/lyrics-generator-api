You said you've had it
With insensitive guys
Not keepin' their promise
And telling sweet lies
When he stopped callin'
All of your dreams fell though
I've seen you troubled
I've seen you cry
I think I know
How to treat you right
I just wanna give my sweet love to you
Can I change your mind?
I've got so much to show you
If you give me the time
I could change your mind
It won't be the same
The sun's gonna shine
I'm here to tell you
We're not all the same
For what I'm guilty
I'll take the blame
It's important to you
To have a love that's real
I won't be unfaithful
I won't be unkind
Independently trusting
Is this heart of mine
I'll keep it comin'
And that is the deal
Can I change your mind?
I've got so much to show you
If you give me the time
I could change your mind
It won't be the same
The sun's gonna shine
Gonna shine
I could change your mind
Change your mind
I've got so much to show you
If you give me the time
I could change your mind
It won't be the same
The sun's gonna shine
