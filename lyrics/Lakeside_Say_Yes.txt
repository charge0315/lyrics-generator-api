Even now, when it seems
You have almost everything
You still get lonely, girl (You still get lonely)
Don’t you get lonely at night?
But the worst of it all
Every time that I give you a call
You still resist me, girl, oh
When all I wanna do is

To give all I can give
So that we can live
In ecstasy, just you and I, in love

(If you say)
If you say yes (Yes)
We’ll sail the stars
Say yes (Say yes)
With all my heart I’ll give you love
When you need it, right on time
I’m gonna  (If you say)
Say yes (Yes)
We’ll sail the sky, say yes (Say yes)
Just you and I
Together we’ll discover love like no one has ever done

If it seems hard to believe
It’s only how deep you
Falling in love (I’m in love)
Hey, won’t you give it a try (Give it a try, a try)
'Cause I’ll go all the way
If you’ll give from your heart every day (Come on with me, girl)
Come on, go with me
‘Cause all I wanna do

Is to give all I can give
So that we can live
In ecstasy, just you and I in love

(If you say)
If you say yes (Yes)
We’ll sail the stars, say yes (Say yes)
With all my heart, I’ll give you love
When you need it, right on time
I’m gonna  (If you say)
Say yes, (Yes)
Just you and I
Say yes (Say yes)
We’ll sail the skies together
We’ll discover love like no one has ever done

Oh, baby
I wanna give
All I can give
So that we
Can live
In ecstasy, just you and I
In love

(If you say)
If you say (Yes)
We’ll sail the stars, say yes (Say yes)
With all my heart, I’ll give you love
When you need it, right on time
I’m gonna  (If you say, yes)
We’ll make a new start, say yes (Say yes)
'Cause I’m gonna give you my heart
And my love
All you’ll ever need in this whole wide world
Say yes (Yes)
I’ll be standing by, say yes (Say yes)
Just you and I
Together we’ll discover love like no one has ever done
(If you say)
If you say yes (Yes)
I’m gonna give you my best (Say yes)
'Cause I love you and I need you, yes I do
Oh, right on time, I
Say yes (Yes)
I’m counting on you to say yes (Say yes)

Just to give you all that I can give (Right on time)
So we can live
Together
