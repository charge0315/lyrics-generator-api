My simple heart, My simple heart
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
My simple heart
Will always love you
I heard your reasons why you're leavin'
Can't we talk it through, yeah
I know I hurt you, you hurt me too
It's crazy what two lovers can do to each other
When emotions start fillin' up inside your head
It gets so complicated
We get so frustrated
What about the things you said?
My simple heart, My simple heart
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
My simple heart
Will always love you
I'm not the school kid you fell in love with
Somewhere back in time , yeah
You might have grown up, it's time to own up
You've had your lovers and yes I've had mine
But I love ya, I still want ya
There's so much that I can give, ooh
If we were less demandin', a little more understandin'
Together we can find a better way
My simple heart, Ooh-hoo, My simple heart
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
My simple heart
Will always love you
My simple heart, Ooh-hoo, My simple heart
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
My simple heart
Will always love you
Got a simple, simple heart that truly loves you
Yes I do now
And though we may have our problems darlin'
We'll make it through, Yes we will
And I swear this simple heart of mine
Will always love you, yeah
Don't ask me how I know
Don't ask me how I know
My simple heart, Ooh-hoo, My simple heart
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
My simple heart
Will always love you
My simple heart, Ooh-hoo, My simple heart
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
My simple heart
Will always love you
My simple heart, My simple heart
My simple heart, My simple heart
