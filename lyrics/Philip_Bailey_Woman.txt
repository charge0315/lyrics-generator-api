You are the thunder
You're the lightning up above
I call your name out
Woman, you are love
And when I touch you
I see heaven in your eyes
And when I kiss you
There's a storm rising within me
Woman, stay, show me the way
Into your heart, light up the dark
I've always dreamed
Of the love that you'd bring
Oh woman, stay, don't turn me away
You're the angel of light
Who leaves in the night, but I need you
Can't you see, I love you woman?
You are the fire
You're the wind that stirs my heart
You are the sunlight
Shining beauty in the dark
And when I saw you
I felt your power in my soul
And when you touched me
I knew I had lost control
Woman, stay, show me the way
Into your heart, light up the dark
I've always dreamed
Of the love that you'd bring
Oh woman, stay, don't turn me away
You're the angel of light
Who leaves in the night, but I need you
Can't you see, I love you woman?
You are the fire
You are the wind
You are the sunlight
I need you
Now I know
Heaven sent you from above
You are woman
You were sent for me to love
Woman, stay, but you'll go away
Now my eyes can see
All the love that I need
For the first time I can believe in woman
I can believe in woman
I need you by my side
You are the flower, you are the rain
You bring me sunlight
You bring me pain, woman
