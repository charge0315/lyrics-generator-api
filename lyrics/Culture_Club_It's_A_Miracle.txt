Guns that cross the street
You never know who you might meet
Who's in disguise
Ooh, as you blow a storm
There's no one there to keep you warm
It's no surprise
There's something in my eyes

It's a miracle, it's a miracle
It's a miracle, it's a miracle
It's a miracle, it's a miracle
And dreams are made of emotion

Dance with the counterfeit
The plastic smiles and micro heat
I'll meet you there
I'll meet you there
Run to the edge of town
Where Hollywood lay its footprints down
Monroe was there
But do you really care?

It's a miracle, it's a miracle
It's a miracle, it's a miracle
It's a miracle, it's a miracle
And dreams are made of emotion

(Cry) It's a miracle
(Oh, cry) It's a miracle
(Oh, cry) It's a miracle
(Oh, cry) It's a miracle

Guns that cross the street
You never know who you might meet
Who's in disguise
Who's in disguise
Ooh, as you blow a storm
There's no one there to keep you warm
It's no surprise
There's something in my eyes

It's a miracle, it's a miracle
It's a miracle, it's a miracle
It's a miracle, it's a miracle
And dreams are made of emotion

Woo, baby do, baby do, baby do, baby, do that bump, yeah
Oh, hoah, ho!

It's a miracle, it's a miracle
It's a miracle, it's a miracle
It's a miracle, it's a miracle
It's a miracle, it's a miracle
(It's a miracle) And dreams are made of emotion
(It's a miracle)
(It's a miracle) And dreams are made of emotion
(It's a miracle) Made of emotion
(It's a miracle)
(It's a miracle) And dreams are made of emotion
Yeah, emotion...
