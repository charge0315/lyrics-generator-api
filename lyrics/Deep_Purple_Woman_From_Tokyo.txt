Fly into the rising sun
Faces smiling, everyone
Yeah, she is a whole new tradition
Ow! I feel it in my heart

My woman from Tokyo
She makes me see
My woman from Tokyo
She's so good to me

Talk about her like a queen
Dancing in a eastern dream
Yeah, she makes me feel like a river
Ow! That carries me away

My woman from Tokyo
She makes me see
My woman from Tokyo
She's so good to me

But I'm at home and I, I just don't belong

So far away from the garden we love
She is what moves in the soul of a dove (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Soon I shall see just how black was my night
When we're alone in her city of light (Ooh-ooh-ooh)

Rising from the neon gloom
Shining like a crazy moon
Yeah, she turns me on like a fire
Ow! I get high!

My woman from Tokyo
She makes me see
My woman from Tokyo
She's so good to me

My woman from Tokyo
She makes me see
My woman from Tokyo
She's so good to me

(My woman from Tokyo)
(My woman from Tokyo)
(My woman from Tokyo)
(My woman from Tokyo)
(My woman from Tokyo)
