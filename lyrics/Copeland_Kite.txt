I hid myself from failure and fear
Oh, my dear, you're a threat to the bad in us all
They tell themselves that each word from your lips
Or the grace in your eyes overcomes any fall
Over the twilight, you're listening for me
Darling, go to sleep
Cradled by moonlight, I'm dreaming we'll be
Loved so deep
Floating and fighting, like a kite on a string
'Til you cut through my tether and changed everything
From the sky, you looked small, but I loved you the same
So I darted back quickly to spell out your name
And when they say that I'm just a terrible kite
You'll tell them you're proud of my marvelous flight
Don't hide yourself inside 'til I'm old
Oh, my dear, you're a threat to the bad we all see
I'm beside myself for the touch of your lips
Or the grace of your eyes that can see good in me
Over the twilight, you're listening for me
Darling, go to sleep
Cradled by moonlight, I'm dreaming we'll be
Loved so deep
Floating and fighting, like a kite on a string
'Til you cut through my tether and changed everything
From the sky, you looked small, but I loved you the same
So I darted back quickly to spell out your name
And when they say that I'm just a terrible kite
You'll tell them you're proud of my marvelous flight
