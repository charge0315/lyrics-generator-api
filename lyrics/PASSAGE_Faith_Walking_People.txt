Well, it seems with You there is something new
Every time I turn around
Oh, I never really know quite what to expect
But it won't get me down
Cause I know You bring each and everything
Just to teach me how to live
And the secret of it all is trusting in You
And the wisdom You give
Chorus:
So say goodbye to the feelings, cause the feelings go away
Say goodbye to the people, cause the people never stay
And say goodbye to the future, when it blinds you to today
And say goodbye to the reasoning that's standing in the way
Oh, we've got to break away
Break away to be faith-walking people
You can't rely on everything you feel
Faith-talking people, we must discern what's really real
Faith-walking people
You can't believe in everything you see
Faith-talking people, seems like such a mystery
And in all the earth
There is nothing worth half as much as life with You
Cause the people and things we're counting on here
They're gonna pass away too
I don't understand everything you've planned
But I don't really have to know
Cause He's giving me a joy that's filling my heart
When I've learned to let go
Repeat Chorus
