Baby, we can make love, Komachi-Angel
Maybe we are alright, say, "Yeah! Yeah!"
Tonight, we've got to make it, you're so wicked, Angel
Gonna love ya till the end, got a life (Yeah! Yeah!)

Red dress, an excess of a wicked sting
Can you see, now, I feel so strange?
I guess I can mess around with you someday
The night sky's saying it's true

Every time I wanna fall in love with someone
Illusions can be seen in hot summer night
But not a casual romance, gonna get serious
So don't twist my words and make up your mind
(Make you mine, mine)

Baby, we can make love, Komachi-Angel
Maybe we are alright, say, "Yeah! Yeah!"
Tonight, we've got to make it, you're so wicked, Angel
Gonna love ya till the end, got a life (Yeah! Yeah!)

Hot clump, hold some trump, evil eyes, catch me
You got Latin roots, I like it (Ooh, I like it)
Gonna stump, get the jump on the other guys 'round
Everybody, the die is cast

Oh, I can tell my heart is beating so loud
Baby, I'm sure you will make my dreams come true
I know you love me and you know I love you
C'mon, take my hands, and let's get out of here
(Out of here, yeah)

Baby, we can make love, Komachi-Angel
Maybe we are alright, say, "Yeah! Yeah!"
Tonight we've got to make it, you're my wicked Angel
Child of the sunlight, you mystify, uh (Yeah! Yeah!)

Baby, we can make love, Komachi-Angel
Lady, pay attention, say, "Yeah! Yeah!"
Tonight we've got to make it, you're my wicked Angel
Everybody push, push, we can say, "Yeah! Yeah!"
