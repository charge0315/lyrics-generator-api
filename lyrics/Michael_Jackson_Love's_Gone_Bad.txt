Ah, I feel a pounding in my brain
Ice-cold water runnin' through my pain
Got a bad taste in my mouth from bitter tears
Heart feel sad 'cause love's gone bad
I see a rainbow all in black
Must be a sign you ain't comin' back
Wake up at night callin' your name
I see a face on my window pane
I've been this way since you've been gone
Without your love, I can't go on
Look in the mirror, what do I see?
A cryin' face, kinda looks like me
Now, where's the love you promised me?
Where's the tenderness to comfort me?
Every time some love I choose
I seem to always be the one to lose
Bad taste in my mouth from bitter tears
Heart feels sad 'cause love's gone bad
Love's gone bad, heart feels sad
Ooh, black crows flying up above
It's a sign I live my life without love
Signs on the man, slime's on the sea
Signs everywhere I said I'm destined to be
And if the world where nothing's right
Since you've been gone
Can't sleep at night
You said you'd be true to me
Instead, you made a fool of me
Heart feel sad, love's gone bad
Ouw…
Auw, love's gone bad
Heart feel sad
Love's gone bad
Heart feel sad
Auw!! Ouw…
Ooh, love's gone bad
Heart feel sad
Love's gone bad
Love's gone bad
Auw!!
Love's gone bad
Love's gone bad
Come on!!!
