I was running on the common in the merry month of May
When a handsome young maiden I met on my way
She smiled at my Saltire and as I did pass
She said "I see you are a Thames man, shall we run on the grass?"

To run with the Hare & Hounds is my pride and my joy
To sport the old Saltire and to race like a boy
For the Thames men grow older, but they're never quite done
And when a pretty girl sees my Saltire I can still raise a run

Thames used to have a water-splash, the pride of the land
So cool and refreshing until it was banned
Now the girls up at Wimbledon, they sob and they sigh
For the lads from the Hare & Hounds keep their Saltires dry

To run with the Hare & Hounds is my pride and my joy
To sport the old Saltire and to race like a boy
For the Thames men grow older, but they're never quite done
And when a pretty girl sees my Saltire I can still raise a run

When I've run my last handicap and they lay me to rest
You'll find those Thames colours carried proud on my chest
But if I'm to get to Heaven, as I eagerly pray
It won't be the Thames Pioneers who point out the way

To run with the Hare & Hounds is my pride and my joy
To sport the old Saltire and to race like a boy
For the Thames men grow older, but they're never quite done
And when a pretty girl sees my Saltire I can still raise a run

Now here's to Thames Ladies, for they are the best
And the Saltire's irresistible when they wear the vest
And it's always "Ladies first" boys buying drinks in the pub
They're so charming, it's alarming, now they're all in the club

To run with the Hare & Hounds is my pride and my joy
To sport the old Saltire and to race like a boy
For the Thames men grow older, but they're never quite done
And when a pretty girl sees my Saltire I can still raise a run

When Jack was our President he was a regular sport
And if the waters were troubled he'd find the best port
With such men to lead us, who cares what Fate deals
For the best men, they are Thames men, of lofty ideals

To run with the Hare & Hounds is my pride and my joy
To sport the old Saltire and to race like a boy
For the Thames men grow older, but they're never quite done
And when a pretty girl sees my Saltire I can still raise a run

Now let's drink to Ranelagh, a club of fine skills
They run fast, they drink deep, and they're devils up hills
They excite you and delight you, whatever the task
But when it comes to hobble-gobbling, you'd better not ask

To run with the Hare & Hounds is my pride and my joy
To sport the old Saltire and to race like a boy
For the Thames men grow older, but they're never quite done
And when a pretty girl sees my Saltire I can still raise a run

Now here's to our neighbours, come over from France
The way that they run, it just leaves us no chance
Their warm-up's so tender, so Gallic, it's said
But all their best marathons are run in their bed

To run with the Hare & Hounds is my pride and my joy
To sport the old Saltire and to race like a boy
For the Thames men grow older, but they're never quite done
And when a pretty girl sees my Saltire I can still raise a run

An Aussie man once noted how untouched by progress we were
Seeing our love of miles, of drink and of song I must concur
But I look around today and his comment rings faux
For there is a fresh passion with which the Club continues to grow

To run with the Hare & Hounds is my pride and my joy
To sport the old Saltire and to race like a boy
For the Thames men grow older, but they're never quite done
And when a pretty girl sees my Saltire I can still raise a run

They say this is a sad world, and that life's a tough race, With toast-racks and dismal swamps to slow down your pace. But when the sun shines on my Saltire, my joy knows no bounds, So let's all drink good health to the Thames Hare & Hounds
