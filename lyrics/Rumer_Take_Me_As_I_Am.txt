Is there a place where all that I've lost
Will be returned to me?
And is there a day the souls that I pray to
Are coming back for me?
Don't tell me it's all right
It'll never be all right
Why don't you come, why don't you come back?
I need a love that's unconditional
Why don't you try to understand?
Why don't you come, why don't you come back?
If this love is unconditional, why don't you take me as I am?
Just take me as I am
The love that I seek, is it hidden beneath
A wound that won't bleed?
Look, is there something you want?
Is there something you need from me?
'Cause I tell you now, these hands are empty
And it aches in my bones to be here on my own without it
Watching the love that I'm craving
Getting further away from all that I wanted
So don't tell me it's all right now
It'll never be all right
Why don't you come, why don't you come back?
I need a love that's unconditional
Why don't you try to understand?
Why don't you come, why don't you come back?
If this love is unconditional, why don't you take me as I am?
Just take me as I am
If you look in my eyes
You'll see sorrow rising and falling
Oh, 'cause the love that I'm craving's
Getting further away from all that I wanted
