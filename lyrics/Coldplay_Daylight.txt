To my surprise, and my delight
I saw sunrise, I saw sunlight
I am nothing in the dark
And the clouds burst to show daylight

Ooh, and the sun shine
Yeah, on this heart of mine
Ooh, and I realise
Who couldn't live without
Ooh, come apart without it

On a hilltop, on a sky-rise
Like a firstborn child
And at full tilt, and in full flight
Defeat darkness, breakin' daylight

Ooh, and the sun shine
Yeah, on this heart of mine
Ooh, and I realise
Who couldn't live without
Ooh, come apart without daylight

Slowly breakin' through a daylight, slowly breakin' through a daylight
Slowly breakin' through a daylight, slowly breakin' through a daylight
Slowly breakin' through a daylight, slowly breakin' through a daylight
Slowly breakin' through a daylight, slowly breakin' through a daylight
Slowly breakin' through a daylight, slowly breakin' through a daylight
Slowly breakin' through a daylight, slowly breakin' through a daylight
Slowly breakin' through a daylight, slowly breakin' through a daylight
Slowly breakin' through a daylight, slowly breakin' through a daylight
Slowly breakin' through a daylight, slowly breakin' through a daylight
Slowly breakin' through a daylight, slowly breakin' through a daylight
Slowly breakin' through a daylight, slowly breakin' through a daylight
