Breathe

You get me so, get me so excited
I'm hot, come on, so ready, ready
And I'll open my spot for you
Anytime you want me to
So you can
Act bad, don't hurt me
Look sexy, talk dirty
And I'll open my spot for you
Anytime you want me to
So you can
Get me so excited

For some girls
It might be the money that really turns 'em on
But for me it's an attitude that keeps me dialing your phone
And no words are suitable to describe your swagger, babe
And my body is in overdrive, dying to have you inside of me, baby

If you like it, then I'll do it
I'll go head to toe
And whenever you pursue it
You'll never hear the word "no"
So, forget about them little girls, baby
'Cause now you're dealin' with a woman, baby, and
I'ma keep your body thumpin', baby
It's the least I can do
'Cause you get me so excited

I'm hot, come on, so ready, ready
(What you talking 'bout, shawty?)
And I'll open my spot for you
Anytime you want me to
So you can
Act bad, don't hurt me
Look sexy, talk dirty
And I'll open my spot for you
Anytime you want me to
So you can
Get me so excited

For some girls it's 'bout mind control
They don't wanna give dude their props
But as for me, I'ma let you know that my body's smoking hot
(From when you) Throw me up against whatever's close
And get to bossin' me around
And every time I give you the assist
You know how to slam it down

If you like it, then I'll do it
I'll go head to toe
And whenever you pursue it
You'll never hear the word "no"
So, forget about them little girls, baby
'Cause now you're dealin' with a woman, baby, and
I'ma keep your body thumpin', baby
It's the least I can do
'Cause you get me so excited

I'm hot, come on, so ready, ready
(What you talking 'bout, shawty?)
And I'll open my spot for you
Anytime you want me to
So you can
Act bad, don't hurt me
Look sexy, talk dirty
And I'll open my spot for you
Anytime you want me to
So you can
Get me so excited

Is ya, is ya, is ya hungry?
I gotcha, I gotcha, I gotcha lickin' on my, lickin' on my
Lickin' on my body body like it's something to eat
So you can act bad, don't hurt me
Look sexy

You get me so, get me so excited
I'm hot, come on, so ready, ready
(What you talking 'bout, shawty?)
And I'll open my spot for you
Anytime you want me to
So you can
Act bad, don't hurt me
Look sexy, talk dirty
And I'll open my spot for you
Anytime you want me to
So you can
Get me so excited
