Lovers, keep on the road you're on
Runners, until the race is run
Soldiers, you've got to soldier on
Sometimes even the right is wrong

They are turnin' my head out
To see what I'm all about
Keepin' my head down
To see what it feels like now
But I have no doubt
One day, we're gonna get out

Tonight, maybe we're gonna run
Dreamin' of the Osaka sun
Oh, oh
Dreamin' of when the mornin' comes

They are turnin' my head out
To see what I'm all about
Keepin' my head down
To see what it feels like now
But I have no doubt
One day, the sun'll come out

One, two, three

Reign of love, I can't let go
To the sea I offer this heavy load
Locust wind, lift me up
I'm just a prisoner in a reign of love

Locust wind, here I stop
How I wish I'd spoken up to a reign of love

Reign of love, by the church we're waitin'
Reign of love, on my knees go prayin'
How I wish I'd spoken up
Away get carried on a reign of love
