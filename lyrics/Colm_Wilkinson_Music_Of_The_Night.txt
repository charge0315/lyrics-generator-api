Night time sharpens, heightens each sensation
Darkness wakes and stirs imagination
Silently the senses abandon their defenses
Slowly, gently night unfurls it's splendor
Grasp it, sense it, tremulous and tender
Hearing is believing, music is deceiving
Hard as lightening, soft as candlelight
Dare you trust the music of the night
Close your eyes for your eyes will only tell the truth
And the truth isn't what you want to see
In the darkness it is easy to pretend
That the truth is what it ought to be
Softly, deftly, music shall caress you
Hear it, fear it, secretly possess you
Open up your mind, let your fantasies unwind
This darkness which you know you cannot fight
The darkness of the music of the night
Close your eyes, start a journey to a strange new world
Leave all thoughts of the world you knew before
Close your eyes and let music set you free
Only then can you belong to me
Floating, falling, sweet intoxication
Touch me, trust me, savour each sensation
Let the dream begin, let your darker side give in
To the power of the music that I write
The power of the music of the night
You alone can make the song take flight
Help me make the music of the night
