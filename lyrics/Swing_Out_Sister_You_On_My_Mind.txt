Friends say I'll get over you soon
Thoughts of you come back to fill me with gloom
Time forgets, but I'm not over you yet

There's no sense in asking why
Until the tears run dry

There's no one but you on my mind
Searching for a perfect ending that we'll never find (we'll never find)
If we could make it work this time (make it work this time)

Years have flown by since you've been gone
This broken heart of mine's been waiting too long
All alone without you I can't carry on

There's no sense in asking why
Until I'm there by your side

There's no one but you on my mind
Searching for a perfect ending that we'll never find (we'll never find)
If we could make it work this time (make it work this time)

We could plant tomorrow's dreams now together
In a garden to last for evermore
And the flowers would grow
From the seeds we'd sow, ba-da-da-bah, ba-ba-da-oo-ooh

There's no one but you on my mind
Searching for a perfect ending that we'll never find (we'll never find)
If we could make it work this time (make it work this time)
There'd be no sense in asking why
Waiting until the tears run dry
If I could make you change your mind
If we could make it work this time
There'd be no sense in asking why
Waiting until the tears run dry
If we could make it work this time
