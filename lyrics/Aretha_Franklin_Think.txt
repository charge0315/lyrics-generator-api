You better think (Think)
Think about what you're trying to do to me
Think (Think, think)
Let your mind go, let yourself be free

Let's go back, let's go back
Let's go way on to way back when
I didn't even know you
You couldn't have been too much more than ten (Just a child)
I ain't no psychiatrist, I ain't no doctor with degrees
But it don't take too much high IQ to see what you're doing to me

You better think (Think)
Think about what you're trying to do to me
Yeah, think (Think, think)
Let your mind go, let yourself be free

'Cause freedom (Freedom)
Stands for freedom (Freedom)
Oh, freedom
Yeah, freedom, right now
Freedom (Freedom)
Oh, freedom (Freedom)
You need you some freedom
Oh, freedom, oh, right now
Yeah, think about it!
You, think about it!

There ain't nothing you could ask
I could answer you but I won't (I won't)
But I was gonna change to "I'm not"
If you keep doing things I don't

You better think (Think)
Think about what you're trying to do to me
Oh oh-oh-oh think (What you're tryna to do to me)
(Think)
Let your mind go, let yourself be free

People walk around everyday
Playing games and taking scores
Trying to make other people lose their minds
Well, be careful you don't lose yours

Oh, think (Think)
Think about what you're trying to do to me
Wooh! Think (Think)
Let your mind go, let yourself be free

You need me (Need me)
And I need you (Don't you know?)
Without each other
There ain't nothing either can do

Oh, yeah, think about it, baby
(What you're tryin' do to me)
To the bone, baby
Think about it right now
Yeah, right now
(To the bone, for deepness) Oh, right now
(To the bone, for deepness) Yeah, right now
(To the bone, for deepness) You think about it, baby, baby, baby
(To the bone, for deepness) Oh, to the bone, baby
(To the bone, for deepness) Yeah, ooh
(To the bone, for deepness)
