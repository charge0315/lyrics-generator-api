Look at you, you're coming with the same old lies
Think you can win me over
Feels so good, I got you working hard this time
Who's fooling who?
Ah

Double check my smile, boy
I'm only playing along
You know tonight, boy
I ain't gonna say

Baby, guess you don't mean that much to me
Now I got you off of my mind, no (Got you off my mind)
Baby, tell you that word is history
Just a big mistake I won't repeat again, oh

(Ain't gonna say, ain't gonna say) Baby
(Ain't gonna say, ain't gonna say) Uh

So, you're back, you've got the look upon your face
Too bad I know you better
That's OK 'cause now I understand your game
I just can't lose

Now, look in my eyes, boy
You know I'll take you along just for the ride, boy
I ain't gonna say

Baby, guess you don't mean that much to me
Now I got you off of my mind, no (Got you off my mind)
Baby, tell you that word is history
Just a big mistake I won't repeat again, oh

(Ain't gonna say, ain't gonna say) Baby

Baby, tell you that word is history
Just a big mistake I won't repeat again, no
Oh, baby, guess you don't mean that much to me
Now I got you off of my mind, no (I ain't gonna say it)
Baby, tell you that word is history
Just a big mistake I won't repeat again, no (Ooh-ooh)
