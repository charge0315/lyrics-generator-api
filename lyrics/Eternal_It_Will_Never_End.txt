Hmm, oh yeah
It will never end, no
Never never end
You and I share a lifetime
Laughter, sunshine and rain
So secure
Yet sometimes with life comes change
Close my eyes
You'll be there and I know our love will never end
Hmm
Living alone can be lonely
Imagine living without you
By myself with no one and no place to run to
Once before, but never again
'Coz I know our love will never end
Even if you're far away, miles apart
It will never end
Even if I lose my way, I'll keep the faith
It will never end
It will never end
Having you near, what a feeling
I treasure each moment as they come
It's a fact that our love is true love that's begun
Holding, touching, entrusting to
And I know, our love will never end
Now nothing could be better
Than what we have together
It's funny how time made us to be
The love that grows between us
Is what we need to keep us
Forever now and all eternity
Now even if you go away, miles apart
It will never end
Even if I lose my way, I'll keep the faith
It will never end
It will never end
It will never end
Even if you go away, miles apart
It will never end
Even if I lose my way, I'll keep the faith
It will never end
Something that was meant to be, you and me
It will never end
It will never end
Say it will never
Say it will never
Say it will never, never end
Ooh
