(laughter) Citizens of science…

Citizens of science closed eyes
Just kill time hang up on phones
Stand alone in windows of empty rooms
They never wave, never give you time of day

They think in shifts dream with eye contact
Never notice blind dates
Drinking hard stuff, listen to the radio
Full blast and without a fuss, walk past

Citizens of science close their eyes
And breathe and breathe
Hang up on phones
Stand alone in windows of empty rooms
Stare from vacant bars
They never wave
Never give you the time of day!
Citizens of science think in shifts
Dream with eye contact
Never notice blind dates
Kill time on faceless stations
Drinking hard stuff
Listening to the radio full blast!

Citizens of science are silent
Citizens of science can smile
Citizens of science are silent
They know what is good for them

They think in shifts dream with eye contact
Never notice blind dates
Drinking hard stuff
Listen to the radio full blast
And without a fuss, walk past

Citizens of science are silent as walls for days
Then left on shelves breathe away
Citizens of science are silent
Citizens of science still smile
They know what's good for them!

Citizens of science are silent
Citizens of science can smile
Citizens of science are silent
They know what is good for them
Citizens of science are silent
Citizens of science can smile
Citizens of science are silent
They know what is good for them
Citizens of science are silent
Citizens of science can smile
Citizens of science are silent
They know what is good for them
Citizens of science are silent
Citizens of science can smile…
