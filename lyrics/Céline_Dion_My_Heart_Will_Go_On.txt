Rose, you're the most amazingly astounding
Wonderful girl, woman, that I've ever known
I'm not an idiot, I know how the world works
But I'm too involved now
You jump, I jump, remember?

Every night in my dreams
I see you, I feel you
That is how I know you go on
Far across the distance
And spaces between us
You have come to show you go on

Near
Far
Wherever you are
I believe that the heart does go on
Once more
You open the door
And you're here in my heart
And my heart will go on and on

Jack, I want you to draw me like one of your French girls
Wearing this
Alright
Wearing only this

Love can touch us one time
And last for a lifetime
And never let go 'till
We're gone
Love was when I loved you
One true time I'd hold to
In my life, we'll always
Go on

Near
Far
Wherever you are
I believe that the heart does go on (Why does the heart go on?)
Once more
You open the door
And you're here in my heart
And my heart will go on and on

Go on, I'll get the next one
No, not without you
I'll be alright, listen, I'll be fine
I'm a survivor, alright? Don't worry about me
Now go on, get on

You're here
There's nothing I fear
And I know that my heart will go on
We'll stay
Forever this way
You are safe in my heart
And my heart will go on and on

You must promise me that you won't give up
No matter what happens
Promise me now, Rose
I promise
And never let go that promise
I will never let go, Jack
I'll never let go
