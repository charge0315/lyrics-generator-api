Ha, ooh
Hey, ha
Huh
Uh
Ha

Time is truly wastin'
There's no guarantee, yeah
Smile is in the makin'
We got to fight the powers that be
Got so many voices
Saying all the same, yeah
Killing up all around me
Faces full of pain

I tried to play my music, they say my music's too loud
I tried talking about it, I got the big runaround
And when I rolled with the punches, I got knocked on the ground
By all this bullshit going down, hey

Time is truly wastin'
There's no guarantee, yeah
Smile is in the makin'
We got to fight the powers that be
I don't understand it
People wanna say, yeah
Those that got the answers
Red tape in the way
I could tend to it easy
That's just half the fun now, now
Seekin' my satisfaction
Keeps me on the run

I tried to play my music, say my music's too loud
I tried talking about it, I got the big runaround
And when I rolled with the punches, I got knocked on the ground
By all this bullshit going down, ooh

Time is truly wastin'
There's no guarantee, yeah
Smile is in the makin'
We got to fight the powers that be
