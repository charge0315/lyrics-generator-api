We're livin' in repetition
Content in the same old shtick again
Now the routine's turnin' to contention
Like a production line goin' over and over and over, roller coaster

Now I cannot speak
I've lost my voice
I'm speechless and redundant 'cause "I love you"'s not enough
I'm lost for words

Choreographed and lack of passion
Prototypes of what we were
Went full circle 'til I'm nauseous
Taken for granted, now I've wasted and faked it, ate it, now I hate it

'Cause I cannot speak
I've lost my voice
I'm speechless and redundant 'cause "I love you"'s not enough
I'm lost for words

Now I cannot speak
I've lost my voice
I'm speechless and redundant 'cause "I love you"'s not enough
I'm lost for words
Now I cannot speak
I've lost my voice
I'm speechless and redundant 'cause "I love you"'s not enough
I'm lost for words
