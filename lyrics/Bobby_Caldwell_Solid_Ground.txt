Here in the depths of my heart
I just can't imagine
If we were to part
Darling I must have done something right
And I knew from the moment
You walked into my life

Now there is no river
Or bridge we can't cross
No we won't be shaken
When all hope is lost
And the whole world could crumble
Or turn upside down
But our love will be standing
On solid ground

If the tide should ever run dry
If there were no longer
A star in the sky
Then our love would become
Twice as strong
And we would continue
Like nothing was wrong

Now there is no river
Or bridge we can't cross
No we won't be shaken
When all hope is lost
And the whole world could crumble
Or turn upside down
But our love will be standing
On solid ground

Hell may freeze over
And war may rage
Nothing can tear at the threads of devotion
Our love is strong enough
Deeper than the ocean

Now there is no river
Or bridge we can't cross
No we won't be shaken
When all hope is lost
And the whole world could crumble
Or turn upside down
But our love will be standing
On solid ground
