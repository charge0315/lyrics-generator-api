Please don't worry
'bout my soul
I've got summer in between the cold
Postcards from Hollywood
Enchantment by the sea
¿Cómo está?
Do you still think of me?
Please don't bother
'bout the time
Ain't no hurry when you walk the line
Postcards from Hollywood
They know just what to say
Wish you were here
I could be there today
With a fascination
Bordering on madness
We've born out the blues
Me and you
So please don't fever
Don't you melt
Cause daddy needs you
More than you can guess
Postcards from Hollywood
Wow, they sound like all the best
And I'm coming home
Back to what I do best
With a fascination
Bordering on madness
We've born out the blues
Me and you, oh, oh
Me and you, oh, oh
Me and you
So please don't worry
'bout my soul
I got summer in between the cold
Postcards from Hollywood
Enchantment by the sea
¿Cómo está?
Do you still think of me?
With a fascination
Bordering on madness
We've born out the blues
Me and you, oh, oh
With a fascination
Bordering on madness
We've born out the blues
Me and you, oh, oh
Me and you, oh, oh
You know it's true, oh, oh
Me and you, oh, oh
You know it's true
