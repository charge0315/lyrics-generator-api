My love, you got me dreaming that your next to me
And my love there is no place I would rather be
You make everything right pretty thing
Your the angel that I can’t be
You amaze me you complete me
And you turn me on how can that be wrong
Hold on tight gotta get it right, let it take all night
(For whatever it needs to be)
Hold on tight gotta get it right, let it take all night
(Come on, come on, let it go and heart shake it now)
Life on the dance floor here we go once again
Life on the dance floor here we go ‘till the end
Life on the dance floor here we go once again
Life
My love your body’s screaming
I can hear my name, I can hear my name
I don’t know what its doing to me it's kind of mental
Driving me insane, driving me insane
‘Cause you amaze me you complete me
You complete me
And you turn me on, girl you turn me on
And whatever your doing to me I hear my heart sing
How can that be wrong, how can that be wrong
Hold on tight gotta get it right let it take all night
(For whatever it needs to be)
Hold on tight gotta get it right let it take all night
(Come on come on let it go and heart shake it now)
Life on the dance floor here we go once again
Life on the dance floor here we go ‘till the end
Life on the dance floor here we go once again
Life
Come one baby I can’t understand I feel your heartbeat
Let me be that man, let me be that man
Hold on tight gotta get it right, let it take all night
(For whatever it needs to be)
Hold on tight gotta get it right, let it take all night
(Come on, come on, let it go on .. shake it now)
Hold on tight gotta get it right, let it take all night
(For whatever it needs to be)
Hold on tight gotta get it right, let it take all night
(Come on, come on, let it go on .. shake it now)
Night on the dance floor here we go once again
Life on the dance floor we’ll be here ‘till the end
Wife on the dance floor there she goes once again
Wife on the dance floor there she goes there she goes
Nights on the dance floor here we go once again
Lights on the dance floor will be here ‘till the end
Time for the dance floor here we go once again
Life
