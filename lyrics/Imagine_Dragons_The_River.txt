In the latest midnight hour when the world has gone to sleep
You gotta get up
When doubts begin to rise and the world is at your feet
You gotta get up

Reach
It's not as bad as it seems
I cleanse in the river for somebody else
For anyone but myself

But myself

I'm not a selfless man, I'm not a man of wealth
If I had all the world, probably give it to myself
But the trees begin to walk
And the ground begins to talk by myself

Reach
It's not as bad as it seems
I cleanse in the river for somebody else
For anyone but myself

Hold my place
Don't you give up on me
Hold on, hold on

Reach
It's not as bad as it seems
(Love doesn't come 'til you give it up)
(Love doesn't come 'til you give it up)
I cleanse in the river for somebody else
(Love doesn't come 'til you give it up)
(Love doesn't come 'til you give it up)
For anyone but myself
Reach
It's not as bad as it seems
(Love doesn't come 'til you give it up)
(Love doesn't come 'til you give it up)
I cleanse in the river for somebody else
(Love doesn't come 'til you give it up)
(Love doesn't come 'til you give it up)
