For those of you leaving to join a hunt
The name of this album is "back to front"
And those of you staying the whole way through
The name of this song is...
I hope you'll stay and have a cup of tea
Oh I hope you'll play my monopoly
And I hope you'll do what the others do
You say you'd love me to
Make that cup of tea like I said I would
Make that cup of tea like I know I should
And not to think what the others think
So that when you say you like me
I'll be so overjoyed
I'll take the unemployed
I'll give them all a job
They sure could use one, my God!
Isn't it funny, no
A million out of work is really so good for nothin'
When you think that there should be jobs by the dozen
But as often is the case
Nothing ever seems to take place
And not to think what the others think
So that when I say I like you
You'll say you like me too
You'll say you like me too
That's all
