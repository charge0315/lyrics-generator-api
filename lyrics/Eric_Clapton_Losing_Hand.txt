I gambled on your love, babe
Yes and got a losing hand
I gambled on your love, baby
Yes and got a losing hand
Your ways keep changing
Like the shifting desert sand
While I was playing fair, baby
Well you played a cheating game
While I was playing fair, baby
Yes you played a cheating game
Knew you didn't care, baby
But I loved you just the same
Thought I'd be your king, baby
Yes and you could be my queen
I thought I'd be your king, baby
Yes and you would be my queen
You used me for your joker
Because I thought your deal was clean
The way you did me, baby
I declare I'll never understand
The way you did me, baby
I declare I'll never understand
I gambled on your love, baby
And got a losing hand
