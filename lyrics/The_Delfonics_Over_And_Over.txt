I love you so
For you're the one I talk about
You don't believe
You think your love, I'll live without
Do you understand, understand?
I tried over and over again
I tried over and over again
I tried over and over and over again
Your friends all say
That I intend to break your heart
But why can't you see that
They'd be glad to see us part
Do you understand, understand?
I tried over and over again
I tried over and over again
I tried over and over and over again
Understand, understand
Over and over again
I tried over and over again
I tried over and over and over again
I tried over and over again
I tried over and over again
I tried over and over and over again
I tried over and over again
I tried over and over
