Hidin' in the pillows
With her clothes on under there
Signin' out the window
Taste the freedom of the air
Ronnie's got his daddy's car
So he has to take it slow
Anywhere but here my friend
Who cares where we go

Woah Kaila, don't stay out after midnight
There'll be murder to pay for
When she gets home
Whoa Kaila, you know your plan is airtight
The allure in the sweet life
Is there in the street light's glow

Party in the park now
All the senior boys are there
Shots of gin and vodka
Marijuana in the air
This is where I'm supposed to be
And I never want to go
As long as I'm in bed by dawn
Nobody has to know

Woah Kaila, don't stay out after midnight
There'll be murder to pay for
When she gets home
Whoa Kaila, you know your plan is airtight
The allure in the sweet life
Is there in the street light's glow

Nobody needs to know
Nobody needs to know
Nobody needs to know
Nobody needs to know

Woah Kaila, (Kaila babe)
Don't stay out after midnight
(Ooooh you know it ain't right)
There'll be murder to pay for
When she gets home, (when she gets home)
Whoa Kaila, (Kaila girl)
You know your plan is airtight
The allure in the sweet life
Is there in the street light's glow
