(You gotta go) Go where you wanna go
(And do) Do what you wanna do
(Wanna do with) With whoever you wanna do it with
(You want, hey, you gotta go) Go where you wanna go
(And do) Do what you wanna do
(Wanna do with) With whoever (You) you wanna do it with (Wanna do it with)

You don't understand
That a girl like me can't love just one man
Three thousand miles, that's how far you'll go
And you said to me
"Please don't follow"

(You gotta go) Go where you wanna go
(And do) Do what you wanna do
(Wanna do with) With whoever you wanna do it with
(You want, hey, you gotta go) Go where you wanna go
(And do) Do what you wanna do
(Wanna do with) With whoever you wanna do it with (You wanna do it with)

You don't understand
That a girl like me can't love just one man
You've been gone a week and I tried so hard
Not to be the cryin' kind
Not to be the girl you left behind (Left behind)

(You gotta go) Go where you wanna go
(And do) Do what you wanna do
(Wanna do with) With whoever you wanna do it with
(You want, hey, you gotta go) Go where you want
(And do) Do what you want
(Wanna do with) Go where you want
(Wanna do) Do what you want
(You want, hey, you gotta go) Go where you want
(And do) Do what you want
(Wanna do with) Go where you want
(Wanna do) Do what you want
(You want, hey, you gotta go) Go
