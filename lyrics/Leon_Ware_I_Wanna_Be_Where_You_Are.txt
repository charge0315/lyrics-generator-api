I wanna be where you are
I wanna be where you are
I wanna be where you are
I gotta be where you are
I wanna be, I wanna be, I wanna be
Ooh, can it be I stayed away too long?
Oh, did I leave your mind when I was gone
Now, it's not my thing trying to get back
Ooh, this time let me tell you where I'm at
You don't have to worry 'cause I'm coming
Back to where I should have always stayed
Now I've learned the meaning to your story
And it's enough love for me to stay
Ooh, can it be I stayed away too long?
Did I leave your mind when I was gone
Ooh, it's not my thing trying to get back
Ooh baby, let me tell you where I'm at
I wanna be where you are
Anywhere you are
I wanna be where you are
Anywhere you are
Please don't close the door to our future
There's so many things we haven't tried
I could love you better than I used to
And give you all the love I have inside
I wanna be where you are
Baby, where you are
I wanna be where you are
I wanna be where you are
I wanna be, I wanna be, I wanna be
Can it be I stayed away too long?
Did I leave your mind when I was gone
Ooh, it's not my thing trying to get back
Baby, I'm gonna tell you where I'm at
I wanna be where you are
Anywhere you are
I wanna be where you are
Anywhere you are
I wanna be where you are
