Let's try this flow
Just follow it, beat it
There's no need for you, baby
It ain't what you think, so don't worry

You remember back in the day when we'd vibe?
It was special and we always stayed down
No matter where I went, you'd stay in touch
Two people that were just so in love
Now you claiming that you feelin' like things
Ain't really been the way they used to be
And you say that it seems like I've changed
But I'm still the same

There's no need for you (To worry 'bout me), oh
Baby, (Don't worry 'bout me), no, no, no
It ain't what you think (You still got me)
So don't worry (Don't worry 'bout, don't worry 'bout me)
Even though it seems (You're losing me)
And things (Ain't what they used to be)
Baby (I ain't gonna leave), so don't worry
(Don't worry 'bout, don't worry 'bout me)

I was headin' out to Cali for a show
Told you that on Tuesday I'd be home
Left a message on your voicemail
Sayin' I'd call you later to inform you I'm alright
Now you callin' just to tell me that you heard
I was seen in a Bentley with my girls
So I'm on my way to a spot where people hang
But nothing's changed

There's no need for you (To worry 'bout me)
Baby, (Don't worry 'bout me), no
It ain't what you think (You still got me)
So don't worry, you still got me, yeah
Even though it seems (You're losing me)
And things (Ain't what they used to be)
Baby, (I ain't gonna leave), so don't worry
(Don't worry 'bout, don't worry 'bout me)

There's no need for you (To worry 'bout me)
Baby, (Don't worry 'bout me), oh
It ain't what you think, (You still got me), so don't worry, oh
(Don't worry 'bout, don't worry 'bout me)
Even though it seems (You're losing me)
And things (Ain't what they used to be)
Baby, (I ain't gonna leave), don't worry, oh
(Don't worry 'bout, don't worry 'bout me)

There's no need to worry 'bout what I do when I'm away
(Don't worry 'bout a damn thing)
Don't worry 'bout what I do in my time
(Don't worry 'bout a damn thing)
Don't worry 'bout how I do when I put it down
(Don't worry 'bout a damn thing)
Trust in me everything's gonna be alright
(Don't worry 'bout a damn thing)
We're gonna work it out, I'll be home tonight

There's no need for you to worry 'bout me
Baby (Don't worry 'bout me)
It ain't what you think (Don't worry 'bout me)
So don't worry (Don't worry 'bout me)
Even though it seems (Don't worry 'bout me)
And things (Don't worry 'bout me)
Baby (Don't worry 'bout me)
So don't worry (Don't worry 'bout me)
There's no need for you (To worry 'bout me), no
Baby (Don't worry 'bout me)
(No) It ain't what you think (You still got me)
So don't worry (Don't worry 'bout)
Even though it seems (You're losing me)
And things (Ain't what they used to be)
Baby (I ain't gonna leave), baby
Don't worry, (Don't worry 'bout, don't worry 'bout me)
There's no need for you (To worry 'bout me)
Baby (Don't worry 'bout me)
It ain't what you think (You still got me)
So don't worry (Don't worry 'bout me)
Even though it seems (Don't worry 'bout me)
And things (Don't worry 'bout me)
Baby, I ain't gonna leave
So don't worry, (Don't worry 'bout me, don't worry 'bout me)
