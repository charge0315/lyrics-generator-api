When I was a young boy, I tried to listen
And I wanna feel like that
Little white shadows, blink and miss them
Part of a system, I am

If you ever feel like something's missing
Things you'll never understand
Little white shadows sparkle and glisten
Part of a system, a plan

All this noise, I'm waking up
All this space I'm taking up
All this sound is breaking up
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

Maybe you'll get what you wanted
Maybe you'll stumble upon it
Everything you ever wanted
In a permanent state
Maybe you'll know when you see it
Maybe if you say it, you'll mean it
And when you find it, you'll keep it
In a permanent state, a permanent state

When I was a young boy, I tried to listen
Don't you wanna feel like that?
You're part of the human race, all of the stars and the outer space
A part of the system, a plan

All this noise, I'm waking up
All this space I'm taking up
I cannot hear, you're breaking up
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

Maybe you'll get what you wanted
Maybe you'll stumble upon it
Everything you ever wanted
In a permanent state
Maybe you'll know when you see it
Maybe if you say it, you'll mean it
And when you find it, you'll keep it
In a permanent state, a permanent state

Swimming on a sea of faces, tide of the human races
Oh, an answer now is what I need…
I see it in a new sun rising, see it break on your horizon
Oh, come on love, stay with me…
