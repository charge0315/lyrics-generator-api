Listen to the sounds
Rhyming kites in the wind
Gleaming all around
They are whispering things
Listen to the sounds
And embrace what they bring
Look beyond the clouds
Meet the sun riding high
Let your eyes search out
In a wondering flight
Look beyond the clouds
For the meaning of light
Turn into yourself
And caress what you feel
Have your feelings dwell
On the times that reveal
Turn into yourself
Find the gift of what's real
Face your rising heart
Let its joy dry your tears
Write upon the sand
Ancient songs that are here
Face your rising heart
Misty rose, blooming near
Come close
To the inner spring
Of dreams and love
Be free
And reach out
The first time to feel true love
Is now
(Interlude/Synth Solo)
Come close
To the inner spring
Of dreams and love
Be free
And reach out
The first time to feel true love
Is now
Surf the waves of chance
And be spelled by the sight
Of your gliding dance
Overcoming the tide
Surf the waves of chance
Born anew, passed the night
Breathing life
