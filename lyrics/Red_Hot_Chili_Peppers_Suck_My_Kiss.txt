And I'm sailin', yeah
Yeah, oh yeah
Yeah... oh yeah
Hit me!

Shoulda been, coulda been, woulda been dead
If I didn't get the message goin' to my head
I am what I am, most motherfuckers don't give a damn
Oh, baby, think you can, be my girl, I'll be your man
Someone full of fun do me 'til I'm well done
Little Bo Peep cummin' from my stun gun
Beware, take care, most motherfuckers have a cold ass stare
Oh, baby, please be there, suck my kiss, cut me my share

Hit me, you can't hurt me, suck my kiss
Kiss me, please pervert me, stick with this
Is she talking dirty?
Give to me sweet sacred bliss, your mouth was made to suck my kiss

Look at me, can't you see, all I really want to be
Is free from a world that hurts me
I need relief, do you want me, girl, to be your thief?
Oh, baby just for you, I'd steal anything that you want me to
K-i-s-s-i-n-g, chicka-chicka-dee, do me like a banshee
Low brow is how, swimming in the sound of bow-wow-wow
Oh, baby, do me now, do me here I do allow

Hit me, you can't hurt me, suck my kiss
Kiss me, please pervert me, stick with this
Is she gonna curtsy?
Give to me sweet sacred bliss, that mouth was made to

Shoulda been, coulda been, woulda been dead
If I didn't get the message goin' to my head
I am what I am, most motherfuckers don't give a damn
Oh, baby, think you can, be my girl, I'll be your man
Someone full of fun do me 'til I'm well done
Little Bo Peep cummin' from my stun gun
Beware, take care, most motherfuckers have a cold ass stare
Oh, baby, please be there, suck my kiss, cut me my share

Hit me, you can't hurt me, suck my kiss
Kiss me, please pervert me, stick with this
Is she talking dirty?
Give to me sweet sacred bliss, that mouth was made to suck my kiss
