It don't hurt like it did
I can sing my song again
It don't hurt like it did
I can sing my song again

Scraped the paper off the wall
I put down carpet in the hall
I left no trace of you at all
And I can sing my song again

I don't dream 'cause I don't sleep
The moon is hanging like your hat
The sun comes up
Well, I don't see
Curtains tied up like a bat
The electric man looks good today
Maybe not, well, I'm tryin' hard
Tryin' hard to feel that way
The electric man's a good place to start

Took your paintings off the wall
That one of me that you called doll
I added on 'cause the house was feelin' small
Now I can sing my song again

I don't think of you no more
Except for every day or two
I don't think of you no more
Except for in between the sun and moon

Packed up and moved out after all
Bulldozed the house and watched it fall
And that blessed sight I still recall
And I can sing my song again
And I can sing my song again

It don't hurt like it did
It hurts worse
Who do I kid?
