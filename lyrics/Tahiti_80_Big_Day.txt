Come and get it, come and get it now
There's a big day waiting for you
Come and get it, come and get it now
Such a big day waiting for you
If you're willing just to take a chance
You gonna shine, shine on, my friend
Shine on, my friend
You were there up in my room
Didn't have a word to say
Suddenly you started to move
So i thought that must be a way
To get a little closer to you
Oooh ooh ooh
Just to get a little closer to you
Oooh ooh ooh
Come and get it, come and get it now
There's a big day waiting for you
Come and get it, come and get it now
Such a big day waiting for you
If you're willing just to take a chance
You gonna shine, shine on, my friend
Shine on, my friend
Maybe you got something to prove
I'll clear your doubts away
Nothing can happen too soon
Too late to think about it anyway
Just to get a little closer to you
Oooh ooh ooh
Just to get a little closer to you
Oooh ooh ooh
Come and get it, come and get it now
There's a big day waiting for you
Come and get it, come and get it now
Such a big day waiting for you
If you're willing just to take a chance
You gonna shine, shine on, my friend
Shine on, my friend
A new day is rising
I know exactly what i'm doing
I feel
I feel little things falling in today
After all this waiting
I know, i know
Come on there's a big day
Yeah such a big day
Come and get it now
Now
Now
Now
Come and get it now
Just to get a little closer to you
Oooh ooh ooh
Just to get a little closer to you
Oooh ooh ooh
Just to get a little closer to you
Oooh ooh ooh
Just to get a little closer to you
Shine on
Come and get it, come and get it now
Come and get it, come and get it now
Come and get it, come and get it now
Come and get it,  come and get it now
Come and get it, come and get it now
Come and get it,  come and get it now
Just to get a little closer to you
Such a big day
