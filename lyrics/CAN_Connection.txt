My connection is your connection
The sun is shining, I see you smile
Turning it over I see the clover
The things that I want, dear, are nothing dull
My connection is your connection
The sun is shining, I see your face
Turning it over I see the clover
The things that I love, dear, are taking the shame
My connection is your connection
The sun that I love, dear, is turning inside
Falling is under the things that I wonder
The light that I bring, dear, is bringing its sight
My connection is your connection
The things that I want, dear, are always in sight
Turning it over I see the clover
The things that I want, dear, are nothing dull
My connection is your connection
The things that I love, dear, are always the same
Turning it over I see in the clover
The things that I love, dear, don't bring the rain
