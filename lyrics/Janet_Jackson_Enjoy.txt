Enjoy
(Wassup?) Hahaha

I wake up 7 a.m., about time we do it again
Sunshine today, I better make plans
'Cause it rained yesterday, but that was okay
Can't complain, I love it either way
Living every day like it's my last
I refuse to be stuck in the past
People actin' like machines
'Cause they're scared to live their dreams
No, not me

I just enjoy and celebrate, enjoy the love we make
Enjoy, appreciate, enjoy
Just keep on doing it 'til my heart's content
And enjoy when someone smiles, enjoy
So just enjoy the simple things, enjoy the day life brings
Enjoy the song love sings, enjoy
Just keep on doing it 'til your heart's content
And enjoy the gift of life, enjoy

If you wanna find your paradise
Do it now, never too late to try
Lose your inhibition, let your inspiration set you free

And just enjoy and celebrate, enjoy the love we make
Enjoy, appreciate, enjoy
Just keep on doing it 'til my heart's content
And enjoy when someone smiles, enjoy
So let's enjoy the simple things, enjoy the day life brings
Enjoy the song love sings, enjoy
Just keep on doing it 'til your heart's content
And enjoy the gift of life, enjoy
