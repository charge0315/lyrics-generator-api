Sing baby sing
The world is getting better
It's somethin' else since we're together
Let's have a ball
Let's do it all and sing

Ain't we got it made
(Sing baby sing)
Ain't we got it made
(Sing baby sing)

Dance baby dance
And let the sun shine on us
There ain't a blessed thing to stop us
Let's live it up, fill up the cup and dance

Ain't we got it made
(Dance baby dance)
Ain't we got it made
(Dance baby dance)

Ain't we got it made
Our love song has no end
We're not only lovers
We are friends

So cry baby cry, our wedding bells are ringing
And while the happy choir is singin'
This girl and boy through tears of joy will sing

Ain't we got it made
(Sing baby sing)
Ain't we got it made
(Sing baby sing)

So cry baby cry, our wedding bells are ringing
And while the happy choir is singin'
This girl and boy through tears of joy will sing

Ain't we got it made
(Sing baby sing)
Ain't we got it made
(Sing baby sing)
Ain't we got it made
(Sing baby sing)
Ain't we got it made
(Sing baby sing)
Ain't we got it made
(Sing baby sing)
(Sing baby sing)...
