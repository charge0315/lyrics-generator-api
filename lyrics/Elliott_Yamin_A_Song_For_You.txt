I've been so many places in my life and time
I've sung a lot of songs, and I made some bad rhymes
I‘ve acted out my life on stages, with ten thousand people watching
But were alone now, and I'm singing this song to you
I know your image of me is what I hope to be
I've treated you unkindly, but darlin' can't you see
There's no one more important to me, baby can't you see through me
Cuz were alone now, and I'm singing this song to you
You taught me precious secrets, Of a true love, with holding nothing
You came out in front when I was hiding
But now I'm so much better, and if my words don't come together
Listen to the melody, cuz my love is in there hiding
I love you in a place, where there's no space or time
I love you for my life, you're a friend of mine
And when my life is over, remember, remember when we were together
We were alone and I was singing this song to you
I love you in a place, where there's no space or time
Said I love you for my life, you're a friend of mine
And when my life is over, remember, remember when we were together
We were alone and I was singing this song to you
We were alone and I was singing this song to you. (2x)
Singing this song to you
