Don't think I haven't noticed you, girl
'Cause I noticed you right away
And don't think I haven't been listenin', girl
'Cause I hear everything you say

Yes, I'd like to hang around
But I'll have to let you down
I just haven't got what it takes
To put up with you

Don't think I'm not impressed with your looks
'Cause I think that you look just fine
And don't think I haven't considered you, girl
Or the fact that you could be mine

Yes, I'd like to hang around
But I'll have to let you down
I just haven't got what it takes
To put up with you

There's really nothing to gain (Nothing to gain from knowin' you)
I won't be a part of your chain (Don't want to join the others)
Of broken hearts

Yes, I'd like to hang around
But I'll have to let you down
I just haven't got what it takes
To put up with you

To put up with you
To put up with you
