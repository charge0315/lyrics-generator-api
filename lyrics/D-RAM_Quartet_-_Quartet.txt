Oh, Ms. Dramatic's walking with her mother
You know that’s Mrs. Primadonna
You know she's doing alright
You know she's doing alright
You know she’s doing alright
And now she's screaming, "Rebel, rebel"
Ooh, she swear she loves David Bowie
Well, he ain't doing alright
Oh, he ain't doing alright
Oh, he ain't doing alright

Oh, she reaches out and says
"Hey, I think it's time to come down
It's time to stop playing around”
This ain't holding on

It’s a mindset, there’s a lookout
It's an omen, oh my god
Tryna keep my head above the water
Screams out
Uh, ’cause I don't really want to
Uh, 'cause I don't really want to (Hey)
Uh, ’cause I don't rеally want to, love

Oh, Ms. Dramatic's with her father
Mm, you know that's Mr. Ovеrture
You know he's doing alright
You know he's doing alright
You know he's doing alright
Well, I'm rocking Mississippi blood
Oh, another kid, another stone
Oh, another do, another don't
Can you read my mind?
Can you read my mind?
Can

She reaches out and says
"Hey, I think it's time to come down
It's time to stop playing around”
But this ain't holding on

It's a know-how, it's a freakout
But it's getting worse, my god
Tryna keep my head above the water
Scream out
'Cause I don't really want to
'Cause I don't really want to
'Cause I don't really want to, love
But there's a gold house, it's a deep cut
And I'm screaming, "Oh my lord"
Tryna keep my head, head, head above the water, oh
'Cause I don't really want to
Uh, 'cause I don't really want to
'Cause I don't really wanna know
