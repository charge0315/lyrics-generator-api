My heart was blowin' in the hurricanes
My heart was blowin' in your love, in your love, no
My heart was flyin' in tornadoes
My heart was flyin' in your love, in your love

You see, I tried, baby, oh, did I try
The more I get closer to you, the more I know you just won't do
You see, I tried, girl, you know I tried (oh, I tried)

But you're a natural disaster, oh
You're a natural disaster, oh, oh, oh

My mind was frozen in the blizzards
My mind was frozen in your love, in your love
My mind was burnin' in the (wildfire)
My mind was burnin' in your love, in your love

You see, I tried, baby, you know I tried
But, girl, I hate myself when you're near
Honey, get up and get out of here
You see, I tried, darling, did I try (oh, I tried)

But you're a natural disaster, oh
You're a natural disaster, oh, oh, oh

My body was shakin' in your earthquakes (Yeah)
You had my body quakin' (in your love) from your love (oh, in your love)
My life was drownin' in tsunamis
You pulled me under baby (in your love) with your love, (oh, in your love) with your love

I'm telling you, I tried, did I ever try
But in the end I'm broken and hurt
Now I know it'd never work
You see, I tried, honey, oh, did I try (oh I tried)

My soul, it died in Armageddon
My soul, it died from your love, from your love
You're bringin' these plagues on me
You brought me to my knees from your love, from your love

You see, I tried, Lord, did I try
But, girl, you're rainin' hell on my earth
I pray to heaven to find real worth
You see, I tried, baby, oh, did I try (oh, I tried)

But you're a natural disaster, oh
You're a natural disaster, oh, oh, oh
But you're a natural disaster, oh
You're a natural disaster, oh, oh, oh
(You're a natural disaster)
