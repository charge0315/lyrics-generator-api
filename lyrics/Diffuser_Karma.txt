Started from the end
The worst is the best thing that I ever knew
Moses is my friend
Since I'm playing second fiddle in the duet
Paying for what I am regretting
Sometimes you get what you want
Sometimes you get what you need
But you're always going to get what you deserve
It's all about what you want
If you can get what you need
You're always going to get what'
Elvis isn't dead
He's just on vacation with Jim Morrison
Sold my soul again
While I was whistling Dixie in a panic
Beelzebub was clapping frantically
Sometimes you get what you want
Sometimes you get what you need
But you're always going to get what you deserve
It's all about what you want
If you can get what you need
You're always going to get what'
Sometimes you get what you want
Sometimes you get what you need
But you're always going to get what you deserve
It's all about what you want
If you can get what you need
You're always going to get what'
Sometimes you get what you want
Sometimes you get what you need
But you're always going to get what you deserve
It's all about what you want
If you can get what you need
You're always going to get what you deserve
Sometimes you get what you want
Sometimes you get what you need
But you're always going to get what you deserve
You're always going to get what'
