Don't deceive me
Please don't leave me
What would I do without you to see me through
If you leave me
If you grieve me
What would I do without you to see me through
If you hurt me
If you desert me
What would I do, without you, to see me through
What would I do
Say I want to know
What would I do
Where would I go
How you please me
When you squeeze me
What would I do without you
To see me through
What would I do
All I want to know
What would I do
Where would I go
Don`t You know I`m so crazy about my baby?
What would I do without you, to see me through
