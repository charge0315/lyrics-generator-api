Oh, come pity me, a poor mad sailor
Stranded on this love
Here I lie like driftwood, honey
Is this what I've become?

I go high over
Down under
At a lady's will
Under you
At a lady's will
I'm drifting still
I'm drifting still

So I ask in fading innocence
And all my youthful rage
Will your hands still touch me
When my face has fallen in with age?

And I go high over
Down under
At a lady's will
Under you
High over
Down under
At a lady's will
Under you
At a lady's will
I'm drifting still
I'm drifting still

High over
Down under
At a lady's will
High over
Down under
At a lady's will
