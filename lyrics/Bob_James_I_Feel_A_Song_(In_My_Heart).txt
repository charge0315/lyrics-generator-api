Ooh, I loved you so
But why I loved you, I'll never know
You found a reason for leavin'
Soon as I gave my love to you
Ooh, the pain you put me through
You know you've killed my love for you
But I found a reason for livin'
I'm through with cryin' over you

And now I feel a song in my heart again
I knew as soon as I felt you lookin' through me
I feel a song in my heart again
High on the wings of the things he's doin' to me, woo

Ooh, that a man is fine
What's even better, the man is mine
He makes me feel just like a woman
Something that you could never do

And now I feel a song in my heart again
I found a man who can put it all together
I feel a song in my heart again
I'm gonna love him and make it last forever, woo

I can feel it
There's a song in my heart
I can feel it
There's a song in my heart
I can feel it
There's a song in my heart
I can feel it
There's a song in my heart
I can feel it
There's a song in my heart
I can feel it (Yeah)
There's a song in my heart
I can feel it (I can feel a song in my heart again)
There's a song in my heart
I can feel it (I can feel a song in my heart again)
There's a song in my heart
I can feel it (I can feel a song in my heart again)
There's a song in my heart (Ooh)

There's a song in my heart
I can feel it (I can feel a song in my heart again)
There's a song in my heart (Ooh)

There's a song in my heart

Ooh, it feels so good
You, you, you, you never understood
He makes me feel like I'm somethin'
And I'm gonna keep him if I can

I know I feel a song in my heart again
Now I can open my eyes to a new door
I feel a song in my heart again
The man is all I needed, ooh, to carry on
I feel a song in my heart again
I feel it takin' me, ooh, hoo-hoo-hoo
I feel a song in my heart again
Ooh, his kind of lovin', I can never get enough of

Don't need your lovin' 'cause I got his lovin'
Ooh, hoo-hoo, I feel a song again, oh
I feel a song in my heart again (Feel a song in my heart again)
His kind of lovin', I can never get enough of
