Promise me you will be
By my side through thick and thin
If you say you will stay
We can let our love begin

In return take this heart of mine
Just remember you'll never find
A heart so kind
Or a lover love so fine

Never before was I free to fall for anyone
Never before could I see it all within you
Now, there's you

Make a vow here and now
You will always be my own
Tell me you will be true
And I won't be left alonе

In return take this heart of minе
Just remember you'll never find
A heart so kind
Or another love so fine

Never before was I free to fall for anyone
Never before could I see it all within you
Now, there's you
