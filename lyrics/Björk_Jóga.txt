All these accidents that happen
Follow the dot
Coincidence makes sense
Only with you
You don't have to speak
I feel

Emotional landscapes
They puzzle me
The riddle gets solved
And you push me up to

This state of emergency
How beautiful to be
State of emergency
Is where I want to be

All that no one sees, you see
What's inside of me
Every nerve that hurts, you heal
Deep inside of me, ooh
You don't have to speak
I feel

Emotional landscapes
They puzzle me
Confuse
Can the riddle get solved?
And you push me up to

This state of emergency
How beautiful to be
State of emergency
Is where I want to be
State of emergency
How beautiful to be

Emotional landscapes
They puzzle me
The riddle gets solved
And you push me up to

This state of emergency
How beautiful to be
State of emergency
Is where I want to be
State of emergency
How beautiful to be

State of emergency
