You are the love of my life
You are the love of my life
::
You are the love of my life
You are the reason i'm alive
And baby baby baby
When i think of how you saved me
I go cracy, oh......
And i've never known love like is
It fills me with a new tenderness
You're in my heart and you're in my soul
You're all i can't resist
And i need to tell you
The first time i held you
I knew, you are the love of my life
And i spend a life time waiting
Always hesistating until you
I was lost so deep inside my shell
Till you came and saved me from myself
Now all i really know is i need you
You are the love of my life
And all the joy and tears that i cry
And baby baby baby
You don't have to say the word
I see it in your eyes
'cause we stand together
I promise forever till the day that i die
You are the love of my life
You are the love of my life
You are the reason i'm alive
