Mm, yeah

You tell me actions speak louder
But there's something about her words
That hurt
Closing up, it's so late and
I'm the last one still waiting for you to unlock the door

On our way home, I realize
There's some kind of storm brewing in his eyes
Only veiled by a thin disguise
And now that I've done my time
I, need to move on and I need you to try
'Coz we're out of goodbyes
We're out of goodbyes
Out of goodbyes

Never asked you to change
But sadly you don't feel the same
About me
I wonder, does your man still shudder
When you touch his hand?
Like this man

And on our way home I realize
There is some kind of storm brewing in his eyes
Only veiled by a thin disguise
Now that I've done my time, I
I need to move on and I need you to try
'Coz we're out of goodbyes
We're out of goodbyes (We're out of goodbyes)
We're out of goodbyes (We're out of goodbyes)
Oh, ooh-ooh
(Mm, oh-oh)
