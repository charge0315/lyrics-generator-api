They say that our love is all wrong
And that we should not carry on
But I say they're wrong
I want you so bad (I want you so bad)
Oh, we've been together for so long
How could they think we don't belong?
But they'll never know what you and I have, oh

Call your mama
Call your papa
Call the preacher
Hold on, hold on
Call your mama
Call your papa
Go on and call the preacher
Hold on, hold on

All I wanna do is take it all the way with you
It's your life, it's your life
All I wanna do is take it all the way with you
It's your life (It's your life), it's your life

They say that we don't have a chance
We're victims of unjust romance
But they couldn't see the truth in their hands
We don't have to live like they do
We'll run away if we have to
And we'll start a life that's shining and new
That's shining and new

Call your mama
Call your papa
Go on and call the preacher
Hold on, hold on
Call your mama
Call your papa
Call the preacher
Hold on, hold on

All I wanna do is take it all the way with you
It's your life (It's your life), it's your life
All I wanna do is take it all the way with you
It's your life (It's your life), it's your life
All I wanna do is take it all the way with you
It's your life, it's your life
All I wanna do is take it all the way with you
It's your life (It's your life), it's your life

All I wanna do is take it all the way with you
It's your life (It's your life), it's your life (Oh)
All I wanna do is take it all the way with you
It's your life (It's your life), it's your life
All I wanna do is take it all the way with you
It's your life, it's your life
All I wanna do is take it all the way with you
It's your life (It's your life), it's your life
(It's your life)
