Butterfly, butterfly
Flying into the wind
You can be sure of it
That's no place to begin
Over-thinking every little thing
Acknowledge the bell you can't unring

Tomorrow
There will come a time in the morning
You will find a way to begin

Butterfly, butterfly
Flutter into the skies
Butterfly, butterfly
Their molecular cries
Chrysalis dreams waiting on the fifth instar
These stained glass wings can only take you so far

Tomorrow
There will come a time in the morning
There will be a sign from within
Stayin' with it through thick and thin
Butterfly, begin

Butterfly
(Butterfly, butterfly)
(Butterfly)

Tomorrow
There will be a sign from within
Stayin' with it through thick and thin
Butterfly, begin
Butterfly, begin

Butterfly, butterfly
Butterfly, butterfly
Butterfly, butterfly
You can be sure of it
Butterfly, butterfly
