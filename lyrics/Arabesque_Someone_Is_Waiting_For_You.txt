Someone is waiting for you
You better go now
And you may only come back to me
When you're free
Until then I'll be waitin' for you
Because I love you
But you may only come back to me
When you're free
Our love was like a fairy tale
Life was only sunshine to me
Until this letter in the mail
Made my heart cry
Thought I'd gonna die
Baby, don't deny
Someone is waiting for you
You better go now
And you may only come back to me
When you're free
Until then I'll be waitin' for you
Because I love you
But you may only come back to me
When you're free
Don't try to tell me that I'm wrong
There is someone waiting for you
You must find out where you belong
If you love her you must stay with her
Though I love you so
Someone is waiting for you
You better go now
And you may only come back to me
When you're free
Until then I'll be waitin' for you
Because I love you
But you may only come back to me
When you're free
Someone is waiting for you
You better go now (Go now)
Someone is waiting for you
You better go now (Go now)
Someone is waiting for you
You better go now (Go now)
Someone is waiting for you
You better go now (Go now)
