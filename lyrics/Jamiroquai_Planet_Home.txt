You know, there's no place like planet home
Nowhere else I'd rather be
It's the only place I know
Where you can witness tragedy
There's no time to wonder now
About who is right or wrong
We're gonna need some help to get things straight
So come on, bring your voice along
'Cause sure enough

There's no place like planet home
I wanna go now
If only we could make it right, planet home
I wanna go now

This bluest sphere of tattered dreams
Is headin' for destruction
Illusions drip from every seam
It's just death, war and corruption
I heard there was a promised land
On planet home
Two thousand years have been and gone
But still, we don't know
Can't you see that

There's no place like planet home
I wanna go now
If only we could make it right, planet home
I wanna go now (I wanna go there, baby)
Find yourself some peace on, planet home
I wanna go now
Anything's in reach on planet home
Planet home

Woo! No place like it!
Rrrr! Hoo, hoo!
Planet Home is blue and green, beautiful for you to see
Planet Home is blue and green, beautiful for you to see
Planet Home is blue and green, beautiful for you to see
Planet Home is blue and green...

I wanna go, now
I wanna go, now (Planet Home)
I wanna go there... (Planet Home)
There's no place like planet home
I wanna go, now
If only we could make it right, planet home
I wanna go, now (Hey, I really wanna go, now)
Find yourself some peace on planet home
I wanna go, now (I wanna go there, baby)
Anything's in reach on planet home (You know that anything's in reach on)
I wanna go, now (You know that there's no place like it)
