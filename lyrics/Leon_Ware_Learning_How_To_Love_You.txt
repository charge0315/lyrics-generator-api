Now, you're lying here
It's time for lovin'
Soft, blue knickers on
Back in the light
I've lived in sin
What you want, ooh, your own special place, yeah
Just like we can
Our love is the fuckin' highest, yeah

Oh I'm learning how to love you
Oh baby
I'm learning the way you like it
That's the spot, ooh

Touchin' you, touchin' me, ooh
It's alright, it's alright
Well
You cast a spell deep as a well
I think I've learned how to make you burn

Oh I'm learning how to love you
I fell down, way down, way down deeper
Had to get inside and love her
Sweeter, so much sweeter

Learning how to love you
I, oh I burnin' all those brightening spaces
Got to feelin' all those brightening spaces
Oh I'm learning how to love you
I, oh I got to...
