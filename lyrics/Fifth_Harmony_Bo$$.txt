Woo

Every day is payday
Swipe my card, then I do the Nae Nae
You're talking to a lady
I want a Kanye-ye, not a Ray J
So that's a no, no
I'm a Maybach and you's a Volvo
This convo beat like Dre-e
I already know what you tryna say, hey

You say that you a baller and I see you tryna holla
But that ain't how I was brought up, next
Workin' for the money 'cause that's what my mama taught me
So your ass better show me some respect
[Chorus: Normani &
All
]
BO$$, Michelle Obama
Purse all heavy, gettin' Oprah dollars
BO$$, Michelle Obama
Purse all heavy, gettin' Oprah dollars
BO$$, Michelle Obama
Purse all heavy, gettin' Oprah dollars
BO$$, Michelle Obama
Purse all heavy, gettin' Oprah dollars

C-O-N-F-I-D-E-N-T
That's me, I'm confident
Don't want yo' compliments, use common sense
I'm on my Michelle Obama
Shh, shut your mouth
Boy, I think you know who run this house
I ain't thirstin' for no bae
'Cause I already know what you tryna say, hey

You say that you a baller and I see you tryna holla
But that ain't how I was brought up, next
Workin' for the money 'cause that's what my mama taught me
So your ass better show me some respect
