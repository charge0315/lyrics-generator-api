Just let me hear some of that rock and roll music (Rock, roll, rock and roll)
Any old way you choose it (Rock, roll, rock and roll)
It's got a back beat, you can't lose it (Rock, roll, rock and roll)
Any old time you use it (Rock, roll, rock and roll)
It's got to be rock and roll music (Rock, roll, rock and roll)
If you want to dance with me
If you want to dance with me

I have no kicks against modern jazz
Unless they try to play it too darned fast
And change the beauty of the melody
Until it sounds just like a symphony

That's why I go for that rock and roll music (Rock, roll, rock and roll)
Any old way you choose it (Rock, roll, rock and roll)
It's got a back beat, you can't lose it (Rock, roll, rock and roll)
Any old time you use it (Rock, roll, rock and roll)
It's got to be rock and roll music (Rock, roll, rock and roll)
If you want to dance with me
If you want to dance with me

I took my loved one over 'cross the tracks
So she could hear my man a-wailing sax
I must admit they have a rocking band
Man, they was blowing like a hurricane

That's why I go for that rock and roll music (Rock, roll, rock and roll)
Any old way you choose it (Rock, roll, rock and roll)
It's got a back beat, you can't lose it (Rock, roll, rock and roll)
Any old time you use it (Rock, roll, rock and roll)
It's got to be rock and roll music (Rock, roll, rock and roll)
If you want to dance with me
If you want to dance with me

Way down south they gave a jubilee
I tell you folks they had a jamboree
And drinking beer from a wooden cup
The folks dancing got all shook up

They started playing that rock and roll music (Rock, roll, rock and roll)
Any old way you choose it (Rock, roll, rock and roll)
It's got a back beat, you can't lose it (Rock, roll, rock and roll)
Any old way you use it (Rock, roll, rock and roll)
It's got to be rock and roll music (Rock, roll, rock and roll)
If you want to dance with me
If you want to dance with me

Say, if you want to dance with me
(Rock)
If you want to dance with me
(Rock)
If you want to dance with me
It's got to be some of that (Rock)
If you wanna dance with me
