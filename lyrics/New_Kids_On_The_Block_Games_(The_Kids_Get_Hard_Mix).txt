No more games, it’s about positivity
And positivity is not about being soft
It’s about being smart
You sucker!
Ain’t it funky
Yeah, we’re gonna send this one out
To all those non-believers out there
Who been tryin’ to put us down and keep us down
For the past five years
I’m gonna tell you what
We ain’t goin’ out like that
You think this is a love song?
Wrong, the NKOTB is too strong

Games, games, games
Games, games
(Action!)

Somebody said somebody wouldn’t last too long
Somebody keep going strong
Games
Somebody said somebody was all a front
Somebody is still talking junk

Think of what you say
Think of what you do
Think of what you’re trying to put us through
We’re just singing a song
Games now!
When you put us down
It ain’t gonna get you nowhere
We’re positive
And no matter what you think we really care

Games!
Oh, ee, oh, oh, oh
Games, games, games
Oh, ee, oh, oh, oh
Games, games

Somebody said somebody worked too hard
Somebody gotta charm some hearts
Somebody said everybody’s gonna wait and see
What’s gonna be is gonna be
We don’t need your games

Think of what you say
Think of what you do
Think of what you’re trying to put us through
We’re just singing a song
When you put us down
It ain’t gonna get you nowhere
We’re positive
And no matter what you think we really care

Games
Oh, ee, oh, oh, oh
(Ain’t it funky)
Games, games, games
Oh, ee, oh, oh, oh
Games games
Oh, ee, oh, oh, oh
Games
Games, games, games
Oh, ee, oh, oh, oh
Games games
Games

No more games boy
So what you saying?
Beat the beatness ‘cause Donnie ain’t playin’
Witness the quickness as I kick this
I’m on a mission so listen as I dismiss
All this negativity by takin’ a stand
‘Cause we’re five bad brothers from the bean town land
No sell out, so get the hell out, we do it our way
Who gives a damn about what critics say?
Said we wouldn’t last, said our time will pass in just a flash
But we’re still kicking ass
The D-O-N-N-I-E, the W-A-H-L to the B-E-R-G
That’s funky
And now the games must cease
And to the non-believers I say peace
Stop playin’ those games, boy

Aah, yeah
Uh-uh
Ain’t it funky
We don’t need your games
Uh-huh
We don’t need your games
Word ‘em up
We don’t need your games
That’s right
Stop playin' those games
We don’t need your games
Word
We don’t need your games
Tell ‘em
We don’t need your, we don’t need your-
Stop playin’ those games

Na na na, na na na na
