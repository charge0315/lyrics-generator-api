I've never any time to play
It always seems to slip away
But it never really goes by
While I wait here with my lullaby
For our only try
Sing with your head up
With your eyes closed
Not because you love the song
Because you love to sing
Because you love to sing, oh
You saw frustration on my brow
You noticed I'm distracted now
I'm thinking only of my billfold
And how I want to face you with
Diamonds and gold in my head, in my hand
Sing with your head up
With your eyes closed
Not because you love the song
Because you love to sing
Because you love to sing
Sing with your head up
With your eyes closed
Not because you love the song
Because you love to sing
Because you love to sing, oh

Sing with your head up
With your eyes closed
Not because you love the song
Because you love to sing
Because you love to sing, oh
Sing with your head up
With your eyes closed
Not because you love the song
Because you love to sing
Because you love to sing, oh
