See that shiny plane up in the steel gray sky
Going faster than the speed of sound
It don't care about a thing, it just keeps passing by
Oblivious to everything's that down
If I was on a cloud then I could hitch a ride
That's how I would finally get to you
I'd grab onto the wing and at the perfect time
I'd open up my parachute
Sailing through the sky
Soaring way up high
When you think you've had enough of all this living on your own
And you feel you're just about to break in two
When you're stuck in overdrive and you're longing for home
It's time to change your attitude
Open up your parachute
See the raindrops pounding on my window pane
Tapping out their rhythms from above
They don't pay any mind to those alone within
Thinkin' 'bout the ones they love
Fifty-two floors up above the city lights
Stranded in my temporary nest
The hotel operator, she says, "Have a good night"
I lay down, close my eyes, and do my best
Fitful, sleepless nights
Dreaming I can fly
When you think you've had enough of all this living on your own
And you feel you're just about to break in two
When you're stuck in overdrive and you're longing for home
Come down to earth and change your mood
And open up your parachute
Fitful, sleepless nights
Dreaming I can fly
When you think you've had enough of all this living on your own
And you feel you're just about to break in two
When you're stuck in overdrive and you're longing for home
It's time to change your altitude
Open up your parachute
Come down to earth and change your mood
Open up your parachute
