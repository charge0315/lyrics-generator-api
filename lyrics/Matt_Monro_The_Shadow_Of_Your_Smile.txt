The shadow of your smile when you are gone
The color on my dreams and light the dawn
Look into my eyes my love and see
All the lovely things you are to me
Our wistful little star was far too high
A teardrop kissed your lips and so did I
Now when I remember spring
All the joy and love can bring
I will be remembering the shadow of your smile
