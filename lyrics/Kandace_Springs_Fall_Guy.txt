I will be your fall guy
You know I'd fall for you
Anything at all guy
Do what you want me to
If you'd just come over
I will cover for you
Be the secret lover
You'll swear you never knew
I will be your fall guy
You know I'd fall for you
I don't even know why
Something I gotta do
If you'll just come over
I'll say it's all my fault
I don't care
If you don't care at all

Cause I'll be there
When you finally hit the ground
I'll be there
When you finally come around
Make you land so soft
You won't even hear a sound
I will be your fall guy

I will be your fall guy
You know I understand
Just tell me a good lie
I'll be your backup plan
If you'll just come over
I will cover for you
Be the secret lover
You'll swear you never knew

Cause I'll be there
When you finally hit the ground
I'll be there
When you finally come around
Make you land so soft
You won't even hear a sound
I will be your fall guy
I will be your fall guy

I don't even know why
I don't even know why

But I'll be there
When you finally hit the ground
I'll be there
When you finally come around
Make you land so soft
You won't even hear a sound
I will be your fall guy
I will be your fall guy
I will be your fall guy
