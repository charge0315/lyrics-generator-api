How can I make you mine, if I had the sweetest kind
I can sugar brush you in my arms, you're my love divine
I'm your Willy Wonka, golden ticket is yours
Don't you waste, not one taste, from my ladle it pours
They say the sweetness you’ll eat up, but the bitter is betta
Takin' bites from the box, you never know what you getta
But you keep trying and trying, 'cause the flavor is fun
So many variations from the contents of one
Where the drums?

So what's the deal? Are you gay or popping pills?
Why you still wanna take my hand?
This discotheque is about to make me a wreck
My feet are singing louder than the band
I see you got the feeling, flashing lights up on the ceiling
Say you gotta get your weekend now
What difference does it make?
You know you can't make chocolate cake
If ain't nobody ever showed you how
