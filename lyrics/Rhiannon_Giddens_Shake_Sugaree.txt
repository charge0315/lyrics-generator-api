Have a little song, won't take long
Sing it right, once or twice
Oh Lordy me, didn't I shake sugaree?
Everything I got is done and pawned
Everything I got is done and pawned

Pawn my watch, pawn my chain
Pawn everything that was in my name
Oh Lordy me, didn't I shake sugaree?
Everything I got is done and pawned
Everything I got is done and pawned

Pawn my chair, pawn my bed
Ain't got nowhere to lay my head
Oh Lordy me, didn't I shake sugaree?
Everything I got is done and pawned
Everything I got is done and pawned

Pawn my tobacco, pawn my bike
Pawned everything that was in my sight
Oh Lordy me, didn't I shake sugaree?
Everything I got is done and pawned
Everything I got is done and pawned

Have a little secret, ain't gonna tell
I'm goin' to Heaven in a brown pea shell
Oh Lordy me, didn't I shake sugaree?
Everything I got is done and pawned
Everything I got is done and pawned

Have a little secret, ain't gonna tell
I'm goin' to Heaven in a brown pea shell
Oh Lordy me, didn't I shake sugaree?
Everything I got is done and pawned
Everything I got is done and pawned
