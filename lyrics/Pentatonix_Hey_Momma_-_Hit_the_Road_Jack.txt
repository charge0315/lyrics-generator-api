All my gentlemen, let me see you
My independent women, let me see you
All my gentlemen, let me see you
My independent women, let me see you

Hey momma, I don't want no drama
But the way you look be makin' me smile
Hey baby, I know you are a lady
But your moves - your dress
Girl I'm likin' your style
I know that you don't wanna be bothered
But baby you make me wanna holler
You know that I am into you
Why you got to say

Hit the road, Jack, and don't you come back
No more, no more, no more, no more
Hit the road, Jack, and don't you come back no more
(Don't come back no more, no more)
Hit the road, Jack, and don't you come back
No more, no more, no more, no more
Hit the road, Jack, and don't you come back no more

All my gentlemen, let me see you
My independent women, let me see you (let me see you)
All my gentlemen, let me see you
My independent women, let me see you

Hey momma, I know you got a problem
Cause the men back then had been all wrong
Hey baby, I know I'm kinda crazy
But beside me is where you belong
Just to let you know I'll make you feel better
Make you up, be the only one forever
Take me back a chance, let me be your man
Why you got to say

Hit the road Jack, and don't you come back
No more, no more, no more, no more
Hit the road Jack, and don't you come back no more
(Don't come back no more)
Hit the road Jack, and don't you come back
No more, no more, no more, no more
Hit the road Jack, and don't you come back no more (That's right)
Don't you come back no more (Oh tell him)
Don't you come back no more (That's right)
Don't you come back no more (Don't you come back no more)

Old woman, old woman, don't you treat me so mean
You're the meanest old woman that I ever did see
(Don't care, I don't care)
What'cha mean you don't care
(You know exactly what I mean)
Oh baby, listen baby, don't you treat me this way (Oh oh)
I'll be back on my feet someday
(Yeah right, every man say)
Oh baby I mean it
No, there ain't nothin' you can say
I guess if you say so
I'll have to pack my things and go
I guess if you say so
I'll have to pack my things and go

Hit the road, hit road
Hit the road Jack, Jack (ah aah)
Hit, hit the road

Hit the road, Jack, and don't you come back
No more, no more, no more, no more
Hit the road, Jack, and don't you come back no more
(Don't come back no more)
Hit the road, Jack, and don't you come back
No more, no more, no more, no more
Hit the road, Jack, and don't you come back no more (That's right)
