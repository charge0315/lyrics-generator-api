When I was young
I used to play
On the sand by the bay
What I've got now
I'd give it all away
Just to have some fun
Life was all
I had a ship
And sailed it to the end
Why can't I go there again

Take me back to then
When life was mellow
Where we had golden sun
Take me back, I said
I can't continue
With the world I'm in

Playing in the park
Every afternoon
I've grown old
Far too soon
Someone please tell me why
I can't be made to see
What good's left in my life
Is this the end of me
There's a tear
For all the dreams
That I left behind
They'll always be on my mind
 X2
Take me back to then
When life was mellow
Where we had golden sun
Take me back, I said
I can't continue
With the world I'm in
