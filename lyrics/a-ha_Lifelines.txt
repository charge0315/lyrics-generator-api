One time to know that it's real
One time to know how it feels, that's all
One call, your voice on the phone
One place, a moment alone, that's all

What do you see? What do you know?
What are the signs? What do I do?
Just follow your lifeline through
What if it hurts? What then?
What do we do? What do you say?
Don't throw your lifelines away
Don't throw your lifelines away

One time, just once in my life, yeah
One time to know it can happen twice
One shot of a clear blue sky
One look, I see no reasons why we can't

One chance to go back to the point where everything starts
One chance to keep it together when things fall apart
One sign to make us believe it's true

What do you see? Where do we go?
What are the signs? What do I do?
By letting your lifelines show
What if we do? What now?
What do you say? How do I know?
Don't let your lifeline go
Don't let your lifeline go
Hah-ha
Don't let your lifeline go
