No catch, no strings
None of the usual things
I'm happy just to lay and look
Let's throw out the book
Now we're off the hook
And please
Be nice to me
Be nice to me
So tired, so sad
So sick of being had
By everyone who comes along
Would it be so wrong
If you played along
And please
Be nice to me
It's been a long, long time since I felt so fine
Be nice to me
And would it bring you down if I hang around
I know your love is fine
I know what's on your mind but
Don't laugh, don't cry
Don't make me wonder why
You're doing what you're doing now
Can't you see somehow
It's the wrong time now
So please
Be nice to me
(Nice to me...)
Be nice to me
It's been a long, long time since I felt so fine
Be nice to me
It's been a long, long time since I felt so fine
Be nice to me
Be nice to me
Be nice to me
Be nice to me
La la la la la, no catch
La la la la la, no strings
