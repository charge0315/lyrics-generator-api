Listen to me, if you wanna be free
You gotta let it go
Just let it go
'Cause people can stab you in the back
Right out of the blue
No, you just don't know people
Or what they're gonna do

You can't control
You can't keep hold of anything in this world

So take a little walk in the sunshine
Count one, two, three
Baby, stay with me
Take a little walk in the sunshine
And listen to your heartbeat

Listen to me
I know it's hard to believe
But you can let it go
Just let it go
'Cause people can give you a heart attack
Right out of the blue
No, you just don't know people
Or what they're gonna do

You can't control
You can't keep hold of anything in this world

So take a little walk in the sunshine
Count one, two, three
Baby, stay with me
Take a little walk in the sunshine
And listen to your heartbeat

I can't believe
That I've stopped believing in people
When I've always had faith
All of my life
I don't know how to overcome this mistrust
I'm out of faith
Oh Lord, restore my faith

Most people are kind
Most people are good
And there's people out there
Who are just misunderstood
There's people that are wise
People that do right
And there's people out there
That you just don't know
(Take a little walk in the sunshine)
Most people are kind
Most people are good
And there's people out there
Who are just misunderstood
(Take a little walk in the sunshine)
There's people that are wise
There's people that do right
And there's people out there
That you just don't know
(Most people are kind)
Most people are kind
(Most people don't lie)
Most people are good
(Most people are kind)
And there's people out there
(Just stay holding on to me)
There's people that are wise
There's people that do right
And there's people out there
That you just don't know
(Most people are kind)
Most people are kind
(Most people don't lie)
Most people are good
(Most people are kind)
And there's people out there
(Just stay holding on to me)
There's people that are wise
There's people that do right
And there's people out there
That you just don't know
