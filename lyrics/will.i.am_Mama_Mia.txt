When you gonna stop breaking my heart?
I don't wanna be another one
Paying for the things I never done
Don't let go
¿Dónde voy?
Don't let go to my love
¿Dónde voy sin tu amor?

We runned that city

Can I get to your soul?
Can you get to my flow?
Can we promise we won't let go?
All the things that I need
All the things that you need
You can make it feel so real

'Cause you can't deny, you've blown my mind
When I touch your body, I'm fucking losing control
'Cause you can't deny, you've blown my mind
When I see you, baby, I just don't wanna let go

Simply
We runned that city
Our competition is not
¡El Orfanato!
You heard it?
The end
We the best!

I hate to see you cry, your smile is a beautiful lie
I hate to see you cry, my love is dying inside

No, no debes llorar
Amor, sigue tu rumbo que lo nuestro acabó (Acabó)
No más, no volveré atrás
Con el corazón roto te deseo lo mejor
(D-D, -DO!)

Can I get to your soul?
Can you get to my flow?
Can we promise we won't let go?
All the things that I need
All the things that you need
You can make it feel so real

'Cause you can't deny, you've blown my mind
When I touch your body, I'm fucking losing control
'Cause you can't deny, you've blown my mind
When I see you, baby, I just don't wanna let go

When you gonna stop breaking my heart?
Don't let go
¿Dónde voy?
Don't let go to my love
¿Dónde voy sin tu amor?

I hate to see you cry, your smile is a beautiful lie
I hate to see you cry, my love is dying inside

No, no debes llorar
Amor, sigue tu rumbo que lo nuestro acabó (Acabó)
No más, no volveré atrás
Con el corazón roto te deseo lo mejor

I can fix all those lies
Oh baby, baby, I run, but I'm running to you
You won't see me cry, I'm hiding inside
My heart is in pain, but I'm smiling for you
Oh baby I'll try to make the things right
I need you more than air when I'm not with you
Please don't ask me why, just kiss me this time
My only dream is about you and I
