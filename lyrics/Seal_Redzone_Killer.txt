Let me tell you a bit about the scene
She’s living in a private movie
Ego higher than a oscar high
Am I the one stupid if she thinks that she can fly
My oh my
In her head and so the cycle goes
But she’s never really on her own
Now there’s ten deals blowing up the telephone
They won’t stop ringing ‘till theres no one home
She’s long gone
You crave it you make it
Not what you had i mind ok
If you hate it don’t say it
Just keep the dream alive today
And just pray
You stepped over their lifeless bodies
Finding fame bright lights and money
Your a redzone killer redzone killer
Not evil
Redzone killer redzone killer
Just ruthless
More green than Ive ever seen
Mama that beast got a hold of me
Now I’m colder than I’ve ever known
Surrounded by people yet I feel I’m on my own
Ohh no no
While you were dreamin’
Now Here’s the ending that I think you know
A fool running for a crock of gold
No she’s tongue tied talking to the telephone
End of this story you see she got sold
Or just old
You crave it you make it
Not what you had in mind ok
If you hate it don’t say it
Just keep the dream alive today
(they won’t miss you)
And just pray
(they won’t miss you)
‘Cos you stepped over their lifeless bodies
Finding fame bright lights and money
Your a redzone killer redzone killer
You’re fearless
Redzone killer redzone killer
Just ruthless
You carry the weight of the world with his arm on your shoulder
Your man he can wait its your heart getting colder
Redzone killer, redzone killer
She can dream all over the world
But dreams don’t care about girls
She can dream all over the world
But dreams don’t care about girls
