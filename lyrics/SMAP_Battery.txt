Wu-Tang Clan, how my angels get up
Life on life, tell me how yours set up
Nigga ask me how I'm doin' this year

Come here lil' bitch, I ain't done lil' bitch, one of one lil' bitch, ain't nothin' like me
Open your eyes for a second, I'm the high-end legend, I'm the guidance that you need
Rollin' on sevens on the regular, now I don't think you ready for the revolution that I bring
One shot, two shot, three shot, four shot
Fountain of youth thought- (hol' up, pow-pow)

Images, virus, limitless, priceless
Somewhere energy shining
Eyes shut, silence
No brightness, it's skyless

I been holdin', ever
I been wakin' up
I dont know if you're my answer
But I hold you back, know you hold me back
I don't know that it's ever
And I feel it forever
How it makes you feel better
How it makes you feel, how makes it feel
'Cause I been wonderin' 'bout you
And you been wonderin', please
And I been thinkin' 'bout all that
Just everything I feel, oh
Even if I don't care, bae, yeah
Even if you don't know, oh
You been livin' on a highway
Just don't let that feeling go

How many y'all go up?
How many y'all don't holla at the wall
But they energy not like us
Half of you niggas just suck
How the fuck niggas still ain't grown up
When they 32 plus
And they live month to month
Fuck, Uber, jets, pick
Acting like a hairbrush
Nigga I'm disgusted
I ain't gotta say that I'm bout to move different
So I could move different
I don't give a fuck if it's ten billionaires right here
Man, fuck that pitch
If I don't know I'll regress my soul from you
And I don't know what else to know from you
And I don't know what else controllin' you
Hah hah hah hah

Made lotta money but it's not for me
Might give it all away like Jack Dorsey
Every gun been straight and the babies don't need
Uh huh
Buy more land, 'cause we never had land
Trust me put blood in my estate plans
I'ma keep it a buck, I'm a 5 star brand
Uh huh
Killstreaks, 5 links
All plated gold
Isolation just to clear my soul
Last year, make or break
Bad year
The evils was around
But didn't last here
