Here we go again with all this, like why we can’t never get this right?
Yo, what you talkin' 'bout, man?
Man, it's sickening (Here we go)
Yo, where you think you going
What you mean where I’m goin'? (Going through the same things)
You heard me
Man, whatever
Yo, come here, man
(Here we go) Over and over again, it's the same story, man
What you mean over and over again?
Come on, man, what you talkin' about?
(Going through the same things)

I shoulda never let you see me cry
I’ll be sittin' up thinkin', I’ll be thinkin' about
What I’m gonna do, knowin' I should just leave you alone
Let go and move on (Just leave you alone)
It's same ol' things, just another day
And the minute I’m gone, is when you need me (Same ol' thing)
Couldn’t get you to act right (That's when need me)
But now you go gettin' everything tight
I don't wanna play games (No)
Why can't you do right? (Make you do right)
Why can’t you love me? (Love me, yeah)
The way it's suppose to be, yeah, yeah

Here we go (Here we go), goin' through the same things
Over and over and over again, yeah
Here we go (Here we go), goin' through the same things
Over and over and over again
