You can never know
What's sleeping in someone else's mind
Looking at you I hope to find
What's happening in your head
Deep beneath the ice
May beat another nature's heart
Baby what's keeping us apart
Is what we haven't said
What's on your mind?
Are you looking for somebody new
What's on your mind?
Have you seen the way I look at you
If you don't let it show
We may never know
Just what's on your mind
Hey hey ay
Sometimes you can tell
It doesn't always take that long
Baby I don't think I'm wrong
Looking at you tonight
Somethings going on
I can feel it coming through
And I think you feel it too
Tell me that I'm right
What's on your mind?
Are you looking for somebody new
What's on your mind?
Have you seen the way I look at you
If you don't let it show
We may never know
Just what's on your mind
(Guitar solo and scat)
If you don't let it show
We may never know
Just what's on your mind
What's on your mind?
Are you looking for somebody new
What's on your mind?
Have you seen the way I look at you
What's on your mind?
Are you looking for somebody new
What's on your mind?
Have you seen the way I look at you
