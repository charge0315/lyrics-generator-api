Ready or not, here I come, you can't hide
Gonna find you and keep you happy
Ready or not, here I come, you can't hide
Gonna love you and make you love me

You can't run away
From this love I got, oh baby
Hey baby, 'cause I got a lot, yeah
Anywhere you go
My poor heart's gotta know, oh baby
Hey baby, you can't hide from my love, no

Ready or not, here I come, you can't hide
Gonna find you and keep you happy
Ready or not, here I come, you can't hide
Gonna love you and make you love me

Anywhere you go
My poor heart's gotta know, baby
Hey baby, you can't hide from my love, no

Ready or not, here I come, you can't hide
Gonna find you and keep you happy
Ready or not, here I come, you can't hide
