Let's go surfing now
Everybody's learning how
Come on and safari with me
Come on and safari with me

Early in the morning, we'll be starting out
Some honeys will be coming along
We're loading up our Woody with our boards inside
And heading out singing our song

Come on (Surfer), baby, wait and see (Surfing safari)
Yes, I'm going to (Surfer) take you surfing (Surfing safari) with me
Come along (Surfer), baby, wait and see (Surfing safari)
Yes, I'm going to (Surfer) take you surfing (Surfing safari) with me
Let's go surfing now
Everybody's learning how
Come on and safari with me
Come on and safari with me

At Huntington and Malibu, they're shooting the pier
At Rincon, they're walking the nose
We're going on safari to the islands this year
So if you're coming, get ready to go

Come on (Surfer), baby, wait and see (Surfing safari)
Yes, I'm going to (Surfer) take you surfing (Surfing safari) with me
Come along (Surfer), baby, wait and see (Surfing safari)
Yes, I'm going to (Surfer) take you surfing (Surfing safari) with me
Let's go surfing now
Everybody's learning how
Come on and safari with me
Come on and safari with me

They're angling in Laguna in Cerro Azul
They're kicking out in Doheny, too
I tell you, surfing's mighty wild, it's getting bigger every day
From Hawaii to the shores of Peru

Come on (Surfer), baby, wait and see (Surfing safari)
Yes, I'm going to (Surfer) take you surfing (Surfing safari) with me
Come along (Surfer), baby, wait and see (Surfing safari)
Yes, I'm going to (Surfer) take you surfing (Surfing safari) with me
Let's go surfing now
Everybody's learning how
Come on and safari with me
Come on and safari with me
