Da-da, da-da, da-da, da-da-da

Gray skies are gonna clear up
Put on a happy face
Brush off those clouds and cheer up (You got it)
Put on a happy face

And take off the gloomy mask of tragedy (And)
It's not your style (Ah, it's not your style)
You'll look so good that you'll be glad
You decided to smile, darling

Pick out a pleasant outlook (Okay)
Stick out that noble chin (Get out of town)
Wipe off that "full of doubt" look
Slap on a happy grin, hahaha

And spread sunshine all over the place (Do-do-da)
Put on a happy face
Take it, uh huh
Put on a happy face
Just on a happy face
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da
Da-da
Yeah, yeah, yeah, na
Ba-na-na-ho-fay

Gray skies are gonna clear up
Put on a happy face
Brush off those clouds and cheer up (Cheer up)
Put on a happy face (And upper lip)

And if you're feeling cross and bitterish
Don't sit and whine
Just think about banana splits and licorice
You'll feel fine

We knew a girl so gloomy
She'd never laugh or sing (I knew that girl)
Haha, she never listened to me
And now she's a mean old thing (She's mean)

So spread, so spread sunshine all over the place (Please)
And just put on a happy face
Put on a happy face (Da-da-do)
Da-da, da-da, da-da, da-da-da
Da-da, da-da, da-da, da-da-da
Da-da, da-da, da-da, da-da-da (Ah, yes)
Da-da, da-da, da-da, da-da-da (Put on a happy face)
Da-da, da-da, da-da, da-da-da (A happy face)
You did it (Ah, and it is so fine)
Da-da, da-da, da-da, da-da-da
Da-do-da, da-do-da
Da-do-da, da-do-da
Da-do-da, da-do-da
