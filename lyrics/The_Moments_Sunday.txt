I was feelin’ sad
About another year
And now it’s gone
I took time for granted
When we were young
We wanted more
What we didn’t know was that
We had everything
But it wouldn’t last we were growing up
We wanted more its not enough
What we didn’t know was
You can’t get back the years so
Times too short don’t lie
Why you wanna go and die?
So…
Don’t forget to chase the moments
As they come,  one day they’re gone
Don’t forget to chase the moments
As they come,  one day they’re gone
I think I’m freaking out another panic attack
I’m too high from these pills I’ve been taking
Anything to help me through this
To get outta my head and on the right track
Start acting my age, I wish I could go
Back and do it all again
But it wouldn’t last we were growing up
We wanted more its not enough
What we didn’t know was
You can’t get back the years so
Times too short don’t lie
Why you wanna go and die?
So…
Don’t forget to chase the moments
As they come,  one day they’re gone
Don’t forget to chase the moments
As they come,  one day they’re gone
Just open your eyes
Just open your eyes
I wanna get outta here
I’m getting outta here
I wanna get outta here
I’m getting outta here
I wanna get outta here
I’m getting outta here
I wanna get outta here
I’m getting outta here
Don’t forget to chase the moments
As they come, one day they’re gone
Don’t forget to chase the moments
As they come,  one day they’re gone
Times too short don’t lie
Why you wanna go and die?
