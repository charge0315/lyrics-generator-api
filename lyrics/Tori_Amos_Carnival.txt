I'll sing to the sun in the sky
I'll sing to the sun rising high

Carnival time is here
Magical time of year
And as the time draws near
Dreams fill my heart

I'll sing while he plays his guitar
I'll sing as the night wakes the dawn
Will love come my way
On this magical day?
And will love stay in my heart?

Carnival time is here
Magical time I'm near
And as the time draws near
Dreams fill my heart

I sing while he plays his guitar
I sing in my dream from afar
Will love come my way
On this magical day?
And will love stay in my heart?

Will true love come my way
On this magical day?
Or will love only live in my...
Stay in me
Stay in me
Stay in me
You
You, my heart

I said I say it again
The way you walk and I know the way you can
The way you're telling me you're not a dangerous man
I said it again, I say again
I'm not that kind of woman
The way you're telling me wha-what you can do
What you can
You
You
