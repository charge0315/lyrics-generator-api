D-N-C-E, D-N-C-E, D-N-C-E, D-N-C-E, dance
Okay, see if you can catch up, hey

Sippin' on a bottle 'til the bottle's starin' back at you (Woo-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Back against the wall, 'til the poison makes my body move (Woo-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)

If he can and she can, then they can get weird together
If he can and she can, then we can be weird forever
Sippin' on a bottle 'til the bottle's starin' back at you (Woo-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)

This ain't fire, but it burns my throat
This ain't water, but it floats my boat
Put your feet above your hands and D-N-C-E, dance

Woo, if you ain't leavin' (
Dance

You better

Don't fight the feelin' now (

You better

Sippin' and I'm slippin' even further into make-believe (Eee-eee-eee-eee-eee-eee-eee)
Whiskey got me wishin' that you'd come D-N-C-E with me (Eee-eee-eee-eee-eee-eee-eee)

If he can and she can, then they can get weird together
If he can and she can then we can be weird forever
Sippin' and I'm slippin' even further into make-believe (Eee-eee-eee-eee-eee-eee-eee)

This ain't fire, but it burns my throat
This ain't water, but it floats my boat
Put your feet above your hands and D-N-C-E, dance

Woo, if you ain't leavin' (
Dance
)
You better

Don't fight the feelin' now (

Step left foot, then the other foot (

Wave right hand, then the other hand (

Shake your head like you don't understand
How to dance, how to dance, how to
