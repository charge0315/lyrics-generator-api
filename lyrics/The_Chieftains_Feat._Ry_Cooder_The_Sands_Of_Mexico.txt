We went down to Churubusco
But the devil got there first
The road was hard, the way was long
Churubusco was far worse
Pressed in the Union Army
And ordered off to go
Along the southern border
To the sands of Mexico

Now we come from Cork and Kerry
That emerald world has past
My Mary would be pleased to know
I'm a praying man at last
In this distressed country
Little comfort do we know
My Bible is my road map
On the sands of Mexico

When the roll is called up yonder
I'll be there
The boys will harmonize
A lovely Irish air
Take a message to my Mary
She's the one that's true I know
When you saw me I had fallen
On the sands of Mexico

Now the army used us harshly
We were but trash to them
Conscripted Irish farmers
Not first class soldier men
They beat us and they banged us
Mistreated us, you know
But they couldn't make us killers
On the sands of Mexico

That's why we call it faith
That's why we call Him Lord
That's why I threw away my Yankee sword
Our John Riley seized the day
And marched us down the road
And we wouldn't slay our brothers
On the sands of Mexico

Faith and righteousness was all in vain
Irish blood was spilled once again
As I stand upon the gallows
It cheers the soul to know
History will absolve us
On the sands of Mexico

The sands of Mexico
The bloody sands of Mexico
La historia me absolverá
On the sands of Mexico
