When the lights are down
And the stage is bare
And no more magic's in the air
There's not a friend in sight to care
Your tears no one will share

I'll be your comfort through your pain
I'll be your shelter in the rain

When your sad is bad and your bad is worst
And there's no who to turn to first
When you've done everything you can
No one's there to take your hand

I'll be your comfort through your pain
I'll be your shelter in the rain

When you've looked around
You haven't seen me anywhere
Though when you were down
I lifted you up from there
There isn't a thing you can ask of me
I won't do
Just you put your trust in me
My love will see you through

When the final candle's flickered out
"Why me" is all you can think about
When all your joy has disappeared
Your future isn't clear

I'll be your comfort through your pain
I'll be your shelter in the rain

When all the odds say there's no chance
Admit the final dance
I'll be you comfort through your pain
I'll be your shelter in the rain
I'll be you comfort through your pain
Yes, i'll be your shelter in the rain, rain
I'll be your shelter
Be your shelter, be your shelter in the rain
