What if another universe, complete with sun and moon
An entire galaxy and, what's worse, you and I too soon
Find each other expanding beyond this dirty room
Butterscotch mountains, sunshine

Boom, boom, boom
Boom, boom

Run your fingers up and down the obelisk in the earth
Down to 33 RPMs where the primordial gives birth
Or else we lie neck high, you and I in one another's grooves
Volcano magic, sometimes we go

Boom, boom, boom
Boom, boom

Everybody knows what happens when you worship from afar
The ebb and flow of angels dancing around the star
And if the sunrise is still in question, the answer's in the dark
Celibate mushroom canopy

Boom, boom, boom
Boom, boom
