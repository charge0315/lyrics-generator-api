Here in my room, having visions of you
Over and over again, my love
'Cause when I look in your eyes, girl
I'm so mesmerized
Such beauty that's so deep
Within your soul
You were my friend from the start
You have captured my heart
I'm so excited
I'm ready to love you
(Carry me carefully)
I'm in a whirlwind
(Whirlwind, whirlwind)
When dancing with you
(Dancing with you)
It's like I loved you
(It's like I loved you)
Before I met you
I'm under your spell
(Under, under your spell)
It's a magical night
(Magic)
Kissing you, loving you
Holding you tight
Inside my mind my thoughts drift to you
Hoping and praying my dreams come true
Yet, I can't help but wonder
If you're feeling me, too
I'm constantly thinking of you
You were my friend from the start
I will take care of your heart
I am so ready
Excited to show you
(Carry me carefully)
I'm in a whirlwind
(Whirlwind, whirlwind)
When I am with you
(When I'm with you)
It's like I loved you
(It's like I loved you)
Before I met you
I'm under your spell
(Under, under your spell)
It's a magical night
(Magic)
Kissing you, loving you
Holding you tight
Now that I have you right here in my arms
I'm here to stay, it's you and me, and we'll never part
You know love can't be taught
Because love, it's a gift
We are here to edify each other day and night
Give support and never, ever quit
I knew from the start
Darling, that you had my heart
You were my lover, my best friend, my future, my wife
Together we will frame the rest of our lives
