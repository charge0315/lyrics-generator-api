Today, I don't feel like doin' anything
I just wanna lay in my bed
Don't feel like pickin' up my phone
So leave a message at the tone
'Cause today, I swear, I'm not doin' anything, uh

I'm gonna kick my feet up, then stare at the fan
Turn the TV on, throw my hand in my pants
Nobody's gon' tell me I can't, nah
I'll be loungin' on the couch, just chillin' in my Snuggie
Click to MTV, so they can teach me how to dougie
'Cause in my castle, I'm the freakin' man

Oh-oh, yes I said it, I said it (Ooh)
I said it, 'cause I can (Ooh)

Today, I don't feel like doin' anything
I just wanna lay in my bed
Don't feel like pickin' up my phone
So leave a message at the tone
'Cause today, I swear, I'm not doin' anything

Nothin' at all
Woo-hoo, woo-hoo, ooh
Nothin' at all
Woo-hoo, woo-hoo, ooh

Tomorrow, I'll wake up, do some P90X
Meet a really nice girl, have some really nice sex
And she's gonna scream out, "This is great" (Oh my God, this is great)
Yeah, I might mess around and get my college degree
I bet my old man will be so proud of me
But sorry, pops, you'll just have to wait

Oh-oh, yes I said it, I said it (Ooh)
I said it, 'cause I can (Ooh)

Today, I don't feel like doin' anything
I just wanna lay in my bed
Don't feel like pickin' up my phone
So leave a message at the tone
'Cause today, I swear, I'm not doin' anything

No, I ain't gonna comb my hair (Ooh)
'Cause I ain't goin' anywhere
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
I'll just strut in my birthday suit (Ooh)
And let everything hang loose
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Oh, today, I don't feel like doin' anything
I just wanna lay in my bed
Don't feel like pickin' up my phone
So leave a message at the tone
'Cause today, I swear, I'm not doin' anything

Nothin' at all
Woo-hoo, woo-hoo, ooh
Nothin' at all
Woo-hoo, woo-hoo, ooh
Nothin' at all
