She'll only come out at night
The lean and hungry type
Nothing is new, I've seen her here before
Watching and waiting
Ooh, she's sitting with you, but her eyes are on the door
So many have paid to see
What you think you're getting for free
The woman is wild, a she-cat tamed by the purr of a Jaguar
Money's the matter
If you're in it for love, you ain't gonna get too far

Oh-oh, here she comes
Watch out, boy, she'll chew you up
Oh-oh, here she comes
She's a man-eater
Oh-oh, here she comes
Watch out, boy, she'll chew you up
Oh-oh, here she comes
She's a man-eater (Uh-huh)

I wouldn't if I were you
I know what she can do
She's deadly, man, and she could really rip your world apart
Mind over matter
Ooh, the beauty is there, but a beast is in the heart

Oh-oh, here she comes
Watch out, boy, she'll chew you up
Oh-oh, here she comes
She's a man-eater
Oh-oh, here she comes
Watch out, boy, she'll chew you up
Oh-oh, here she comes
She's a man-eater (Uh-huh)

(Hey)
Ooh

Woah-oh, here she comes (Here she comes)
Watch out, boy, she'll chew you up
Woah-oh, here she comes (Watch out)
She's a man-eater
Woah-oh, here she comes (She's a man-eater)
Ooh, she'll chew you up
(Oh-oh, here she comes)
Here she comes, she's a man-eater
Oh-oh, here she comes (Watch out)
She'll only come out at night, ooh
(Oh-oh, here she comes)
Here she comes, she's a man-eater, ooh
(Oh-oh, here she comes, she's a man-eater)
The woman is wild, woo
(Oh-oh, here she comes)
Here she comes, watch out, boy, watch out, boy
(Oh-oh, here she comes)
Oh, watch out, watch out, watch out, watch out
(Oh-oh, here she comes, watch out)
Yeah, yeah, she's a man-eater
(Oh-oh, here she comes, she's a man-eater)
She's watching and waiting, ooh
(Oh-oh, here she comes)
Oh, she's a man-eater
