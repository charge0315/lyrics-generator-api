There's a saying old
Says that love is blind
Still we're often told:
'Seek and ye shall find";
So I'd to find a certain lad
I've had
In mind

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he
Turns out to be
Someone to watch over me

I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could
Always be good
To one who'd watch over me

Although he may not be the man some
Girls think of
As handsome
To my heart
He'll carry the key

Won't you tell him please to put on some speed
Follow my lead
Oh, how I need
Someone to watch over me
