We travel 'round the world
Making music from our hearts
To bring to you with love
It's the universal language
And we deliver it on time
Blow your mind
In a world that's so corrupted
Where the dollar makes the choice
We really don't care
It's all about soul
We're hooked on soul
Hooked on soul
And the horns say
We're hooked on soul
Hooked on soul
And the horns say
If you keep yourself from drinkin'
Then maybe you'll start thinkin'
You'll feel soul (Solid gold)
Voices talk equality
Universal family of soul (Gotta stroll)
Why do we keep on searching?
It's been here all along
The thing called soul (Sing the song)
Hooked on soul (Sing along)
And the horns say
Hooked on soul
Hooked on soul
And the horns say
Soul, we're hooked on soul
Hooked on soul
Hooked on soul
Why do we keep on searching?
It's been here all along
The thing called soul (Sing the song)
Hooked on soul (Sing along)
And the horns say
We're hooked on soul
Hooked on
And the horns say
Hooked on
Hooked on soul
Hooked on
Tell me you remember
Dancing in September, everyday
Everybody's bumpin'
Can't you hear the speakers thumpin'?
