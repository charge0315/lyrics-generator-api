Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

You could say I lost my faith in science and progress, yeah
You could say I lost my belief in the holy church
You could say I lost my sense of direction
You could say all of this and worse but

If I ever lose my faith in you
There'd be nothing left for me to do

Some would say I was a, a lost man in a lost world
You could say I lost my faith in the people on TV
You could say I lost my belief in our politicians (Oh yeah)
They all seem like game show hosts to me

If I ever lose my faith in you
There'd be nothing left for me to do
(Hey hey, hey hey)

I could be lost inside their lies
Without a trace
But every time I close my eyes
I see your face

I never saw no miracle of science
That didn't go from a blessing to a curse
I never saw no military solution
That didn't always end up as something worse but
Let me say this first

If I ever lose my faith in you
There'd be nothing left for me to do
If I ever lose my faith
If I ever lose my faith
If I ever lose my faith
If I ever lose my faith
In you

Never ever lose my faith
Never ever lose my faith in you
Ooh
Mmm, never ever lose my faith in
Never ever lose my faith in you
No
No
Never ever lose my faith in you
Never ever lose my faith in you yeah
Never ever lose my faith in you yeah
Never ever lose my, lose my faith in you, yeah
