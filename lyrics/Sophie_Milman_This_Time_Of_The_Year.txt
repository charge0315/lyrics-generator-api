Little girls and little boys
Dream of a world full of toys
This time of the year
When Christmas is near

Evergreens are snowy white
Sleigh bells ringing through the night
This time of the year
When Christmas is near

And somewhere there are steeples
People kneel and pray
And a choir sings carols
Of Christmas Day

Santa Claus is on his way
With loads of joy on his sleigh
This time of the year
When Christmas is near

And somewhere there are steeples
People kneel and pray
While a choir sings carols
Of Christmas Day

Ooh, Santa Claus is on his way
With loads of joy on his sleigh
This time of the year
When Christmas is near
When Christmas is near
