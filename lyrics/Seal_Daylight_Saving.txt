Daylight save me all my head like I’ve had enough
Of all the changes I’ve been through lately
Daylight save me again ‘cos I feel like giving up
On all of the places I’ve been to lately
You and I were like the weather
You and I, like sun and rain
White flag I surrender
Maybe now we’ll find a way
But we’re not still together
Daylight save me again ‘cos I  know I can’t keep it up
With all the faces I see through lately
It’s cold at night when I lie in bed
I’m not big enough to warm the space beside that you left me
You and I were like the weather
You and I like sun and rain
We deny it when you’re loosing me I’m loosing you
Maybe now we’ll find a way
But we’re not still together
We’re not the same
‘Cos nothing lasts forever
Been so long
You and I were like the weather
You and I like sun and rain
We deny it when you’re loosing me I’m loosing you
Through the night into the break of day
Because its been so dark so long
I can’t tell whats going on
Two hearts beat together
A single flame
But we’re not still together
Like the rain
Been so long
Daylight save me all my head like I’ve had enough
Of all the blame I put on you lately
