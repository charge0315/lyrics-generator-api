Love, has finally come my way
You fill my everyday with love, I think I'll stay around
Your sweet love, has brought new life to me
A pair of eyes to see, so I don't have to dream about

Loving you, is changing everything
I've got this song to sing
For you, for love

Oh girl, thank your smile, thank you for the time, we're spending
For the love, for the love that you give
Oh girl, thank you for my life
I thank you everytime, I think of you and I
Now I live for love

When loneliness is gone, and happiness is found
With love I think I'll stay around
Your sweet love, has taught me something new
Has brought me home to you
So I don't have to dream about

Loving you, is changing everything
I've got this song to sing
For you, for love

Oh girl, thank your smile, for the time we're spending
For the love, for the love that you give
Oh girl, thank you for my life
I thank you everytime, I think of, you and I
Live for, live for, live for love
Loving you is changing everything
I've got this song to sing
For you, for love
Oh girl, thank you for the life
I thank you everytime I think of you and I
And now live for love
Oh girl, thank your smile, thank you for the time, we're spending
For the love, for the love that you give
Oh girl, thank you for my life
I thank you everytime I think of you and I
Now I live for love
