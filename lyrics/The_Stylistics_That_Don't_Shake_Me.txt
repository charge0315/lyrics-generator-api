I ain't got
A penny in my pocket, believe it
I ain't got no fancy, credit card
I ain't got
A friend to chase Manhattan
Babe it's true

But that don't shake me
'Cause baby I got you
I got you
That don't shake me
That don't, that don't
That don't shake me

Prices going up
And up and up
No one's got the bread
But when it comes to you and me (You and me)
The price of love is still for free (Still for free)
And I don't kick in the hand
And I don't kick in the hand

I ain't had a job in eighteen months now
What's worse
Lose my  apartment
Better pay it
Whoa oh oh oh yeah
I'm behind, three payments, and my classes
I'm confused (Huh)

But that don't shake mе
'Cause baby I got you
I got you
That don't shake me
That don't shakе me
That don't, that don't
That don't shake me
That don't, that don't (That don't shake me)
That don't shake me
That don't, that don't (No fancy credit card)
That don't shake me
That don't, that don't (That don't shake me)
That don't shake me
That don't, that don't (No friend to chase Manhattan)
That don't shake me...
