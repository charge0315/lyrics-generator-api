Come on along and listen to
The Lullaby of Broadway
The hip hooray and ballyhoo
The Lullaby of Broadway
The rumble of a subway train
The rattle of the taxis
The daffodils who entertain
At Angelo's and Maxi's

When a Broadway baby said good night
It's early in the morning
Manhattan babies didn't sleep tight
Until the dawn

Good night, baby
Good night, the milkman's on his way
Sleep tight, baby
Sleep tight, let's call it a day
Hey

Come on along and listen to
The Lullaby of Broadway
Da-di-dop, di-dop, di-dop, di-dop

The band began to go to town
And everything groove hazy
You rock-a-bye your baby 'round
To Ellington and Basy

When a Broadway baby said good night
It's early in the morning
Manhattan babies don't sleep tight
Until the dawn

Good night, babies
Good night, the milkman's on his way
Sleep tight, baby
Sleep tight, let's call it a day
But listen to the lullaby
Of old Broadway
Good night, babies
Good night, the milkman's on his way
Sleep tight, baby
Sleep tight, let's call it a day
But listen to the lullaby
Of old Broadway
Ah, da-do-do-bop
Ba-ba-ba-ba-bo-bay-bo-bo-ba-bo-da-do-ba (Ta)
Ba-da-da-bo-ba-da-ba
