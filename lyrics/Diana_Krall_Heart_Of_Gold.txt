I wanna live, I wanna give
I've been a miner for a heart of gold
It's these expressions I never give

That keep me searchin' for a heart of gold
And I'm gettin' old
Keeps me searchin' for a heart of gold
And I'm gettin' old

I've been to Hollywood, I've been to Redwood
I crossed the ocean for a heart of gold
I've been in my mind, it's such a fine line

That keeps me searchin' for a heart of gold
And I'm gettin' old
Keeps me searchin' for a heart of gold
And I'm gettin' old

Keep me searchin' for a heart of gold
You keep me sеarchin' and I'm growin' old
Keep me searchin' for a heart of gold
I'vе been a miner for a heart of gold
