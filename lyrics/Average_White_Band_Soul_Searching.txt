Sometimes I'm lazy or maybe just holding back
Anyway, it's hard to know the difference
Sometimes I get crazy
But if I do, it doesn't matter, no, no
What I'm doing is

Soul searching
Digging a little bit deeper every day
(Digging a little bit deeper every day)
Soul searching
Looking inside trying to find the way (Looking inside)
And it all adds up to what I'm trying to say, ooh, yeah

There's nothing game about trying, hope you get inspired
Got to find your imagination, ooh
All it needs is one spark
To kindle the fire within your body
So you see me really

Soul searching
Digging a little bit deeper every day
(Digging a little bit deeper every day)
Soul searching
Looking inside trying to find the way (Looking inside)
And it all adds up to what we have to say
No, no, ain't no harm in trying anyway (Anyway)

Sometimes we make music
Sometimes we make love
Still, we keep on trying

Soul searching
Digging a little bit deeper every day, baby
(Digging a little bit deeper every day)
Soul searching
Looking inside trying to find the way, baby (Looking inside)
Soul searching
Digging a little bit deeper every day
(Digging a little bit deeper every day)
And it all adds up to what we're trying to say
It's no use, no use, crying to yourself, girl
No and it ain't no harm in trying anyway
What we do is soul searching (Yeah)
Searching, searching, searching, searching
