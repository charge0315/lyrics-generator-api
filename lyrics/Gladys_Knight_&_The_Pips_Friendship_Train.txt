Chugga, chugga, woo, woo, woo, woo
Chugga, chugga, woo, woo, woo, woo

Calling out to everyone across the nation (Nation, nation, nation)
Said the world today is in a desperate situation (Desperate situation)
Stealing, burning, fighting, killing, nothing but corruption
It looks like mankind in on the eve of destruction
Oh, yes, it is now, people, let me tell you that
We got to learn to live with each other
No, no matter what race, creed, or color
I just got to tell you what the world needs now (What the world needs now)
Is love and understanding

Get on board the friendship train
Everybody shake a hand, shake a hand
People are talking 'bout the friendship train
Everybody shake a hand, make a friend now

Listen to us now (Chugga, chugga, woo, woo, woo, woo)
We're doing our thing (On the friendship train)
We've got to start today to make tomorrow a brighter day for our children, oh

So get on board the friendship train
Everybody, shake a hand, shake a hand

Get on board and shake a hand, make a friend now, now, now

It don't matter what you look, look, look like, people, or who you are
If your heart is in the right place, talking 'bout the right place, you're welcome aboard now
