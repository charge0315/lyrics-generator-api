Doing shows around the globe, i hope my momma proud
Told my boy "I'm on the road, nigga hold it down"
Bat signal in the sky, bring them choppas out
We've been cooking shit up quick like the waffle house
You ain't talking bout' no money, what you talking bout?
I've been focused on some cheddar, I'm the cheddar man
I don't see these niggas Hellen Keller, damn
We gon' see who did it when the dust settle in

Go and kill the cam
Kill the cam, go and kill the cam
Kill the cam, go and kill the cam
Fuck a trend, I ain't blending in

Fuck what nigga doing, fuck your status quo
I was in them unknown catacombs
I just hit my bitch, told her "bring that money home"
Cuz' you know I'm bout my cheddar and my provolone
Girl, i got everything you need like Costco
Bottegas on my feet, call it
I ain't fucking with these niggas, no muchachos
Niggas biting on my swag, boy that's not yours
Yeah you know that he my son, but his pops gone
I see why the hatred in him, so I'm stuntin' on em'
I've been going "Kill the cam" run in and I'm stuntin' on em'
I can't pick up the phone cuz' I'm on tour right now
I've been booked for low i think i got a show right now
Get them hundreds in i think i want some more right now
My life moving so fast i can't slow it down
No brakes, all gas when i roll around
Kill the cam
Kill the cam, kill the cam, kill the cam
Kill the cam, kill the cam, kill the cam
Menacing, on the road, dividends

Go and kill the cam
Kill the cam, go and kill the cam
Kill the cam, go and kill the cam
Fuck a trend, i ain't blending in
