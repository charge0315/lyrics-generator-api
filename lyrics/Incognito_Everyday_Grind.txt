Ooh..baby ( baby)
The bottom line's been reached
Our love, our long time bridge
The bath that brought us here
They  into the atmosphere
Into the atmosphere
The raise of  fire of yesterday’s desire
How  are broken too slowly fades
Into the palest blue
Into the palest blue

I have to get away
And let my mind unwind
Shakehand the everyday grind
I have to find the will to leave it all behind
Before I lose my  mind
Ooh..baby
Ooh..baby  ( baby)

Honey you go yours
And baby I go mine
Let major realign
No compromise
I  bet we live my life
I  bet we live my life

I have to get away
And let my mind unwind
Shakehand the everyday grind
I have to find the will to leave it all behind
Before I lose my  mind

For longer that I can remember
We’ve been alone even when we were together

I have to get away
And let my mind unwind
Shakehand the everyday grind
I have to find the will to leave it all behind
Before I lose my  mind

I have to get away
And let my mind unwind
Shakehand the everyday grind
I have to find the will to leave it all behind
Before I lose my  mind
I have to get away
Let my mind unwind
Shakehand the everyday grind
Oh I have to find the will to leave it all behind
Before I lose my  mind
