Make love
Do it today, don't wait until tomorrow
Make love
The only way to wipe away your sorrow, love
Life is more
Than the money you're working for
Than the shine of a brand new car
Than champagne or caviar
Mmmm
Life can be (aaah)
Like a beautiful symphony (aaah)
It can be just like paradise
If you take my advice
Make love whenever you can
Believe me, baby
Not every now and again
I tell you, baby
Make love whenever you can
You'll be a newborn man
Oh, make love whenever you can
Believe me, baby
Not every now and again
I tell you, baby
Make love whenever you can
You'll be a newborn man
Make love
It gives your life a very new dimension
Make love
As long as you make love you won't be pensioned off
Life's a bore
If your heart's not an open door
When you're hiding behind the wall
You'll be missing it all
Mmmm
Now come on (aaah)
Life is short so don't wait to long (aaah)
You'll enjoy every night and day
If you do as I say
Make love whenever you can
Believe me, baby
Not every now and again
I tell you, baby
Make love whenever you can
You'll be a newborn man
Oh, make love whenever you can
Believe me, baby
Not every now and again
I tell you, baby
Make love whenever you can
You'll be a newborn man
Love, love!
Make love whenever you can
Believe me, baby
Not every now and again
I tell you, baby
Make love whenever you can
You'll be a newborn man
Oh, make love whenever you can
Believe me, baby
Not every now and again
I tell you, baby
Make love whenever you can
You'll be a newborn man
Make love whenever you can
Believe me, baby
Not every now and again
I tell you, baby
Make love whenever you can
You'll be a newborn man
