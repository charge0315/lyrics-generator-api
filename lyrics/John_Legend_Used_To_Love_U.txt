Maybe it's me
Maybe I bore you
No-no, it's my fault
'Cause I can't afford you
Maybe Baby
Puffy or JAY-Z
Would all be better for you
'Cause all I could do was love you

Baby, when I used to love you
There's nothin' that I wouldn't do
I went through the fire for you
Anything you asked me to
But I'm tired of livin' this lie
It's gettin' harder to justify
I realize that I just don't love you
Not like I used to

Holla, holla, holla (Yeaaah)
Holla, holla, holla (Yeah, yeah, uh, uh)

Maybe I should
Rob somebody
So we could live like
Whitney and Bobby
It's probably my fault
My bad, my loss
But you are above 'cause
All I could do was love you

Baby, when I used to love you
There's nothin' that I wouldn't do
I went through the fire for you
Anything you asked me to
But I'm tired of livin' this lie
It's gettin' harder to justify
I realize that I just don't love you
Not like I used to

Holla, holla, holla (Yeaaah)
