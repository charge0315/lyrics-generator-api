“I long for you, my lord.”
An immaculate snake, lived a millennium's span
Such lengthy life, turns one into an apparition
A spectacle indeed, a female shape-shifting serpent
That serpent takes a human form
A woman of incomparable beauty
She's got the lord entwined in her coil
“I am but a nameless white snake
But still, I offer my vows.”
“Come now
Come now
Please, this way.”
“Hurry!”
An encounter imbued with spiritual resonance
An enthralling affair free of sorrow
Do come
Come, caress mе
If we are to consume еach other, then so be it
In the interplay of human and snake, a venom comes forth
A venom comes forth
Tonight
A fleeting affair, a night of mutual madness
A lustful night of mutual madness
Do come
Come, caress me
Even if this night brings an end
An ecstasy of the highest order
A thorough lovemaking
Do come
Come, caress me
If you're to be devoured, so be it
In the interplay of human and snake, a venom comes forth
A venom comes forth
