I won't dance
Don't ask me
I won't dance
Don't ask me
I won't dance
Madame with you

My heart won't let my feet
Do things they should do
You know what? You're lovely
And so what? I'm lovely
But, oh, what'd you do to me?
I'm like an ocean wave that's bumped on the shore
I feel so absolutely stumped on the floor

When you dance
You're charming and you're gentle
Especially when we do the continental
But this feeling isn't purely mental
For heaven rest us
We're not asbestos
And that's why

I won't dance, why should I?
I won't dance, how could I?
I won't dance
Merci Beaucoup

You know that music leads the way to romance
So if I hold you in my arms
I won't dance

When you dance you're charming and you're gentle
Especially when we do the continental
But this feeling isn't purely mental (Oh really?)
For heaven rest us
I'm not asbestos
And that's why

I won't dance
Why should I?
I won't dance
How could I?
I won't dance
Merci beaucoup

We'll know that music leads the way to romance
So if I hold you in my arms

I won't dance
I won't dance
I won't dance
I won't dance
I won't dance, dance, dance!
I won't dance!
Dance
