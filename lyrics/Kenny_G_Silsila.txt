Me and you shared love babe
All these haters hated from the start babe
We went down we got back up
Watching the stars shining bright
Everybody asks me where you at babe
Its like i dont exist without your love babe
All this to me means that
What we shared was
(Kennly - hook)
Real love, real love, real love
Real lo-lo-lo-love
All this gotta mean that we shared
Real love, real love, real love
Real lo-lo-lo-love
Babe i know what we shared was
Real love, real love, real love
Real love
Babe i know that we shared
Real love, real love, real love
Real lo-oh-oh-ve
(Thando)
I dont know if you know it
And i dont know if you notice
That my love for you has never changed
I've been through so much
For so long now you're gone
And i'm still here waiting for you my love
I dont know if you know it
And i dont know if you notice
That you sttill my pride and you still my joy
Love cannot difine us,love cannot difine us
Of what we shared
Cause what we shared was
(E-Dlozi)
We kiss , we love
We trust , we love
We love
We kiss, we love
We trust , we care
We love
We kiss , we love
We trust , we care
We love , we love
Be still and low
Be chilled just know i'm yours
I'm yours
(Kennly)
Fuck haters yea
I know you wanna show me love
You scared of what people will say
Well you are not the only
(Thando)
You know i'm the only one
I can tell that love is blind
I'm tired of being treated that way
Now i'm only taking my lane
(Kennly)
Sometimes i get the feeling
Real love is never temporary
(stating facts i dont know babe
I'm the one who was wrong babe)
Sometimes i get the feeling
Real love is never temporary
(stating facts i dont know babe
I'm the one who was wrong babe)
