Words in my mouth
Someone told me to say
They go unspoken
My mind gets in the way
I hold my tongue
Save my, save my soul
True to myself
And stay gold

Sometimes, you gotta pull the plug
Somewhere, a little place to crawl
Love me for who I am
It doesn't have to be this hard for an ordinary man

I wanna take cover, take cover
From you, wake me when its over
Take cover, I wanna take cover
From you
Sold all my dreams
Watched them all disappear
Ive spilled my blood
No one seems to care

Sometimes, you gotta pull the plug
Somewhere, a little place to crawl
Love me for who I am
How low do I have to go to make you understand

I wanna take cover, take cover
From you, wake me when its over
Take cover, I wanna take cover
From you

I wanna take cover, take cover
From you, wake me when its over
Take cover, I wanna take cover
From you

Cover, take cover
Nothing I can do to keep from going under
Take cover, take cover
From you
Save my soul
Save my soul
