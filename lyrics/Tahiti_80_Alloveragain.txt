Can't get much done these days
Gotta find a different way
I'd like to start all over again
Things keep on happening
I only stand and watch them
I need to get back on the train
How was I supposed to know that you'd
Be here today but gone tomorrow?
I always try to anticipate
But it moves so fast that I can't calculate
Can't get much done these days
Gotta find a different way
I'd like to start all over again
Things keep on happening
I never see them coming
I need to get back on the train
Where am I supposed to go?
I've looked everywhere, I've just been
Watching the show
I know I need to concentrate
The way I feel, I don't articulate
Can't get much done these days
Can't get much done these days
Things keep on happening
I never see them coming
I need to get back on the train
It's plain to see
You're almost there
But something is missing
Nighttime, daytime
Can't you see you're trying too hard?
You hear voices
It's time to come back
Where you belong
Can't get much done these days
Can't get much done these days
I've got to get back on the train
I'd like to start all over again
(Hey, you, I thought that you would want me
I thought that you would need somebody)
