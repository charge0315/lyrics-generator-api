It’s a steel cage trap
(Steel cage, steel cage, steel cage trap)
Niggas still say, “Facts,” but it still ain’t that
(Still say, “Facts,” but it still ain’t that)
‘Cause the shit’s not real if the bills ain’t taxed
(Shit’s not real if the bills ain’t taxed)
You could feel that pain in a steel cage trap
(Steel cage, steel cage) In a steel cage
In a steel cage trap—uh!
I ain’t never spend a day inside
I ain’t never spend a day inside, but I ain’t never been free
Lord knows I had to pay my fines, pay my dues
And pay my tithes in a steel cage trap
I ain’t never spend a day inside
I ain’t never spend a day inside, but I ain’t never been free
Lord knows I had to pay my fines, pay my duеs
And pay my tithes in a steel cage trap

Ayyo, I see
Killers in my rеar-view, dealers in my back seat
Hand-to-hand tag-team down a backstreet
Seven grams on my side, blunt lit, one sip
IRS on my ass, living tax-free
Dues paid if you ask me.  Tell them niggas
.  I’m on
An exodus, I’m talking, “Move way!”  I’m busy
Losing my religion on a crusade, offshore
Talking new-wave Max B, hit the 2K
Offline, can’t track me.  You ain’t no match
Can’t steel cage trap me.  Please stay
Facts actually.  You made it ‘bout race
At the track meet, you the bump in the road
You the acne.  I’m Proactiv
With a gang of blackheads, me and my pro-black mates
The block lit.  You trying to crack heads?
We gon’ pop shit.  You better break out
When I lock in.  I am not him
Can’t box him, and I will not fit

In a steel cage trap
(In a steel cage trap)
‘Cause the shit’s not real if the bills ain’t taxed
(In a steel cage) In a steel cage

I ain’t never spend a day inside
I ain’t never spend a day inside, but I ain’t never been free
Lord knows I had to pay my fines, pay my dues
And pay my tithes in a steel cage trap
I ain’t never spend a day inside
I ain’t never spend a day inside, but I ain’t never been free
Lord knows I had to pay my fines, pay my dues
And pay my tithes in a steel cage trap

Guerilla for sale, guerilla for sale, post-
-office traumatic stress, I deliver the mail for seven
Hours and fifty-nine minutes of hell, I left
A minute early, my body was feeling Bobby Hurley
The two-percent milk was kind of curly in my coffee this morning
Bagels with cream cheese and jelly, steady on an
Iron horse, bumping Makaveli, it’s a “White Man’z World”
Because they bomb first with the long arm of the law
It’s a Javon Kearse.  The beat is my canvas
This is a Converse from a convert true and living
Realest nigga on Earth.  Against all odds
Me and my girlfriend screaming, “Hail Mary”
My train of thought, the third rail scary—word to Ramon
I spit, I’m living in the present, my presence
Is God’s gift, a rapper unwrapping
A conflict, being an artist

I ain’t never spend a day inside
I ain’t never spend a day inside, but I ain’t never been free
Lord knows I had to pay my fines, pay my dues

Walked the halls of the high school where I grew up (Harlem!)
Shit’ll probably remind you of a scene out of
Lean On Me.  I just wanna see Steel get free
Be a Freeman, no Morgan Stanley.  Can’t be
In debt and stand in and rep, Stand and
Deliver ‘til they hand me a check.  I’m Edward James
Olmos/Almost there to the Family set
Tryna see a squad of angels on my side
While the crew move silent and jack cars for new tires
Lou Diamond Phillip screwdrivers
Blind-Sided cops hopping out, shots popping
Outside by the high schools where I grew up
Look like a prison from outside.  You tough?
They told us we had Dangerous Minds, Catwoman taught us
All that we know, apparently Sandra Bullock’s my hero
Sandra Bland just a mural—huh!
