I think this is a song we could redo in the language of every country we go to

Fa fa fafa, fa fa fafa
Raise your voice!

Don't be played like someone else's board game
Don't be passed out like some desolate readout
Don't be misled you've got alot on your head
And nobody's gonna pay attention when you are dead

Fa fa fafa, fa fa fafa
Raise your voice!

It's the primary rule, you gotta wanna be fooled
It's our daunted restraint that keeps us silent in shame
It's our nature to be adversarial and free
Our evolution didn't hinge on passivity

Fa fa fafa, fa fa fafa
Raise your voice!
