Turning faded pages
A hint of color
She was refugee
From across the wall

Acting out a story
Written in air
Illicit in the darkness
Silent applause

Dancing with sadness
Just for herself
Lost in the motion
A mime with no end

Shadows hold jealous eyes
Icy in May
Points on a silhouette
Slow fading shoes

Dancing with sadness
Just for herself
Lost in the motion
A mime with no end

Je suis fatiguée du même vieux chaos
J'en suis malade
Il devrait y avoir une sortie à ce cul-de-sac

Acting out a story
Written in air
Illicit in the darkness
Silent applause

Dancing with sadness
Just for herself
Lost in the motion
A mime with no end

Dancing with sadness
Just for herself
Lost in the motion
A mime with no end

Dancing with sadness
Just for herself
Lost in the motion
A mime with no end

Dancing with sadness
Just for herself
Lost in the motion
A mime with no end

Dancing with sadness
Just for herself
Lost in the motion
A mime with no end

Dancing with sadness
Just for herself
