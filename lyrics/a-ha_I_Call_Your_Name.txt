We got married on a cold mid-winter's morning
We said our lines then kissed and it was over
Those pronouncements had such weight
I guess they made us hesitate, hesitate

When she moved her hips and swayed in my direction
I thought we could make it yet
And beat the isolation
But in that gentle dark
Man, we tore ourselves apart

Through the fire and rain
Through the wilderness and pain
Through the losses, through the gains
On love's rollercoaster train
I call your name
I call your name

Through the fire and rain
Through the wilderness and pain
Through the losses, through the gains
On love's roller coaster train
I call your name

We used to laugh
Is the fire dying, babe? It hurts to ask
Let me hold you for a while

Through the fire and rain
On love's roller coaster train
I call your name
I call your name

Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo-ooh, woo-hoo, hoo-hoo
Hoo-hoo woo-hoo
Ow
Woo-hoo, hoo-ooh, hoo-hoo, hoo-ooh, hoo-ooh, hoo-hoo
Woo-hoo, hoo-hoo
We got married on a cold mid-winter's morning
