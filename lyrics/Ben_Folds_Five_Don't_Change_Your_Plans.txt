Sometimes I get the feeling
That I won't be on this planet
For very long
I really like it here
I'm quite attached to it
I hope I'm wrong
All I really wanna say
You're the reason I wanna stay
I loved you 'fore I met you
And I met you just in time
'Cause there was nothing left
I sat here on my suitcase
In our empty new apartment
'Til the sun went down
Then I walked back down the stairs
With all my bags and drove away
You must be freaking out
All I know is I gotta be
Where my heart says I oughta be
It often makes no sense
In fact
I never understand these things I feel
Don't change your plans for me
I won't move to LA
The leaves are falling back east
That's where I'm gonna stay
You have made me smile again
In fact, I might be sore from it
It's been a while
I know we've been together many times before
I'll see you on the other side
But don't change your plans for me
I won't move to LA
The leaves are falling back east
That's where I'm gonna stay
All I really wanna say
Is you're the reason I wanna stay
But destiny is calling and won't hold
And when my time is up I'm outta here
All I know is I've gotta be
Where my heart says I oughta be
It often makes no sense, in fact
I never understand these things
I feel
I love you, goodbye
I love you, goodbye
