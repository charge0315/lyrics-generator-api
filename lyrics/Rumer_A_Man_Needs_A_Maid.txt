My life is changing in so many ways
I don't know who to trust anymore
There's a shadow running through my days
Like a beggar going from door to door
I was thinking that maybe I'd get a maid
Find a place nearby for her to stay
Just someone to keep my house clean
Fix my meals and go away

A maid
A man needs a maid
A maid

It's hard to make that change
When life and love turn strange
And old
To give a love
You gotta live a love
To live a love
You gotta be "part of"
When will I see you again?

A while ago somewhere, I don't know when
I was watching a movie with a friend
I fell in love with the actress
She was playing a part that I could understand

A maid
A man needs a maid
A maid

To give a love
You gotta live a love
To live a love
You gotta be "part of"
When will I see you again?
