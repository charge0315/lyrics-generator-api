Stop thinking of this as being money
"It's just money, I'ma make more"
No, no, no-no-no-no
Please decondition yourself
It's not just money, it's happiness
It's the difference between happy, being happy and sad
It's the difference between having a home and living on the streets
That's what it is, it's not just money
It's so much more than that
Right now, it's the difference between you being able to go to a prom and disappointing a girl
As I told you from the beginning, I don't have money
I have bills to pay, but that meant nothing to you, absolutely nothing
Hmm, let's see, I have
Ooh, yeah, I'ma make myself a hot link when I get home
Meant nothing to you
Saving my seven dollars
