I can never, never, never, never
Live without you
Never wanna live without you
'Cause my life be incomplete without you, so
I looked into the glass ran ahead of time
Paid a million to the past now I hope to find
I'll never have to live without you
And you'll love me like the day when we first saw the sun
Shining bright behind the moon
When I'm in your presence
It fulfills my strong desire
As long I've been searching
Now. I finally feel the fire
You gave me the love that
I've been needing for so long
You built me up when I was weak
And now I am strong
Nothing in this world
Creates a loving space
So nothing in this world can take your place
Never wanna live without you
'Cause my life be incomplete without you, so
I looked into the glass ran ahead of time
Paid a million to the past now I hope to find
I'll never have to live without you
And you'll love me like the day when we first saw the sun
Shining bright behind the moon
There's no space or time
Where our love exists
Eternal love that we have found
Is planted on a wish
Every morning when I wake
I see your lovely face
And all things that cloud my mind
Are suddenly erased
Nothing in this world
Creates a loving space
So nothing in this world can take your place
Never wanna live without you
'Cause my life be incomplete without you, so
I looked into the glass ran ahead of time
Paid a million to the past now I hope to find
I'll never have to live without you
And you'll love me like the day when we first saw the sun
Shining bright behind the moon
Oh, what a wonderful journey we've traveled
Far, just to get to this place
And now, that we're here it's forever and ever
Love, just you and I
