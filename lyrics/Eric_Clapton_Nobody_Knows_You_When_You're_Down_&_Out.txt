Once I lived the life of a millionaire
Spent all my money, didn't have any care
Took all my friends out for a mighty good time
Bought bootleg liquor, champagne and wine
Then I began to fall so low
Lost all my good friends, and nowhere to go
I get my hands on a dollar again
I'm gonna hang on to it 'til that old eagle grins

Because nobody knows you
When you're down and out
In your pocket, not one penny
And as for friends, you don't have many

When you get back on your feet again
Everybody wants to be your long, lost friend
I said it's strange, without any doubt
Nobody knows you when you're down and out

No, nobody knows you
When you're down and out
In your pocket, not one penny
And as for friends, you don't have many

When you get back on your feet again
Everybody wants to be your long, lost friend
I said it's strange, without any doubt
Nobody knows you (Nobody knows you)
Nobody knows you (Nobody knows you)
Nobody knows you when you're down and out
