Raining and the weather's foul
Think I better rest a while
Mother, mother's son
Think I'll make a great big kiss
Pray they don't need much to cease
Mother, mother's son
Get down and get funky
Watch out for damn junkies
Mother, mother's son
Mother

Mother's son
Mother

In the street with the people you meet
Getting tired, want something to eat
Mother, mother's son
No, you won't be a superstar
But try to be the child you are
Mother, mother's son
Can't let 'em fool ya
Or we'll have to school ya
Mother, mother's son

Mother, mother's son

Can't get no wilder
When they get you in front of a gun
Just thinking not giving
Makes life not worth living
Can't let 'em fool ya
Or we'll have to school ya
Know you want to be a superstar
But try to be the child you are
