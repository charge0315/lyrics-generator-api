You can do what you want
When you think no one's lookin'
But you got to learn to love
You can play what you want
But you won't get a bookin'
'Til you learn to love
Though all logic seems to
Point the other way
(You gotta think like a lover)
You know if you want it to stay
Though your reckless heart
Will surely make you pay
(You gotta think like a lover)
You know if you've a will
You're bound to make a way
You can howl at the moon
When the city lies sleepin'
But you got to learn to love
(Got to learn to love)
You can take what you want
But there's nothing worth keepin'
(Nothin' worth keepin')
'Til you learn to love
('Til you learn to love)
Though all logic seems to
Point the other way
(You gotta think like a lover)
You know if you want it to stay
Though your reckless hеart
Will surely make you pay
(You gotta think like a lovеr)
You know if you've a will
You're bound to make a way
You got to learn to love
(You got to learn to love)
Make a way
Got to learn to love
(Got to learn to love)
(You gotta think like a lover)
(You gotta think like a lover)
Bound to make a way
You got to learn to love
(You got to learn to love)
Make a way
You got to learn to love
(You got to learn to love)
Make a way
You got to learn to love
(You got to learn to love)
Make a way
