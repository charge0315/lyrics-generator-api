I said I'd never fall in love with you
You were a dream I'd never let come true
I seen your tears each time I passed you by
Until I seen you with another guy
Now I'm lost in love with you
I don't know what to do
I let you slip away
You know you're lost in love
When you take for granted heaven
Could our romance be through
When I'm lost in love with you?
(You know I'm lost in love)
I see his car when I pass by your place
I want the lips that only he will taste
I guess my love was burnin' deep inside
If you're supposed to trust your heart
Then tеll me why mine lied
Now I'm lost in lovе with you
I don't know what to do
I let you slip away
You know you're lost in love
When you take for granted heaven
Could our romance be through
When I'm lost in love with you?
Were you a distant lover?
(I'm just your distant lover)
It could've been all in my mind
No, it's not my imagination
(I'm just your distant lover)
Girl, I want you all the time
Oh, yeah
Hey, yeah
I, I'm so lost without
'Cause now I'm lost in love with you
I don't know what to do
I let you slip away
You know you're lost in love
When you take for granted heaven
Could our romance be through
When I'm lost in love with you?
You know you're lost in love
When you take for granted heaven
Could our romance be through
When I'm lost in love with you?
You know you're lost in love
When you take for granted heaven
Could our romance be through
When I'm lost in love with you?
