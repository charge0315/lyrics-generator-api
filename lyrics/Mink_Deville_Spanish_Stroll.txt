Hey, Mr. Jim, I can see the shape you're in
Finger on your eyebrow
And left hand on your hip
Thinking that you're such a lady killer
Think you're so slick!
Alright

Brother Johnny, he caught a plane and he got on it
Now he's a razor in the wind
And he got a pistol in his pocket
They say the man is crazy on the coast
Lord, there ain't no doubt about it
Well, alright

Sister Sue, tell me, baby, what are we gonna do
She said take two candles
And then you burn them out
Make a paper boat, light it and send it out
Send it out now

Hey, Rosita! Donde vas con mi carro Rosita?
Tu sabes que te quiero
Pero ti me quitas todo
Ya te robasta mi television y mi radio
Y ahora quiere llevarse mi carro
No me haga asi, rosita
Ven aqui
Ehi, estese aqui al lado rosita

Spanish Stroll

Hey Johny!
We've been looking for you, man
