Rain, rain, rain on my mind
I've got a secret life
Wipe, wipe, wipe it away
Nothing can make me dry
Fight all the while
Fight 'til I think I'm free
Feel rains we'll never see
Beautiful secret lives

It can make you
Face all your fears
It can make you
Face all your fears

Oh, smile, smile in the day
Fear takes its place at night
Oh, oh, you're pretty in the rain
I love your secret life

It can make you
Face all your fears
It can make you
Face all your fears

I could leave you well enough alone
Believe and you'll be overcome
And gone by grace away
Better off than if I stay
I could leave you well enough alone
Believe and you'll be overcome
And gone by grace away
Better off than if I stay
I could leave you, walk away
We'll save it for another day
Through all the wars, I've come to know
It's punches pulled, not towels thrown in

When they come knocking on your heart's door
Choose the one who loves you more, oh
And when you find something to die for
(Make you face all your fears)
They'll be knocking on your heart's door
(Make you face all your fears)
When they come knocking on your heart's door
(Make you face all your fears)
Choose the one who loves you more, oh
(Make you face all your fears)
And when you find something to die for
(Make you face all your fears)
They'll be knocking on your heart's door
(Make you face all your fears)
When they come knocking on your heart's door
(Make you face all your fears)
Choose the one who loves you more
(Make you...)
