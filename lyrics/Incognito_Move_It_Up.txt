Your lies been gone so long
I’ve been getting strong
You say that’s same old song
Talking bout how you did
And do long
All the things that you’re putting through
When a heart belong to you
The dark places that you took me to
When you’re into somebody new
Now your world is often slow
Didn’t you going in my eyes

Move it up
Now that I’m ahead of the game
(Move it up)
I’m never going back again
(Move it up)
Now that I’m ahead of the game
(Move it up)
Ooh

Can’ t keep coming back for more
I heard it all before
Keep on knocking at the same old door
If they looking for some old score
I used to break when I heard you cry
This time knowing this won’t fly
You never married when you say goodbye
Well that’s just another line
Now your world is often slow
Didn’t you going in my eyes

Move it up
Now that I’m ahead of the game
(Move it up) hmm
I’m never going back again
(Move it up)
Now that I’m ahead of the game
(Move it up)
Ooh
Ahh…
Move it up
Now that I’m ahead of the game
(Move it up)
I’m never going back again
(Move it up) oh
Now that I’m ahead of the game
(Move it up)
Ooh
Move
Now that I’m ahead of the game
(Move it up)
I’m never going back
Never going back again
(Move it up)
Now that I’m ahead of the game
(Move it up)  moving up
(Move it up)
Now that I’m ahead of the game
(Move it up)
And never never r going back again
(Move it up)
Now that I’m ahead of the game
Move it up moving
Now that I’m ahead of the game
(Move it up)
And never never r going back again
(Move it up)
Ohh
Now that I’m ahead of the game
Move it up
