'Cause I remember
It was four hundred years or more
Since you came to crucify
And they were taken far away from home
There were promises of paradise
But if they had been told that day
That they would be sold this way
To satisfy the souls of chosen men
See I had to look carefully
At the shame of my ancestry
To redefine the story line again
Hey, if I was taken for a day and shown another way
Now every child can learn a different thing
See I tried a million times but I had to change my mind
Oh, sadness was the best thing I can bring
On the inside he was dead and this is what he said
As he took away the bloom above the clouds
Oh, superiority was clearly meant to be
So destiny will manifest in time
So where has love all gone?
A troubled trail of tears will tell the take
Of how I was put down where I don't belong
Woman, child and man for sale
For ethical slavery is just an absurdity
How can you be alive when you are dead?
With these chains of hypocrisy, the shame of my ancestry
Forever stained by blood in which you tread
Hey, if I was taken for a day and shown another way
Oh, now every child can learn a different thing
See I tried a million times but I had to change my mind
Oh, sadness was the best thing I can bring
On the inside he was dead, oh, and this is what he said
As he took away the bloom above the clouds
Oh, superiority was clearly meant to be
So destiny will manifest in time
So where has the love all gone
So wanna know where, wanna know where
Wanna know where, wanna know where
Somebody tell me where the love has all gone
