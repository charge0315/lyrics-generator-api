(Maria)
Hey-hey, eh, eh, hey, Maria (Maria)
Don't you hear me calling, Maria? (Maria)
Girl, you know you were the only one

Hey-hey, eh, eh, hey, Maria (Maria)
Don't you miss me a little? (Maria)
After all, you were the only one

Come on back to me, Maria (Maria)
Come on back to me, girl

Hey-hey, hey, eh, hey, Maria (Maria)
It's been long, so long, oh (Maria)
Since you've been gone

Hey-eh, eh, eh, ey, Maria (Maria)
Don't you need me just a little? (Maria)
'Cause honest, girl, you were the only one (Maria)
Come on back to me, Maria
Oh, come on back to me, girl (Maria)

Oh, Maria, ooh, baby (Maria)
I need you, hmm-hmm-mmm (Maria)
Maria (Maria)
Why, why you keep running away? (You keep running away)
Ooh, baby, you keep running away (You keep running away)
Ooh, baby, yeah

Maria, I need you, honey
Oh, Maria, you sweet little sunflower

Oh, hear my plea for sympathy
I just want you here with me, Maria
Ooh, yeah
Empty arms and lonely nights
That's my life without you, girl (Maria)
I'm so lonely, I'm so blue
Without you, darling, my life is through (Maria)
Come on back!

You keep running away
Come back, come back
(You keep running away)
Ooh, baby
I need you
(You keep running away)
I love you, ooh, baby
(You keep running away)
Ooh, baby
(Come back, come back)
Maria (You keep running away)
Ooh, baby, gotta have you
(You keep running away)
Oh, come back, come back
(Come back, come back)
Maria (You keep running away)
Ooh, baby, I need you
(You keep running away)
Gotta have you, gotta have you
(Come back, come back)
Maria (You keep running away)
Come back, come back, ooh, baby
(You keep running away)
Oh, come back, come back
(Come back, come back)
Maria (You keep running away)
I gotta have you, I gotta have you
(You keep running away)
Ooh, baby
