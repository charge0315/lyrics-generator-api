When I'm all alone with you
We do things that lovers do
Tell me, is this not true
When I look into your eyes
I'm convinced that you're mine
Or is this just in my mind?

You feel like my everything (Everything, everything)
When you're near, my aura beams (Aura beams, aura beams)
My eyes tell everything (Everything, everything)
Don't know the joy you bring

Just to be around you
So crazy 'bout you
Wanna get away with you
La di da di doo
Feel the ocean's breeze
Where will this all lead?
Deeper in my arms, hopefully

Could you be the one for me?
Am I blind and not see?
You're truly in love with me
And the things that you do
Always seem to lead to
You're truly in love with me

You treat me just like a queen (Like a queen, like a queen)
So good to me, you make my heart sing (Heart sing, heart sing)
My smile says everything (Says everything, says everything)
Love everything about you
Even the air around you (Ahh)

If I gave my all to you (You)
Would you change your attitude? ('Tude)
Could your love still be true? (True)
Would it always feel brand new? (New)
Only this I want from you (You)
If I gave my heart to you

Am I wrong for loving you? (Wrong for loving you)
Oh, the way that I do (Way that I do)
I'm truly in love with you
Could you be the one for me? (Be the one for me)
Am I blind and not see? (Blind and not see)
You're truly in love with me
And the quality time (Quality time)
Makes me feel you're all mine (Make me feel you're all mine)
I'm truly in love with you
And the things that you do
Always seem to lead to
You're truly in love with me

So crazy 'bout you (You)
Will it always feel brand new? (New)
Want to get away with you (You, you, you)
Would you change your attitude? ('tude)
Where would this all lead (Lead)
If I gave my heart to you? (You)
Deeper in my arms, hopefully

Am I wrong for loving you? (Wrong for loving you)
Oh, the way that I do (Way that I do)
I'm truly in love with you
Could you be the one for me? (Be the one for me)
Am I blind and not see? (Blind and not see)
You're truly in love with me
Oh, the quality time (Quality time)
Makes me feel you're all mine (Make me feel you're all mine)
I'm truly in love with you
When I'm all alone with you
We do things that lovers do
I'm truly in love with you
