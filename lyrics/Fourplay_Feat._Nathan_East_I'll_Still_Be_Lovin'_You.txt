Another night another day
It's making me crazy 'cause I can't relate
And I'm wishing right now
That I can just go back in time
I don't know where we're gonna end up
I know that we're gonna need a little bit of luck
And there's only one thing
Giving me some peace of mind
In the morning, I'll still be lovin' you
In the morning, I'll still be lovin' you
Father Time has a funny way
Of turning tomorrow into yesterday
You're damned if you don't
You're damned if you do
In the morning, I'll still be lovin' you
In the morning, I'll still be lovin' you
Seems like a long long way to go
But we've gotta hang tough
Wait a while give yourself a smile
And you'll realize that
At the end of the day
It's gonna work out
