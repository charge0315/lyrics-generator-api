Hey, little girl, would you like a dance?
Hey, little girl, want a quick romance?
Hey, little girl, won't you take a chance?
And celebrate summer with me

Hey, little chick, where did you learn that trick?
Hey, don't you know you got rock and roll?
Hey, little punk, forget all that junk
And celebrate summer with me

Summer's not a bummer
It's a stunner, and it's now
Summer's not a bummer
It's a stunner, and it's now
Summer is heaven in '77
