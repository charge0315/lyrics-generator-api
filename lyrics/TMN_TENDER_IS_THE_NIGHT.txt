Tender is the night
So tender is the night
There's no one in the world
Except the two of us

Should tomorrow
Find us disenchanted
We have shared a love
That few have known

Summers by the sea
A sailboat in Capri
These memories shall be
Our very own

Even though our dreams may vanish
With the morning light
We loved once in splendor
How tender, how tender the night

Even though our dreams may vanish
With the morning light
We loved once in splendor
How tender, how tender the night
