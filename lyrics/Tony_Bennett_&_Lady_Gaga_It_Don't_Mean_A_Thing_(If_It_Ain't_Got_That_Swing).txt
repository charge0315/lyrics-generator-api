It don't mean a thing
If it ain't got that swing
Doo-wah, doo-wah, doo-wah, doo-wah
Doo-wah, doo-wah, doo-wah, doo-wah
No it don't mean a thing
All you gotta do is swing
Doo-wah, doo-wah, doo-wah, doo-wah
Doo-wah, doo-wah, doo-wah, doo-wah

Makes no difference if it's sweet or it's hot
Give it all the rhythm that you've got

Oh, it don't mean a thing
If it ain't got that swing
Doo-wah, doo-wah, doo-wah, doo-wah
Doo-wah, doo-wah, Tony, Gaga

It makes no difference if it's sweet or hot
Just give that rhythm everything you've got

Oh, it don't mean a thing
If it ain't got that swing
Doo-wah, doo-wah, doo-wah, doo-wah
Doo-wah, doo-wah, doo-wah, doo-wah
Doo-wah, doo-wah, doo-wah, doo-wah
Doo-wah, doo-wah, doo-wah, doo-wah-dah
Doo-wah, doo-wah, doo-wah, doo-wah
Doo-wah, doo-wah, doo-wah, doo-wah
(Ba-da-da-bah-da-da-ba-da-ba-ba)
