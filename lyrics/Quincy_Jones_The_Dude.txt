Chorus:
Who is it
That walks the street with all the action?
(It's The Dude)
Who is it
That always gets a hot reaction?
(That's The Dude)
Verse 1:
Don'tcha' go makin' no mojo moves
'Round The Dude
(Don't try no funny bizness)
Don'tcha' be coppin' no attitude
With The Dude
(Hey, hey, here comes The Dude)
The Dude Speaks:
Hey everybody in the neighborhood
The beauty's on duty, better hear me good
Sister E-flat tomato, Brother B-flat balloon
Somethin' funky's goin' down, better listen to my tune
I graduated from the college of the streets
I got a P.H.D. in how to make ends meet
Inflation in the nation don't bother me
'Cause I'm a scholar with a dollar
You can plainly see
Bridge:
He's a winner 'cause it's in his blood
Ain't nobody who's out there like him
Any corner in the neighborhood
That's the place that you can always find him
Soft talkin' with a rap so sweet
(He does it good)
Ladies call him The Candy Rapper
(They want his love)
He's the only one that's really cool
(He's really cool)
That's the reason why he's The Dude
Chorus:
Who is it
That ain't got time for foolish talkin'?
(It's The Dude)
Who is it
That looks so clean you can't ignore him?
(That's The Dude)
Verse 2
Don'tcha' go mess with his walkin' stick
Not The Dude
(Don't try no funny bizness)
Don't you double-cross him, he's super slick
He's The Dude
(Hey, hey, here come The Dude)
The Dude Speaks Again:
I'm a stone cold taker
I'm a piggy bank shaker
An' I don't waste my time talkin' trash
So if you go to my school
You gotta learn this rule —
Don't let your mouth write a check
That your body can't cash
If you never had it
Don't pay it no mind
I know you're gonna get it
If you take a little time
Take a piece from the East
A piece from the West
Put it where it feels good
Let The Dude do the rest
Chant:
See him steppin' down the street
No forgettin', he's The Dude
See him steppin' down the street
No forgettin', he's The Dude
Repeat Verse 1
Bridge To Fade
