Buffalo soldier, dreadlock Rasta
There was a Buffalo Soldier in the heart of America
Stolen from Africa, brought to America
Fighting on arrival, fighting for survival
I mean it, when I analyze the stench
To me, it makes a lot of sense
How the dreadlock Rasta
Was a Buffalo Soldier

And he was taken from Africa, brought to America
Fighting on arrival, fighting for survival
Said it was a Buffalo Soldier, dreadlock Rasta
Buffalo Soldier in the heart of America

If you know your history
Then you would know where you're coming from
Then you wouldn't have to ask me
Who the heck do I think I am?

I'm just a Buffalo Soldier in the heart of America
Stolen from Africa, brought to America
Said he was fighting on arrival, fighting for survival
Said he was a Buffalo Soldier, in the war for America
Said he, woy, yoy, yoy, woy, yoy-yoy, yoy
Woy, yoy, yoy, yoy-yoy, yoy-yoy, yoy
Woy, yoy, yoy, woy, yoy-yoy, yoy
Woy, yoy, yoy, yoy-yoy, yoy-yoy, yoy

Buffalo Soldier troddin' through the land, whoa-ho!
Said he wanna ran and then you wanna hand
Troddin' through the land, yeah-heah-eah
Said he was a Buffalo Soldier in the war for America
Buffalo Soldier, dreadlock Rasta
Fighting on arrival, fighting for survival
Driven from the mainland to the heart of the Caribbean
Said he, woy, yoy, yoy, woy, yoy-yoy, yoy
Woy, yoy, yoy, yoy-yoy, yoy-yoy, yoy
Woy, yoy, yoy, woy, yoy-yoy, yoy
Woy, yoy, yoy, yoy-yoy, yoy-yoy, yoy

Trodding through San Juan
In the arms of America
Trodding through Jamaica, a Buffalo Soldier
Fighting on arrival, fighting for survival
Buffalo Soldier, dreadlock Rasta

Woy, yoy, yoy, woy, yoy-yoy, yoy
Woy, yoy, yoy, yoy-yoy, yoy-yoy, yoy
Woy, yoy, yoy, woy, yoy-yoy, yoy
