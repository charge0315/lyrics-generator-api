If I had a mind to
I wouldn't want to think like you
And if I had time to
I wouldn't want to talk to you, oh-oh-ho

I don't care what you do
I wouldn't want to be like you, yeah

If I was high class
I wouldn't need a buck to pass
And if I was a fall guy
I wouldn't need no alibi

I don't care what you do
I wouldn't want to be like you
No, oh, oh

Back on the bottom line
Diggin' for a lousy dime, yeah
If I hit a mother lode
I'd cover anything that showed, oh

I don't care what you do
I wouldn't want to be like you, oh-oh-oh
I don't care what you do
I wouldn't wanna, ah

I wouldn't want to be like you, oh-oh
I wouldn't want to be like you
Yeah, oh
Yeah, ooh
