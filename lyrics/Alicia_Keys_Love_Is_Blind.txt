Well, people don't see
What I see
Even when they're right there
Standing next to me

And all of my friends think I'm crazy
For loving you
What they don't know
There's nothing else I can do

And it's too bad 'cause love is blind
(It's too bad, it's too bad)
It's too bad 'cause love is blind
(It's too bad, so bad)
It's too bad 'cause love is blind
(It's too bad, it don't matter, baby)
It's too bad 'cause love is blind
(It's too bad, so sad)

See, people don't know
What I know
They say I'm losing my mind
I know I'm losing control
Hey

All of my friends think I'm crazy
But I don't care
I'm over the edge, no turning back
Belong to you, I swear, aye

And it's too bad 'cause love is blind
(It's too bad, it's too bad)
It's too bad 'cause love is blind
(It's too bad, so bad)
It's too bad 'cause love is blind
(It's too bad, it don't matter, baby)
It's too bad 'cause love is blind
(It's too bad, so sad)
It's too bad 'cause love is blind

Yeah (Oh, oh, ooh-oh)
Yeah (Oh, oh, ooh-oh)
Yeah (Oh, oh, ooh-oh)
Yeah (Oh, oh, ooh-oh)

And it's too bad 'cause love is blind
(It's too bad, it's too bad)
It's too bad 'cause love is blind
(It's too bad, so bad)
It's too bad 'cause love is blind
(It's too bad, it don't matter, baby)
It's too bad 'cause love is blind
(It's too bad, so sad)
It's too bad 'cause love is blind

Yeah (Oh, oh)
Yeah (Oh, oh)
