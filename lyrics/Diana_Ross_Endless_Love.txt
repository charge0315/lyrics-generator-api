My love
There's only you in my life
The only thing that's right
My first love
You're every breath that I take
You're every step I make

And I (I), I want to share
All my love with you
No one else will do
And your eyes (Your eyes, your eyes)
They tell me how much you care
Oh, yes, you will always be
My endless love

Two hearts
Two hearts that beat as one
Our lives have just begun
Forever (Oh, oh-oh-ooh)
I'll hold you close in my arms
I can't resist your charms

And love (Oh, love)
I'll be a fool for you, I'm sure
You know I don't mind (Oh, you know I don't mind)
'Cause you, you mean the world to me, oh
I know (I know)
(I've found) I've found in you my endless love

Oh-oh, oh-oh-ooh
Boom, boom
Boom-boom-boom-boom, boom-boom
Boom, boom, boom-boom, boom

Oh-oh-ooh, and love (Oh, love)
I'll be that fool for you, I'm sure
You know I don't mind (Oh, you know I don't mind)
And I don't mind

And,
yes
You'll be the only one
'Cause no one can deny
This love I have inside
And I'll give it all to you
My love (My love, my love)
My endless love
