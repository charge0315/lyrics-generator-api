Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, alright
See line woman
She drink coffee
She drink tea
And then go home
See line woman
See line woman
See line woman
Dressed in green
Wears silk stockings with golden seams
See line woman
See line woman
Dressed in red
Make a man lose his head
See line woman
See line woman
Black dress on
For a thousand dollars she wail and she moan
See line woman
Wiggle, wiggle
Turn like a cat
Wink at a man, and he wink back
Now child, see line woman
Empty his pockets
And wreck his days
Make him love her
And she'll fly away
See line woman
She drink coffee
She drink tea
And then go home
See line woman
See line woman
See line woman
Dressed in green
Wears silk stockings with golden seams
See line woman
See line woman
Dressed in red
Make a man lose his head
See line woman
See line woman
Black dress on
For a thousand dollars she wail and she moan
See line woman
Wiggle, wiggle
Turn like a cat
Wink at a man, and he wink back
Now child, see line woman
Empty his pockets
And wreck his days
Make him love her
And she'll fly away
See line woman
See line woman
See line woman
See line woman
See line woman
See line woman
See line woman
See line woman
See line woman
Take it on out now
Empty his pockets
And she wreck his days
And she make him love her
Then she sure fly away
She got a black dress on
For a thousand dollars she wail and she moan
