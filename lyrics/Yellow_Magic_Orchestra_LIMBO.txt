Right foot on the gas
The trees become a blur
Brake near the left foot
Smell the rubber burn
Out of the frying pan
Into the fire, that stands
Everywhere

Here we all sit and wait in limbo
Wondering which when will the wind blow
There's a new world beyond a window
Better or worse, I'm moving out of limbo

Walking back and forth
Walking in the mazes
Time ran and go back
Take it to the bridge
I've got no
Paticular place to go
Except limbo

Here we all sit and wait in limbo
Wondering which when will the wind blow
There's a new world beyond a window
Better or worse, I'm moving out of limbo

Right foot on the gas
Everything's a haze
Brake with the left foot
See the motor blades
Out of the frying pan
Into the fire, that stands
Everywhere

Here we all sit and wait in limbo
Wondering which when will the wind blow
There's a new world beyond a window
Better or worse, I'm moving out of limbo

Moving out of Limbo
Hit me!
Moving out of Limbo
Cold sweat
Moving out of Limbo
On the good foot!
Moving out of Limbo
