Insight to what's going on
Information keeps us strong
What you don't know can hurt you bad
Take it from me, you'll be walkin' around sad
Cryin' for a better day
Until you educate for a better way
So if you wanna be in control
You gotta get yourself in the know

Get the knowledge
That you really want
The knowledge
Do you really want?
It's the knowledge
What you really want
The knowledge
That you really want

Spreading vice, don't believe the hype
You don't find the knowledge in a pipe
Too many lives go up in smoke
It's nice to laugh but don't be the joke
To get over, get better
I try to be the possessor
Of the one thing we all need in life
To succeed take my advice

And get the knowledge (Knowledge)
That you really want
The knowledge (Knowledge)
Do you really want?
It's the knowledge (Knowledge)
What you really want (Ooh)
The knowledge (Knowledge)
That you really want

One, two, three, four
Prejudice?
No
Ignorance?
No
Bigotry?
No
Illiteracy?
No
Count
One, two, three, four
One, two, three, four
One, two, one, two
One, two, one, two
One, two, one, two
Knowledge, it's, it's, it's
Knowledge
One, two, one, four

Listen, it's up to everyone
If we're gonna change the way the world is run
The way to start is to rid the children of
Prejudice and ignorance (One, two)
We've gotta teach our kids to read and write
That's the only way to win the fight for life
Education is the goal so
If you wanna be in the know

Ooh (One, two)
Knowledge
One, two, one, two
Ooh
It's the one thing we all need in life, ooh
The knowledge
Knowledge
That you really want
You really need the knowledge
Do you really want?
Ooh, ooh, ooh, it's the knowledge
What you really want
Ooh, knowledge
That you really want
One, two, one, two
