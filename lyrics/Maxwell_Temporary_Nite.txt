Earthquake in the makin'
I'm gonna love you
When you persist with all that shakin'
What you expect me to do?
It's more than just the bacon, uh
It's somethin' about your insides too
Ooh, baby, you know I've been waiting
Waiting on the wall for you

So if ever you should question

If I spend the night with you
You and me, what you gonna do?
A temporary night for two
Don't change a lonely afternoon (Lonely afternoon)

I been misbehavin', uh, uh, uh
I been thinkin' nasty thoughts about you
I'm sorry, baby
I never said I was an angel
Who could be as fine, as fine as you?
Move that body, go ahead and cast that corporal spell
And if they ask me, baby, I promise not to tell

If I spend the night with you (If I spend the night, baby)
You and me, what you gonna do? (Oh, if I spend the night)
A temporary night for two (Oh, if I spend the night)
Don't change a lonely afternoon (Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah)

It's your style, your soul and those personalities (Personalities)
Temporary night
It's not the typical, no bull, baby (Put your hands up, put your hands up)
Want you as a wife
Want you all my life, yeah

If you ever wanna question

If I spend the night with you
You and me, what you gonna do? (Said I know it, said I know it, girl)
A temporary night for two (Oh, a temporary night)
Don't change a lonely afternoon (I said a temporary night)
If I spend the night with you (If I spend the night)
You and me, what you gonna do? (Oh, if I spend the night, baby)
A temporary night for two (Will you do me by?)
Don't change a lonely afternoon (Sugar baby, will you do my by?)
