Would you like to go back before it all turn black
Remember the other side
It's hard to go against the tide or walk if your step's behind
You can't make up your tired mind
Could you like to take care, bring new stars
Close your eyes throw one more dart
A king is a landslide and you feel trapped inside
Here comes another day, you are just too tired anyway
It goes on and on, still you don't know what to choose
Between good and bad you're not sure what you want to know
What do you want? Mother take back pains
All the color is black if something we shouldn't talk about
What do you want? Mother take back pains
All the color is black if something you shouldn't think about
A king is a landslide and you feel trapped inside
Here comes another day, you are just too tired anyway
It goes on and on, still you don't know what to choose
Between good and bad you're not sure what you want to know
And it feels like you lost yourself away
And it feels like you lost yourself away into the other side
And it feels like you lost yourself away into the other side
And it feels like you lost yourself away
Between good and bad you're not sure what you want to know
Between good and bad you're not sure what you want to choose
And it feels like you lost yourself away
And it feels like you lost yourself away into the other side
And it feels like you lost yourself away into the other side
