Hey yo, B
What up, A?
What we want?
Want them to say

Say you love me, say you love me
Then put it in a love song (Put it in a love song)
Say you need me, say you need me
Then write it in a letter form (Oh, oh-oh)
Say you want me, say you want me
Then text me on a cell phone (Text me on my cell phone)
Say you love me, say you love me
Then put me in a love song (Oh)

If you say you want me, yeah
You say you want me
If you do the right thing, we can be together
I'm not easy, yeah, you gotta work for it
I'm the real thing and babe, you gotta please me
All that talk, and boy, you better walk it
All that front and that's not how you do it
If you really need me like you say you need me
Baby, better show me, baby, better come and say

Say you love me, say you love me
Then put it in a love song (Put it in a love song)
Say you need me, say you need me

Say you want me, say you want me
Then text me on a cell phone (Text me on my cell phone)
Say you love me, say you love me
Then put me in a love song (Oh)

What you gonna do when somebody convinces
Me to believe that he can do it better?
Send me gifts and showin' me the romance
All this-this and that, can you do better?
All I'm saying love is what I'm looking for
If you wanna keep me, baby, gotta love me more
If you really want me, like you say you want me
If you really need me, baby, better come and say

Say you love me, say you love me
Then put it in a love song (Put it in a love song)
Say you need me, say you need me
Then write it in a letter form (Oh, oh-oh)
Say you want me, say you want me
Then text me on a cell phone (Text me on my cell phone)
Say you love me, say you love me
Then put me in a love song (Oh)

Gotta work it, baby, work it out
If you want me, baby, work it out
If you need me, baby, work it out
Gotta work it out, gotta work it out
If you love me, baby, work it out
Gotta work it, baby, work it out
If you want me, baby, work it out
Gotta work it out, gotta work it out (Say)

If you want my love and all of my time
Part of my plans and part of my mind
All of the things that you wanna do
But make sure your love for me's true to you
Oh, if you show me, baby, believe
So many possibilities
Oh, we can look to infinity
If you wanna be with me
Oh

Say you love me, say you love me
Then put it in a love song (Put it in a love song)
Say you need me, say you need me
Then write it in a letter form (Oh, oh-oh)
Say you want me, say you want me
Then text me on a cell phone (Text me on my cell phone)
Say you love me, say you love me
Then put me in a love song
One, two, three

Gotta work it, baby, work it out
If you want me, baby, work it out
If you need me, baby, work it out
Gotta work it out, gotta work it out
If you love me, baby, work it out
Gotta work it, baby, work it out
If you want me, baby, work it out
Gotta work it out, gotta work it out
