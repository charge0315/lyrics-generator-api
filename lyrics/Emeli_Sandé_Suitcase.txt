Didn't see it coming, no kind of warning
I can't work out what I've done wrong
His clothes are missing, but his key's still here
Please, somebody, tell me what's going on

My baby's got a suitcase
He's telling me it's too late
But don't, nobody, please don't ask me why
'Cause all I did was love him
But I can't stop him walking
My baby's got a suitcase, but, please don't ask me why

What changed so quickly? Answer me
If you must kill me, at least, please, tell me why
He says: "Don't touch me, get out the way"
Will someone tell me what's going on tonight?

My baby's got a suitcase
He's telling me it's too late
But don't, nobody, please don't ask me why
'Cause all I did was love him
But I can't stop him walking
My baby's got a suitcase, but please don't ask me why

I can't stop my heart
Leaving through the door
I can't unpack my heart
'Cause he won't look at me anymore

My baby's got a suitcase
He's telling me it's too late
But don't, nobody, please don't ask me why
'Cause all I did was love him
But I can't stop him walking
My baby's got a suitcase, but please don't ask me why
