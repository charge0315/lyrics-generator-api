Walk in the Light
That shines so bright
Let your soul feel the right
Of its pure gold, yeah
Won't you wake up, wake up, walk in the light
Won't you wake up, wake up, bring substance in your life
Won't you wake up, wake up, walk in the light
Won't you wake up, wake up, yeah
Where's your heart, where's your pride
Has it all been pushed aside
Lavish dreams, livin' high
Yet no substance in your life
It's a hard world, I know
But don't give in to the lies
You have always been a star
Everything you need's inside your heart
Oooh, your life is special, really special, yeah
Your treasure lies in your soul
Truth in life will bless ya, it'll bless ya
Riches come and go
Only love is pure gold
Many hearts, many lives have been touched when you realize
That you are worthy, you're a prize
But you have to heal inside
It's a hard world, I know
But don't give in to the lies
You have always been a star
Everything you need's inside your heart
(See 'ya) always on the grind (but cha), need some peace of mind (won't cha)
Slow down, take your time, there's a million ways to shine, yeah (When 'ya)
Let the worldly things (got cha) control your destiny
('Ya gotta) wake up, make a change (and then you'll find your stars will align)
Oooh, your life is special, really special, yeah
Your treasure lies in your soul
Truth in life will bless ya, it'll bless ya
Riches come and go
Only love is pure gold
Oooh, your life is special, really special, yeah
Your treasure lies in your soul
Truth in life will bless ya, it'll bless ya
Riches come and go
Only love is pure gold
Won't you wake up, wake up, walk in the light
Won't you wake up, wake up, bring substance in your life
Won't you wake up, wake up, walk in the light
Won't you wake up, wake up, yeah
Oooh, your life is special, really special, yeah
Your treasure lies in your soul
Truth in life will bless ya, it'll bless ya
Riches come and go
Only love is pure gold
Hey, your love will help you find your treasure, have mercy... yeah
