The way I fix my hair
And paint my eyes
The perfume that I wear
No cheap disguise
Put it all to music
Makes it feel exactly like romance
Well, close enough

Don't it drive you crazy
When you see me dance?

You love these sexy shoes
Oh, my style
I only speak in whispers
With an evil smile
Put it all to music
Make it feel exactly like romance
Ooh, that's close enough

Oh, don't it drive you crazy
When you see me dance?

(Dance for you) Oh, don't it drive you crazy, baby?
(Dance for you) Don't it drive you crazy, baby?
(Dance for you) Don't it drive you crazy, baby?
(Dance for you) Don't it, don't it, don't it drive you crazy, baby?
Don't it drive you crazy?
Don't it drive you crazy?
Don't it drive you crazy when you see me dance?

(Gonna drive you crazy, baby, gonna drive you crazy)
(Gonna drive you crazy, baby, gonna drive you crazy)

I tease you every night
And everywhere
I know I make it hard
But I don't care
Just put it all to music
And make it feel exactly like romance
Ooh, that's close enough

Don't it drive you crazy
When you see me dance?

(Dance for you) Hmm, I'm gonna get next to you
(Dance for you) Oh, I wanna feel you
(Dance for you) Oh, put your lips on my cheek
(Dance for you) Don't it drive you crazy?
Don't it drive you crazy?
Don't it drive you crazy?
Don't it drive you crazy when you see me dance?

(Gonna drive you crazy, baby, gonna drive you crazy)
Don't it drive you crazy when you see me dance? Wanna tease you
(Gonna drive you crazy, baby, gonna drive you crazy)
Oh, don't it drive you crazy when you see me dance?
(Gonna drive you crazy, baby, gonna drive you crazy)
(Gonna drive you crazy, baby, gonna drive you crazy)

(Gonna drive you crazy, baby, gonna drive you crazy)
(Gonna drive you crazy, baby, gonna drive you crazy)
(Dance for you) Gonna get crazy, baby
(Dance for you) Ooh, I'm gonna do it to you
(Dance for you) Do anything you want me to
(Dance for you) Gonna shake my hips
(Dance for you) Touch your body, baby, let me feel you close to me
(Dance for you) I'ma drive you crazy, gonna drive you crazy
(Dance for you) Hm, oh, uh-huh
(Dance for you) Take off your socks, baby, I don't like socks in bed
Don't it drive you crazy when you see me dance?
Oh, baby, wanna dance for you now
Don't it drive you crazy when you see me dance?
Oh, don't it, don't it, don't it
