4:00 AM is way too early
I slept again with the lights turned on
This routine's been goin' on for too long
How to tell why I let you down
Did you know what was goin' on?
I feel so strange, now I don't know what to do
I'm disturbed and I refused to see
Now it's all coming back at me
I feel lost and it's all my fault
I feel lonely, wanna call you up
Knowing all this is got to stop
I can't keep it all to myself
Time has come to try something else
It's cold in here and the aircon's broken
No word from you and it's wearing me down
I've been away from home for way too long
I'm disturbed and I refused to see
Now it's all coming back at me
I feel lost and it's all my fault
I feel lonely, wanna call you up
Knowing all this is got to stop
I can't keep it all to myself
I feel lost and it's all my fault
I feel lonely, wanna call you up
Knowing all this is got to stop
I can't keep it all to myself
Time has come to try something else
I feel lost and it's all my fault
I feel lonely, wanna call you up
Knowing all this is got to stop
I can't keep it all to myself
I feel lost and it's all my fault
I feel lonely, wanna call you up
Knowing all this is got to stop
I can't keep it all to myself
Time has come to try, time has come to try
Time has come to try something else
