(This is the return of the blues cowboy)
Well, well howdy I'm in from prairie area 59
Been traveling with the ghosts of the aliens
Y'know from deep down inside the mine of time
You can dig at that radioactive rock face
You hit the vein of the Blues Cowboy every time
In every flake of granite you can mine
Well, well, I'll tell nobody was pleased to see him back
When he kicked in the snug saloon door
Albeit it he misjudged the swing and he kicked himself onto the floor
Yeah, there sure was a mixed reception
To the comeback of the blues cowboy
From way outta, from way outta
Nineteen hundred and forty-four
But now, somehow he's loose on the streets
In all Chicago you can't knock no coop-house door
Oh, I'm seeing the alleys slink with guitar slingers
Who just don't wanna sling no more
But don't hold your breath, baby
But it's the return of the Blues Cowboy
Front ways back before
Nineteen hundred forty-four
You can pick at the rock face, baby
You'll find a bead of sweat in every pore
Blues Cowboy
