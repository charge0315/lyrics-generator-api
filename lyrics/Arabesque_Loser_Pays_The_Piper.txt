You can fight
Fight with all your might
You are always right
You're a winner
You were never a loser
I love you (baby I love you)
All the things you do (all the things you do)
I must follow you (I must follow you)
Till you meet your Waterloo
For the loser (for the loser)
Pays the piper (pays the piper)
And the loser (and the loser)
Badly needs a friend
For the loser (for the loser)
Pays the piper (pays the piper)
And the loser (and the loser)
May be all alone in the end
Come and dance
Very close to me
Whisper in my ear
All the lovely words
That you only tell me
You love me (baby you love me)
Don't play hide and seek (don't play hite and seek)
'Cause you know too well ('couse you know too well)
Even strong men can be weak
For the loser (for the loser)
Pays the piper (pays the piper)
And the loser (and the loser)
Badly needs a friend
For the loser (for the loser)
Pays the piper (pays the piper)
And the loser (and the loser)
May be lonesome in the end
Kiss me now
Baby tell me how
Do you like it (do you like it)
Do you like it (do you like it)
Oh it feels so good
In this winning mood
I tell you now I claim
I'm gonna win this game
For the loser (for the loser)
Pays the piper (pays the piper)
And the loser (and the loser)
Badly needs a friend
For the loser (for the loser)
Pays the piper (pays the piper)
And the loser (and the loser)
May be all alone in the end
For the loser (for the loser)
Pays the piper (pays the piper)
And the loser (and the loser)
Badly needs a friend
For the loser (for the loser)
Pays the piper (pays the piper)
And the loser (and the loser)
May lonesome in the end
For the loser (for the loser)
Pays the piper (pays the piper)
And the loser (and the loser)
Badly needs a friend
For the loser (for the loser)
Pays the piper (pays the piper)
And the loser (and the loser)
Badly needs a friend
