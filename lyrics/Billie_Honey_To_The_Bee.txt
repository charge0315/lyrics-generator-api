Mmm, mmm, mmm, come on, buzz me up to heaven baby
Mmm, mmm, mmm, come on, buzz me up to heaven

I've been missing you, I should be kissing you
Honey to the bee, that's you for me
I wouldn't tell a lie, got a love I can't deny
Honey to the bee, that's you for me
Honey to the bee, that's you for me
Honey to the bee

I close my eyes and I see you clear
It feels like you're lying here (Na, na, na)
All the things I want to say come and go
Easy as a breeze, those words just flow (Na, na, na)
I float on air, light as any feather
Your love so sweet like an open flower
I'm dizzy from the time we spend together
I need that honey drip every hour

I'm thinking about your sugar lips
Got a feeling for you now that's so strong
I'm dreaming of the candy in your fingertips
Baby don't stay away from me too long

I've been missing you, I should be kissing you
Honey to the bee, that's you for me
I wouldn't tell a lie, got a love I can't deny
Honey to the bee, that's you for me
Honey to the bee, that's you for me
Honey to the bee

Mmm, mmm, mmm, come on, buzz me up to heaven baby
Mmm, mmm, mmm, come on, buzz me up to heaven

You make me smile, but you're far away
I hear your voice like it was yesterday (Na, na, na)
All the things you do they make me feel so fine
I got to tell the world about a love that's mine (Na, na, na)
These wings to fly are gonna last forever
'Cause one by one my dreams come true
And I touch the sky whenever we're together
I can't believe the joy I get with you

I'm thinking about your sugar lips
Got a feeling for you now that's so strong
I'm dreaming of the candy in your fingertips
Baby don't stay away from me too long

I've been missing you, I should be kissing you
Honey to the bee, that's you for me
I wouldn't tell a lie, got a love I can't deny
Honey to the bee, that's you for me
I've been missing you, I should be kissing you
Honey to the bee, that's you for me
I wouldn't tell a lie, got a love I can't deny
Honey to the bee, that's you for me
Honey to the bee, that's you for me
Honey to the bee

Come on and fuck me (to heaven)
(Heaven) You're the only one who can get me there
(Heaven) When you gonna hear my prayer, yeah
(Heaven) You're the only one who can get me there
(Heaven) When you gonna hear my prayer, yeah

I'm thinking about your sugar lips
Got a feeling for you now that's so strong
I'm dreaming of the candy in your fingertips
Baby baby don't stay away from me too long

I've been missing you, I should be kissing you
Honey to the bee, that's you for me
I wouldn't tell a lie, got a love I can't deny
Honey to the bee, that's you for me
I've been missing you, I really should be kissing you
Honey to the bee, that's you for me
I wouldn't tell a lie, got a love I can't deny
Honey to the bee, that's you for me

Honey to the bee, that's you for me
Honey to the bee, that's you for me
Yeah, you for me
