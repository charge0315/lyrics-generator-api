Oh Mary, don't you weep, don't you mourn, oh Mary don't you weep don't you morn, Pharaoh's army got drownded
Oh Mary, don't you weep!
Mary wore three links of chain, and every link was Jesus name, Pharaoh's army got drownded, oh Mary don't you weep!
God told Noah bout the rainbow sing, he said, "no more water, but fire next time!" Pharaoh's army got drownded, Oh Mary
Don't you weep!
One of these days about half past twelve, this old worlds gonna roll and rock, Pharaoh's army got drownded, Oh Mary don't you
Weep!
