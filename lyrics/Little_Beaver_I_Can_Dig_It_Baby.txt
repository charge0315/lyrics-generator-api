And have yourself a little fun
Well, I can dig it baby

To find out what life's all about

Oh, I can dig it baby, yeah yeah
Although you stay out late at night
And wear your dresses way too tight
Well, I can dig it baby, alright

Livin' it up and gettin' it on

So independent and on your own
Oh, I can dig it baby, yeah

And don't know what you do to me
But whatever it is, I can dig it baby

Spread your love all over town

Oh, you say you wanna hang out
Find out what love's all about
