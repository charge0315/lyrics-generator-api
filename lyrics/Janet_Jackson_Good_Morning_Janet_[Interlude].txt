Kyoko, is that you?
Yes
That's you, come in
Good morning, Miss Janet
How are you feeling today?
I feel so much better now
Thank you, Kyoko
Do you want to talk about it, Miss Janet?
No, this time I'd move on to bigger and better things
I can tell you feel like you still miss him
No, I mean, uhm
I don't know
It was incredible while it lasted
But I know that I can just do so much better
