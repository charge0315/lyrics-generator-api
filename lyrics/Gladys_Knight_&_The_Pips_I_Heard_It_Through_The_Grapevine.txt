Mmm, I bet you're wondering how I knew
Baby, baby, baby, about your plans to make me blue (How)
With some other girl you knew before
Between the two of us girls, you know I love you more
It took me by surprise I must say
When I found out yesterday

Don't you know that I heard it through the grapevine
(Oh, I heard it through the grapevine)
Not much longer would you be mine
(Not much longer would you be mine)
Oh, don't you know that I heard it through the grapevine
(Oh, I heard it through the grapevine)
And I'm just about, just about, just about to lose my mind
Oh yes, I am
(Oh yes, I am; oh, yes, I am; oh, yes, I am)
Baby, won't you listen to me

Boy, take a good look at these tears of mine
Baby, baby, these tears I can't hold inside
Losing you would end my life, you see
Because you mean that much to me
You could've told me yourself
That you love somebody else

Instead I heard it through the grapevine
(Oh, I heard it through the grapevine)
Oh, not much longer you be mine
(Not much longer would you be mine)
Don't you know that I heard it (Heard it)
Yes, I heard it (Heard it through the grapevine)
Oh, just about, just about, just about to lose my mind
Oh yes, I am
(Oh yes, I am; oh, yes, I am; oh, yes, I am)

Go-o-o-o-o, go
Go, I gotta go
Whoa, whoa, if you gonna let me go
Whoa-whoa-whoa, I gotta go
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa, I gotta go

Say believe half of what you see (Yes, I heard it)
Oh, ho, and none of what you hear (Yes, I heard it)
Baby, but I just can't help being confused (Yes, I heard it)
If it's true please baby, won't you tell me, dear (Yes, I heard it)
Oh, do you plan to let me go?
For the other girl you loved before?

Don't you know that I heard through the grapevine
(Oh, I heard it through the grapevine)
Not much longer you be mine
(Not much longer would you be mine)
Don't you know that I heard it (Heard it)
Yes, I heard it (Heard it through the grapevine)
Oh, I heard it (Heard it)
Heard it (Heard it, heard it through the grapevine)
