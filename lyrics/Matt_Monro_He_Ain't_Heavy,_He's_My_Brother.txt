The road is long
With many a winding turn
That leads us to who knows where
Who knows where?
But I'm strong
Strong enough to carry him
He ain't heavy, he ain't heavy, he's my brother
So on we go
His welfare is my concern
No burden is he to bear
We'll get there
For I know
That he would not encumber me
He ain't heavy, he ain't heavy, he's my brother
If I'm laden at all
I am laden with sadness
That everyone's heart
Isn't filled with the gladness of love
For one another
It's a long long road
From which there is no return
While we're on the way to bear
We'll get there
And the road
Doesn't wear me down at all
He ain't heavy, he ain't heavy
He's my brother
