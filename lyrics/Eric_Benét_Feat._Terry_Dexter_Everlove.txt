I never thought it was possible
In my reality
I thought my chances for love were gone
That time ran out for me
My heart has been through some Changes
And heaven knows
What I thought was my everlove
Was so conditional
But my love everyday with you I'm
So surprised
Morning comes I fall in love again
Each night I'm thanking GOD you're
In my life
I don't know how I know but this feeling
Won't be ending
Everlove oh my everlove
Ever lasting through all changes in Our lives
Everlove you're my everlove
Ever growing everyday and every night
I found my everlove
I'll never ask for perfection
That's how a love can slip away
I only ask for the truth
In your heart the
Rest we'll work out day by day
You've seen the best and worst of me
And you're still standing here
Oh, there is nothing
That can stop us now
Cause' we've got nothing left to fear
The future will show
The power in a moment just like this
Whatever love can dream we both Will know
Whatever we imagine will exist
With every kiss I swear my life will be
Deserving of you
Everlove, oh everlove
Everlasting through all changes in Our lives
Everlove, you're my everlove
Ever giving, ever
Learning with every cry
I found, my ever love
The winds of changes will blow
(come what may)
Your friends may come may go
(I'll never go away)
These struggles of life they my put us
Through the fire
But as long as I'm alive
I'll be right there
By your side
Everlove oh my everlove
Ever lasting through all changes in Our lives
Everlove you're my everlove
Ever growing everyday and every night
I never know that love
Could feel this way
Let's share a life of love together baby
Everlasting through all
Changes in our lives
Come what may I'm gonna be here With you
Love you forever till my life is through
Ever giving ever learning with every cry
I found my everlove
