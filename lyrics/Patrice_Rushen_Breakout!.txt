Read the paper and watch the news
Now you got the blues
But you can't let it get to you
You just got to move

It's easy to set yourself free
Breakout! Breakout! Come on!
Be you - the best you can be
Breakout! Breakout! Come on!

Now I know that times are rough
You can be a slave
To the problems of the world
Who do you save?

It's easy to set yourself free
Breakout! Breakout! Come on!
Be you - the best you can be
Breakout! Breakout! Come on!

If you're down (Please, set)
If you're down so low (Set yourself free)
Breakout! Breakout! Come on!
If you're down (Be you)
If you're down so low (The best you can be)
Breakout! Breakout! Come on!

Someone's gotta start somewhere
Love yourself and go from there
When the world is gettin' to you
There's only one thing you can do
Breakout!

Ohh
Breakout! Come on
Ohh
Breakout! Come on

If you're down, if you're down so low
Breakout! Breakout! Come on!
If you're down, if you're down so low (Down so low)
(You got to) Breakout! Breakout! Come on!
If you're down, if you're down so low (Down so low)
(You got to) Breakout! Breakout! Come on!
If you're down, if you're down,  if you're down so low
Breakout! Breakout! Come on!

Goodbye
Breakout! Come on!
Come on
Breakout! Come on!
Breakout! Breakout! Come on!
Breakout! Breakout! Come on!
Breakout! Breakout! Come on!
