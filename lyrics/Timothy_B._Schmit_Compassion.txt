Schmit
It's amazing how it's all worked out
I am living like a king
It's a wonder that I'm here at all
Now I don't need a thing
I'm existing somewhat in a shell
In a time so full of rage
And I constantly remind myself
How quickly things could change
Oh, out of my head
I know it's true
Sometimes I forget
And I'm so confused
If I see the world as it really is
And it makes me want to run
All I really need is a simple dose of compassion
If I were you I'd take a break
And step down from your throne
You must get dizzy way up there
Sitting all alone
But who am I to criticize?
I've so much work to do
It's not your fault if I'm unkind
And acting like a fool
Oh, out of my head
I know it's true
Sometimes I forget
And I'm so confused
If I see the world as it really is
And it makes me want to run
All I really need is a simple dose of compassion
I could be your lover, be your friend
I could be your enemy
I could say cruel things about your life
But that won't help me see
That there's a smoother road, a softer bed
There's a cleaner breath of air
And it's time well spent to do our best
To find this love affair
If I see the world as it really is
And it makes me want to run
All I really need is a simple dose of compassion
