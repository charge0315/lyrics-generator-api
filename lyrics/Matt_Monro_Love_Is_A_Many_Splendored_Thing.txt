Love is a many-splendored thing
It's the April rose that only grows in the early Spring
Love is nature's way of give a reason to be living:
The golden crown that makes man a king
Once on a high and windy hill
In the morning mist, two lovers kissed
And the world stood still
Then your fingers touched my silent heart and taught it how to sing
Yes, true love's a many-splendored thing!
Once on a high and windy hill
In the morning mist, two lovers kissed
And the world stood still
Then your fingers touched my silent heart and taught it how to sing
Yes, true love's a many-splendored thing!
