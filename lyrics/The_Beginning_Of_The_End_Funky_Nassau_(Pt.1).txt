We've got a doggone beat now, we're gonna call our very own, uh
Nassau rock and Nassau roll
Nassau's got a whole lot of soul
Uh!
Feel alright
Mini skirts, maxi skirts and Afro hairdo
People are doin' their own thing, they don't care about me or you
Nassau has gone funky, Nassau's got soul, now, oh yeah
And we've got a doggone beat, now, we're gonna take care of business too
Listen to the drummer play in his feet
Listen to the bass man, go get that same groovy beat
Listen to the guitar, give that soul some too
Horn, bringin' on the horns to you
Ain't it funky now?
