City sidewalks, busy sidewalks
Dressed in holiday style
In the air there's a feeling of Christmas!
Children laughing, people passing
Meeting smile after smile
And on every street corner you will hear

Silver bells, silver bells
It's Christmas time in the city
Ring-a-ling, hear them ring
Soon it will be Christmas day

City street lights, even stop lights
Blink of bright red an' green
As the shoppers rush home with their treasures!
Hear the snow crunch, see the kids bunch
This is Santa's big scene
And above all the bustle you will hear

Silver bells, silver bells
It's Christmas time in the city
Ring-a-ling, hear them ring
Soon it will be Christmas day
