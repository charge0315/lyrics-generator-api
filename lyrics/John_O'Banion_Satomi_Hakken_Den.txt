You and I didn't see the evenings fly
There was magic in the air
With time enough to spare
Now in hours I have to say goodbye
Well, you know I have to go
But still it hurts me so
I don’t want this night to end
Don't say goodbye
Just hold me close, my darling
I don't want this night to end
Pretend awhile
And let’s forget tomorrow
Feeling blue, I can see it in your eyes
But I've got a job to do
Got to see things through
But I'll be near even when I am out of sight
Counting seconds 'til the day
I'm coming home to stay
I don't want this night to end
Don't say goodbye
Just hold me close, my darling
I don't want this night to end
Pretend awhile
And let’s forget tomorrow
Oh, my darling, love me tonight
And chase the morning shadows
With your heavenly light
I find my strength inside your arms
So love me tonight and keep my heart beside you
When you go, oh
I don’t want this night to end
Don't say goodbye
Just hold me close, my darling
I don’t want this night to end
Pretend awhile
And let's forget tomorrow
I don't want this night to end
Don't say goodbye
Just hold me close, my darling
I don’t want this night to end
Pretend awhile
And let's forget tomorrow
I don't want this night to end
