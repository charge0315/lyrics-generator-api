Heaven loves ya
The clouds part for ya
Nothing stands in your way when you're a boy
Clothes always fit ya
Life is a pop of the cherry when you're a boy

(When you're a boy) You can wear a uniform
(When you're a boy) Other boys check you out
(You get a girl) These are your favorite things
When you're a boy

Boys
Boys
Boys keep swinging
Boys always work it out

Uncage the colours, unfurl the flag
Luck just kissed you hello
When you're a boy
They'll never clone you, you are always first on the line
When you're a boy

(When you're a boy) You can buy a home of your own
(When you're a boy) Learn to drive and everything
You'll get your share
When you're a boy

Boys
Boys
Boys keep swinging
Boys always work it out
