There are some nights I hold onto every note I ever wrote
Some nights, I say "fuck it all" and stare at the calendar
Waiting for catastrophes, imaginin' they'd scare me
Into changin' whatever it is I am changin' into
And you have every right to be scared

'Cause there are some nights I hold you close, pushin' you to hold me
Or beggin' you to lock me up, never let me see the world
Some nights, I live in horror of people on the radio
Tea parties and Twitter, I've never been so bitter

And you, why you wanna stay?
Oh my God! Have you listened to me lately?
Lately, I've been goin' crazy (So crazy)
And you, why you wanna stay?
Oh my God! Have you listened to me lately?
Lately, I've been fucking crazy

There are some nights I wait for someone to save us
But I never look inward, try not to look upward
And some nights I pray a sign is gonna come to me
But usually
I'm just tryin' to get some sleep

Some nights!
