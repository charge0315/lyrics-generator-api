Love, like a road that never ends
How it leads me back again
To heartache, I'll never understand
Darling I put my heart upon the shelf
'Til the moment was right
'Cause I told myself

Next time I fall in love
I'll know better what to do
Next time I fall in love
The next time I fall in love
Next time I fall in love
It will be with you

Now, as I look into your eyes
Well I wonder if it's wise
To hold you
Like I've wanted to before
'Cause tonight
I was thinking that you might
Be the one who breathes life
In this heart again

Next time I fall in love
I'll know better what to do
Next time I fall in love
The next time I fall in love
Next time I fall in love
It will be with you

Next time I'm gonna follow through
And if it drives me crazy
I will know better why
The next time I try

Next time I fall in love
I'll know better what to do
Next time I fall in love
The next time I fall in love
Next time I fall in love
It will be with you
