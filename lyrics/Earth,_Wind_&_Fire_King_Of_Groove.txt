Everybody wants to be a star
Everybody wants to be accepted by the mass
Everybody wants to be raging fire
But their heat don't last
Everybody wanna peek into my dreams
They try to figure out if I'm just full of jive
Everybody wanna ride in my limousine
But nobody wants to drive

But I'm the King
I'm the King of Groove
Yes I'm the King (yep, he the King)
I'm the King of Groove (he's the King of Groove)
I can't lose
(Yo, summon the royal brass)
Everybody want a piece of the pie
But they'll take a pass if it's a case of do or die
The greener syndrome is at hand
Will they kick a beeline or come forth and take a stand?
If you're wishing on a star
Ooo, I pray your wishes bring you to receive the call
King of Groove is going far, yeah
And in my kingdom there is room for all

'Cause I'm the King
I'm the King of Groove (he's the King of Groove)
Yes, I'm the King (he be the King)
I'm the King of Groove

King of Groove
I can't lose
Stand back and watch my moves
'Cause I'm the King of Groove

I'm the King (yep, he the King)
Yeah, I'm the King (he be the King)
I'm the King of Groove
He's the King of Groove
He's the King of Groove

Well, you've got your
This of that and your that of this
With the King of Groove, baby, you can't miss
You got your Joan of Arc
And your house of wax
But with the King of Groove
You'll be jammin' back
You got your Dukes of Hazzard and your Duke of Earl
And the Queen of Sheba, she was one bad girl
Aretha Franklin, she's the Queen of Soul
But the King of Groove
Is in control
He's got the Lord of Lords
And the King of Kings
He keeps the King of Groove
Doing his thing, doing his thing, yeah
You can't stop him
No matter what you do
'Cause you're dealing with
The King of Groove
