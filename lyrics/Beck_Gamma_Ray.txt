If I could hold, hold out for now
But with these icecaps meltin' down
With the transistor sound
And my Chevrolet Terraplane
Goin' around, around, around

Come on, little gamma ray
Standin' in a hurricane
Your brains are bored like a refugee from a house that's burnin'
And the heat wave's calling your name

She's got a cactus crown
With a dot, dot, dot on her brow
And she speaks inside a cloud
With her countenance turnin' around

It hit me like a gamma ray
Standin' in a hurricane
And I'm pullin' out thorns, smokestack lightnin' out my window
I want to know what I've lost today

Come on little gamma ray
Standin' in a hurricane
And your body's bored like a refugee from a house that's burnin'
And the backwater's callin' your name
