I'm telling you now, it's the only way how
Just thinking about it
I just want to be with you
'Cause every time I see your smile
I just wanna be here with you
My feelings never change
They still remain the same
What are you all about
Let's try and work things out
We're going round and round
A truth that must be found
No matter what you say this love affair is real
No matter where you go
(My love for you will always show)
No matter how you feel
(You need to show your love is real)
I'm telling you now
It's the only way how
Just thinking about it
I just want to be with you
'Cause every time I see your smile
I just wanna be here with you
Just take me in your arms
So I can feel your charms
Your sweet caress at night
To have not once but twice
I guess you know by now
Where true love can be found
Don't ever turn away
For my love is here to stay
My heart is waiting here
(For you to hold and to be near)
No matter what you say
(We can take it day by day)
I'm telling you now
It's the only way how
Just thinking about it
I just want to be with you
'Coz every time I see your smile
I just wanna to be here with you
I just wanna hold you in my arms
So we can feel secure
And I'll never ever ever let go
'Cause you and I won't know
Until we have a good go
So tell me you will
And my heart will be fulfilled
I'm telling you now
It's the only way how
Just thinking about it
I just want to be with you
'Cause every time I see you smile
I just wanna be here with you
I wanna be here with you baby
Oh, I need you baby
Thinking about it
I wanna be here baby
'Cause every time I see your smile
I just wanna be here with you
I wanna be here with you baby
I wanna be here with you baby
Thinking thinking thinking about it
Every time I see your smile
I just wanna be here
I'm telling you now
It's the only way how
Just thinking about it
I just want to be with you
'Cause every time I see you smile
I just wanna be here with you
