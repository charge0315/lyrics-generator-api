You can have your space

I think I'm too close for comfort, where did I go wrong?
Nothing ever seems to come out right
You tell me that you need me as you're walking out the door
I wish you woulda stayed just one more night

Tell me, do you even ever think about me anymore?
Was I last to know we're just a waste of time?
I called your phone, it says to leave a message at the tone
"Unavailable," yeah, I know that's a lie

You can have your space
And I'll just go away
What am I supposed to say, say, say, say
When you come back to me, me, me, me?
Yeah, you can have your space

I didn't think I wanted more than you inside my bed
I guess we never shoulda come this far
And now I wonder who's the guy that you just call a friend
Even when I'm still up in your head

Tell me, do you even ever think about me anymore?
Was I last to know we're just a waste of time?
I called your phone, it says to leave a message at the tone
"Unavailable," yeah, I know that's a lie

You can have your space
And I'll just go away
What am I supposed to say, say, say, say
When you come back to me, me, me, me?
Yeah, you can have your space

Don't tell me that you want me
Don't tell me that you need me
Don't tell me that you miss me
'Cause you're asking me for space
Don't tell me that you want me
Don't tell me that you need me
Don't tell me that you miss me
'Cause you're asking me for space

Yeah, you can have your space (You can have your space)
And I'll just go away (I'll just go away)
What am I supposed to say, say, say, say (What am I supposed to say)
When you come back to me, me, me, me? (When you come back to me?)
Yeah, you can have your space
