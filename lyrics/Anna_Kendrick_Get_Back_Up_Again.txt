I really hope I can do it
'Cause they're all depending on me
I know that I must leave the only home I've ever known
And brave the dangers of the forest
Saving them before they're eaten
I mean, how hard can that be?

Looking up at a sunny sky, so shiny and blue
And there's a butterfly
Well, isn't that a super fantastic sign?
It's gonna be a fantastic day
Such marvelousness it's gonna bring
Gotta pocket full of songs that I'm gonna sing
And I'm ready to take on anything, hooray
Some super fun surprise around each corner
Just riding on a rainbow, I'm gonna be okay

Hey, I'm not giving up today
There's nothing getting in my way
And if you knock, knock me over
I will get back up again
Oh, If something goes a little wrong
Well, you can go ahead and bring it on
'Cause if you knock, knock me over
I will get back up again
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, get back up again
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh, ahh!

I'm marching along, I've got confidence
I'm cooler than a pack of peppermints
And I haven't been this excited since
I can't remember when
I'm off on this remarkable adventure
Just riding on a rainbow

What if it's all a big mistake?
What if it's more than I can take?
No, I can't think that way 'cause I know
That I’m really, really, really gonna be okay

Hey, I'm not giving up today
There's nothing getting in my way
And if you knock, knock me over
I will get back up again
Oh, If something goes a little wrong
Well, you can go ahead and bring it on
'Cause if you knock, knock me over
I will get back up again
(Get up, get up, get up)
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, get back up again
(Get up, get up, get up)
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh, I'm okay

(Get up, get up, get up)
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh
And if you knock, knock me over; knock, knock me over
I will get back up again
