Lonely tonight, lonely tonight, lonely tonight, I'm lonely tonight
Lonely tonight, lonely tonight, lonely tonight, I'm lonely tonight

We're enchanted, struck by lightning
What can we do when the feeling's so exciting?
We just ran into each other
Now we can't refuse, 'cause the night is so inviting
You sure took me by surprise, I ain't fooling
Everything was synchronized in a movement (Really?)
When I met you, I knew there was a reason (Tonight)
Every moment that we've shared guarantees it

We, we won't be lonely tonight (Lonely tonight, tonight)
Must be miles ago since we first said "hello"
We, we won't let us out of our sights (Lonely tonight, tonight)
Passion has to grow, darling because we know
Riding our tide, luck is with us
We know the risk, when we've got so much to give us
Fate's on our side and it's our moment
We're getting warm, 'cos we give each other shivers

Yeah, let's keep the fire alight (Lonely tonight, tonight)
Nothing can go wrong, we're together for now on (Lonely tonight, I'm lonely tonight)
Oh, all the love we excite (Lonely tonight, lonely tonight)
Loneliness has gone, did it take us so long (Lonely tonight, I'm lonely tonight)
Can't remember life without your music
Oh, there never was a doubt, don't we prove it? (Really?)
You sure took me by surprise, I ain't fooling
Everything is synchronized in a movement

Hey, now we're enchanted, stuck by lightning
What can we do when the feeling's so exciting?
We just ran into each other
Now we can't refuse, 'cause the night is so inviting

We won't be lonely tonight (Lonely tonight, tonight)
Must be miles ago since we first said "hello" (Lonely tonight, I'm lonely tonight)
We won't let us out of our sights (Lonely tonight, lonely tonight)
Passion has to grow, darling because we know (Lonely tonight, I'm lonely tonight)
Yeah, let's keep the fire alight (Lonely tonight, lonely tonight)
Nothing can go wrong, we're together for now on (Lonely tonight, I'm lonely tonight)
Oh, all the love we excite (Lonely tonight, lonely tonight)
Loneliness has gone, did it take us so long (Lonely tonight, I'm lonely tonight)
(Lonely tonight, lonely tonight, lonely tonight, I'm lonely tonight)
(Lonely tonight...)
