Ooh, oh

You're wondering if
I care about ya'
Is there some cause
That I should doubt ya' (Oh)
Oh, I can see, boy
That you don't know me very well
Uh-uh, you're so unsure
And you run here and there
To ask my feelings
Friends only guess
They can't say really, oh

Don't ask my neighbors
Don't my the friends I hang around
(Never ask the friends I hang around)
Uh uh, don't be afraid
To come to me (Come to me)
Don't ask my neighbors

Come to me (Come to me)
Don't be afraid of
What you'll see (What you'll see)
You'll find I love you (Ooh, I love you)
Come to me (Come to me)
Don't be afraid

You ask all my friends
If I'm the same, boy
You don't understand
You think I'm changing, oh

Don't ask my neighbors
(Don't ask my neighbor)
Don't ask my friends I hang around
(Never ask the friends I hang around)
Uh-uh (no) don't be afraid
(Never) to come to me (Come on)
Don't ask my neighbors (Ooh, ooh)
Come to me (Come on, come on)
Don't be afraid, of what you'll see
(I'll make you feel at ease, baby)
You'll find I love you (Ooh, ooh)
Come to me (Come on)
Don't be afraid

I, I will, ooh.....
Don't ask my neighbors
Come to me (Come on)
Don't be afraid of what you'll see
You'll find I love you
Come to me (Baby)
Don't be afraid
Hurry, come to me
Come to me, come to me
Don't ask my neighbors
(I'll be real) come to me
Don't be afraid of what you'll see
You'll find I love you
Come to me, don't be afraid
I'll be waiting baby
It's been a long time
