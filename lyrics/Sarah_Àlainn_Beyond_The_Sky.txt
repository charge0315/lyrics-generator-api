Verse 1
Tell me why, the reason I am here
Just only you I see from far away
I've come for you
Don't know why, I searched all night and day
But when I'm here, darkness came
No lights to show the way
Dark despair, still I seek for you
All I long to see was your smile
Chorus
I know I won't look behind, I see no regrets
No guiding lights so dark, are you my light?
But now I am here, and you're close to me
My heart is with you, forever and ever...

Verse 2
See this place, the end of world she fears
No shining lights anywhere
This emptiness in tears
Didn't know
It was you all along
You were chasing after my shadows
Chorus
I know I won't look behind, I see no regrets
No guiding lights so dark, are you my light?
But now I am here, and you're close to me
My heart is with you, forever and ever...
(Verse 2 first time; ending second time)
Ending
No I won't let you go, I will hold it in my arms
Oh! This light was you!
Chorus
I know it now, beyond the sky
There's new place you'll see
I came to you to share our dream together
I won't let us part, there's no place to be
My heart is with you, forever and ever...
