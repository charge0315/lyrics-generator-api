Back when all my little goals seemed so important
Every pot of gold feeling full of distortion
Heaven was a place still in space, not in motion
But soon

I got you
I got everything, I've got you
I don't need nothing more than you
I got everything, I've got you

We went walking through the hills trying to pretend that we both know
Maybe if we save up we could build a little home
But then the hailstorm came, it yelled
"You need to let go, you got no control", no

I got you
I got everything, I've got you
I don't need nothing more than you
I got everything, I've got you

This weight's too much alone
Some days I can't hold it at all
You take it on for me
When tomorrow's too much, I'll carry it all, I got you
Yeah, when tomorrow's too much, I'll carry it all, I got you

I got you
I got everything, I've got you
I don't need nothing more than you
I got everything, I've got you
