Bust the new jam
Bust it like this
Ten o'clock, in my ride
Drivin' down the 95
Gettin' to my baby's house
Is all that I can think about
Champagne, moonlight
It's gonna be a lovers' night
Anticipation is in the air
And all I want to do is share my love
Girl, I'm never gonna give you up (aw, baby)
All I wanna do is fill you up (with love)
I can never get enough (get enough)
All I wanna do is fill you up (with love)
Deep inside of me it's building up (aw, baby)
All I wanna do is fill you up (with love)
I can never, ever get enough (get enough)
All I wanna do is fill you up
All alone, cuddled up
TV off, the music's soft
Fingers up and down my spine
And that's when things intensify
Kiss me here (kiss me)
Touch me there (touch me right there)
Your body turns me on, I swear
Can't resist, I want you much
Come here let me fill you up with love
Girl, I'm never gonna give you up (aw, baby)
All I wanna do is fill you up (with love)
I can never get enough (get enough)
All I wanna do is fill you up (with love)
Deep inside of me it's building up (aw, baby)
All I wanna do is fill you up (with love)
I can never, ever get enough (get enough)
All I wanna do is fill you up
Girl you know you're
(Always)
On my mind
(Day and night)
Anytime
(That you need)
Some tender love
(I'll be there)
To fill you up with love
