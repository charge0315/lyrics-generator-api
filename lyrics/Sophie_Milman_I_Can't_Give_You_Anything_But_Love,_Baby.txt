I can't give you anything but love, baby
Love's the one thing I got plenty of, baby
Dreaming awhile, scheming awhile, you're sure to find
Happiness, and I guess, all those things you always pined for
Gee, it's nice to see you looking swell, baby
Diamond bracelets Woolworth's doesn't sell, ooh baby
But until that lucky day you know damned well, my baby
I can't give you anything but love
I can't give you anything but love, my baby
Love's the one thing I got plenty of, baby
Dreaming awhile, scheming awhile, you're sure to find
Happiness, and I guess, all those things you always pined for
Gee, it's nice to see you looking swell, baby
Diamond bracelets Woolworth's doesn't sell, oh baby
And until that lucky day you know damned well, baby
I can't give you anything but love

I can't give you anything but love, baby
Love's the one thing I got plenty of, oh baby
Dreaming awhile, scheming awhile, you're sure to find
Happiness, and I guess, all those things you've always pined for
Gee, it's nice to see you looking swell, baby
Diamond bracelets Woolworth's doesn't sell, baby
And until that lucky day you know damned well, my baby
I can't give you anything
I can't give you anything
I can't give you anything but love
