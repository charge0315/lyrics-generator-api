Mmm... hm-hmmm...
You know a kiss like that
Could really start something this evening
Tonight, I want you to go with me
It's your kind of place, it's very romantic
It's our kind of place
You know how you sitting there looking so beautifully
Lady and I, baby I really wanna feel your fire
I wanna see your passion, I... mm
Baby believe me, a kiss like that could really start something
I wanna take you there
I wanna be with you, and only you, there
Baby... trust me

There's a secret place
It's a love's hideaway
And it's not that far from here
Just imagine taking a ride
Streaking across the sky
And playing music as we fly
You would love the place where I go
It's the only place I know
Where we can lose all track of time
Loving each other, over and over again
Giving it all from within
Over and over, and over and over again

There is a place
Where love just never ends
Can I show you just how it all begins?
Oh, it's magic, and also free
Time is precious for it, and endless memories
There is a place
Where passion love never ends
Let me show you, just how we can begin
Ooh, it's wonderful, and I really need to know
How far do you wanna take it?
How far do you want to go?

There's a place like you've got here
A seductive atmosphere
And it's not that far away
It's in the other room
And we need to go there soon
'Cause baby, it's the only way to start
Oh, you're gonna love this place
I can see it on your face
And now is a perfect time
For making love, over and over again
Sexual healing within
All that it takes, is for you just to say "let's begin"

There is the place
Where love just never ends
Let me hold you, this is how it all begins
We can make magic, and oh so free
Time is precious for it, and endless memories
There is a place, that only lovers share
Can I show you...?
Oh, I want to take you there
Oh, it's wonderful, but I really need to know
How far do you wanna take it?
How far do you wanna go?
Girl, there is the place... (forever)
Oh, what I would give, just to feel inside of you
Over and over... (over)
I wanna get next to you

Baby we must, it's time for us
To do what comes naturally
And I really don't wanna wait any longer
And I don't think that you do either, I...
I get that feeling from just looking at you
Your face is so ready, and you... you're ready, aren't you?
(There is a place...)
Baby you're ready, I can tell you're ready
And I... and I'm ready too, so let me start here
(There is a place...)
Let me undo this, yeah...
(Oh lord, it's so good, it's so good)
I'll be there in a minute, baby, let me...
Let me do this
(Let me hold you)
Now let me do, this...
(There is a place, where love just never ends)
Look at you... look at you
