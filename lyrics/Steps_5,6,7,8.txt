It's time to begin, now count it in
Five, six, seven, eight

My boot scootin' baby is drivin' me crazy
My obsession from a western, my dance floor date
My rodeo Romeo, a cowboy god from head to toe
Wanna make you mine, better get in line, five, six, seven, eight

My obsession from a western, my dance floor date
My rodeo Romeo, a cowboy god from head to toe
Wanna make you mine, better get in line, five, six, seven, eight

Foot kickin', finger clickin'
Leather slappin', hand clappin'
Hip bumpin', music thumpin'
Knee hitchin', heel and toe
Floor scuffin', leg shufflin'
Big grinnin', body spinnin'
Rompin', stompin', pumpin', jumpin'
Slidin', glidin', here we go

My boot scootin' baby is drivin' me crazy
My obsession from a western, my dance floor date
My rodeo Romeo, a cowboy god from head to toe
Wanna make you mine, better get in line, five, six, seven, eight

Tush pushin', thunder footin'
Cowgirl twistin', no resistin'
Drums bangin', steel twangin'
Two steppin', end to end
Hardwood crawlin', some four wallin'
Rug cuttin', cowboy struttin'
Burnin', yearnin', windin', grindin'
Let's begin the dance again

You're mine, all mine, my Bubba

Gonna rope you in, so count me in, five, six, seven, eight
