Chorus:
I got you under my skin
Oh, sugarbabe hold me down
Oh you, ward off my sins
When they go round and round
Verse 1:
Got a bitch ringing on my phone
I don't want to answer
Messin' with the evils of my nature was a flex, nah
Man, I think I love her
Made it till nirvana
Can't fall back on earth I'm way too way too good in heaven
Easy to  selfdestruct when i feel far from you
I try to work on me, but there's too much to do hmmmm
Chorus:
I got you under my skin
Oh, sugarbabe hold me down
Oh you, ward off my sins
When they go round and round
Verse 2:
SMS, relieving the stress
She my bitch
Oh no she my hess
Latina juice
Drippin down your legs
Boy i'm starting to pity my old self
Making love with no love
Sex with no scrapes
I'd never go brutal
If she wants sweet
And If you trust me
I trust you
We'll keep it true
Chorus:
I got you under my skin
Oh, Sugarbabe hold me down
Oh you, ward off my sins
When they go round and round

Chorus:
I got you under my skin
Oh, Sugarbabe hold me down
Oh you, ward off my sins
When they go round and round
