Baby, you're improvable, it won't take long
Mountains can be movable if the spirit's strong
You've got possibilities, takes a fella to tell
You've got possibilities, let me pry you from your shell
Somewhere way down deep in you there's life no doubt
It's just been asleep in you let me bring it out, yes
You've got possibilities, maybe even a lot
Red hot possibilities, you don't even know you've got
You won't be shy when I get through
I'll make you purr, you pussycat you
Somewhere way down deep in you, thеre's life no doubt
It's just been asleep in you, let mе bring it out yes
You've got possibilities, maybe even a lot
Red hot possibilities, you don't even know you've got
