Hero as he rose
Hero as he rose
Hero as he rose, ahh
Born of love and dream
We have crowned our king
Restoring all things
Heaven and Nature sing
Told to make it right
Be a guiding light
Never lose your sight
Time has come to fight
Hero as he rose
Hero as he rose
Hero as he rose, ahh
Hero as he rose
Hero as he rose
Hero as he rose, ahh
Man wakes from his sleep
Shaking in his sheets
Sick of what he is
Ain't no way to live
Overstands what's wrong
Sees he's long been gone
Now he's back on track
Can't be mad at that
Hero as he rose
Hero as he rose
Hero as he rose, ahh
Hero as he rose
Hero as he rose
Hero as he rose, ahh
Night has come to end
Brand new day begins
Now flowers can grow
He's a hero as he rose
Hero as he rose
Hero as he rose
Hero as he rose, ahh
Hero as he rose
Hero as he rose
Hero as he rose, ahh
