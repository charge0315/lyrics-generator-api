Turn it up, turn it up, turn it up now
Feels good, feels good
Yeah, yeah, now, now

Now, the heat of love feels like it's starting to cool
I hear the bells, but they don't ring the way they used to
It looks like breaking up is our next obvious move
But let's not move too soon, oh no (Oh no)
See, the problem going 'round too often these days
People throwing in the towel once they pass the honeymoon phase
A stronger love awaits if we endure this pain
Or else we've in these years cried these tears in vain
I'm saying

(Don't let go) That's all I'm saying
(Don't let go) Ooh girl, let's stop playing
(No, don't let go) Think of all the love we've been making
(Don't let go) Don't let it go

I've worked your patience, girl, and you working my nerves
We scream at each other, but we're not hearing one word
We've made mistakes that neither one of us deserves
Leaving much desired where love's concerned
I saw an old man and his wife early today
They were holding hands, his eyes locked in her gaze
Think of all the times they came so close to parting ways
In my mind I could hear him say, stay, babe

(Don't let go) I could hear him say
(Don't let go) Don't throw the love away
(No, don't let go) Aren't we worth it, baby?
(Don't let go) Don't let it go
(Don't let go) That's all I'm saying
(Don't let go) Ooh girl, let's stop playing
(No, don't let go) Think of all the love we've been making
(Don't let go) Don't let it go

With some other girl, I could move on
Trading old problems just for new
To some other guy you could belong
Going through changes we've been through
(When another brother is tryna make a play)
Oh no, don't you let go
(When another woman is up in my face)
Oh, I better not let go
(When the honeymoon starts fading away)
Oh no, I won't let go
(If we're gonna make it, I wanna hear you say)
Oh no, I swear I won't let go

(Don't let go) That's all I'm saying
(Don't let go) Ooh girl, let's stop playing
(No, don't let go) Think of all the love we've been making
(Don't let go) Don't let it go
(Don't let go) I wanna hear you say
(Don't let go) Don't throw this love away
(No, don't let go) You know we're worth it, baby
(Don't let go) Don't let it go

No, baby, no, no, don't you let go
(I could hear him say)
No, baby, no, no, don't you let go
(Don't throw the love away)
Every time you feel like you've had enough
(You know we're worth it, baby)
Don't let go
