There's a time for love and a time for healing
You can't go back and undo what's been done
Word of mouth, time is revealing
Just how far we've let this kingdom come
Hand in hand we're finding our way
And today is just tomorrow's yesterday
Some would die for you, some will lie to you
There's all kinds of people in this world, yeah
Turn the world around, tear the borders down
There's all kinds of people in this world, yeah
A kiss of life in the hand of fate
A boy grows up into his father's son
And he learns to love, been taught to hate
To carry on the way it has been done
All our lives, it's debts to repay
Maybe someday we can put the past away
Some would die for you, some will lie to you
There's all kinds of people in this world, yeah
Turn the world around, tear the borders down
There's all kinds of people in this world
All kinds of people in this world
Some would die for you, yeah, some will lie to you
There's all kinds of people in this world, yeah
Put your fear away find a better way
There's all kinds of people in this world, yeah
Yeah, underneath a broken sky
Love will heal the pain inside
In a moment things can change
One look behind and it's never the same
Some would die for you, some will lie to you
There's all kinds of people in this world, yeah
Turn the world around, tear the borders down
There's all kinds of people in this world
All kinds of people in this world
Some would die for you, yeah, some will lie to you
There's all kinds of people in this world
People in this world
