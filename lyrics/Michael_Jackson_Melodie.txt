I woke up yesterday
Knowing I was lost in the past somewhere
I felt my destiny was a sad parade
Going nowhere
When I saw my sweet melody
Like a song, you enchanted me
And the sound of your voice
Made my heart keep time
To the music of a love that filled my mind
Melody, you're a symphony
A love song to me
You're my only
Melody, you're my everything
Make me wanna sing
For ya only
Doo-doo-oo doo-oo dooo-doo ooo-ooo
(I wanna see you love me)
The long and winding road
Is much shorter now that you're here with me
The questions in my mind
Have been answered now that you’ve told me
All the colours are brighter now
And the darkness is lighter now
In my mind, I can hear
The band start to play
Hello, tomorrow
Goodbye, yesterday
Melody, you're my symphony
A love song to me
You're my only
Melody, you're my everything
Make me wanna sing
For ya only
Beautiful morning
Oh, happy day
And you know that it’s music to my ears
Every word that you say-ay-ayyy
Melody, you're a symphony
A love song to me
You're my only
Melody, you're my everything
Make me wanna sing
For ya only
Melody, you're a symphony
A love song to me
You're my only, only
Melody, you're my everything
Make me wanna sing
For ya only
