Too tired to walk, it was a long way from home
The moon froze the night
Too tired to walk, it was a long way from home
The moon froze the night

Switch the channels on my TV
And now the cameras are fixed on me again
I'm running and I'm running and I can't seem to hide
The sky's so red and I'm loosing my mind
I can't get my head to stop this feeling inside
The four walls are coming and I can't get outside
The four walls have come, taking all that's mine
They're stealing my toys, leave no memories behind
Everything's changing, nothing seems the same
They seize all my thoughts, not cars or trains
The thoughts were bought, but they kept me sane
Everything's changing, nothing seems the same

Too tired to walk, it was a long way from home
The moon froze the night
Too tired to walk, it was a long way from home
The moon froze the night

Stare out my window, I'm yearning for more
Bust for my borrowers and settle the score
I want my toys, but the man out there's too hard
Running around, feet on the ground
Can't seem to understand this game they're playing
And no one seems to wanna sit with me

Too tired to walk, it was a long way from home
The moon froze the night
Too tired to walk, it was a long way from home
The moon froze the night
Too tired to walk, it was a long way from home
The moon froze the night
Too tired to walk, it was a long way from home
The moon froze the night
