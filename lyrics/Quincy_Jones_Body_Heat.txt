Can you feel it?
Touching you
Don't you feel it?

My temperature's risin'
And it's not surprisin'
But when you're close to me, girl
It's so tantalizin'
I can't help myself
I get so excited
Why do I act in this fashion?
Why can't I control my passion?

Some call it (Soul) soul fire (Fire)
I call it love's desire
Come on up, I'm gonna take you higher
I'm gonna give you warmth, guaranteed to inspire

When we meet
Ain't it sweet?
And when we greet
Feel that body heat
Feel that body
Can you feel it? Can you feel it? Can you feel it?
Feel that body heat
Feel that body heat
Body heat

Give me your hand
And I'll give you mine (Can you feel it?)
Oh, fire and water
Mixed up in one sign
Touching you
Inside of you, baby

Oh, I like it
I like it a lot
Come on, baby
Give it all you got
I'm gettin' warmer
But just wait 'til I get hot
'Cause I'm a genie nonfiction
Rub me 'til I feel the friction

Some call it... soul fire (Soul fire)
I call it love's desire (Love's desire)
Come on up, I'm gonna take you higher
I'm gonna give you warmth, guaranteed to inspire

When we meet
Feel the heat
Ain't it sweet?
Feel that body heat
(Can't you feel it? Can't you feel it? Can't you feel it?)
Feel that body
(Can't you feel it? Can't you feel it? Can't you feel it, feel it)
Your Fahrenheit is outta sight, it's alright
I dig body heat
(Can't you feel it? Can't you feel it? Can't you feel it?)
I dig body
(Can't you feel it?)
Your centigrade could stand some shade
But that's okay 'cause I dig body heat
I dig body heat
(Feel it, feel it, feel it)
Can you feel it? Can you feel it? Can you feel it?
Feel that body heat
