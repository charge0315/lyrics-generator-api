The sun is shining bright
So somehow it just don't seem right
For raindrops drip down on me
The sun is shining bright
So somehow it just don't seem right
For raindrops drip down on me
Oh girl, how can I make you see
(How can I make you see)
How much you mean to me
(How much you mean to me)
It's rainin' through my sunshine, yeah
I'm livin' in the shadow
(Livin' in the shadow)
Without you here the road is narrow
(The road is narrow)
Without you you've gotten me
Oh girl, I just can't find my way
(I just can't find my way)
It's rainin' through my sunshine
(It's rainin' through my sunshine)
It's rainin' through my sunshine
It's rainin' through my sunshine
(It's rainin' through my sunshine)
It's rainin' through my sunshine
Memories of you just won't go away
Baby without you, I can't face each day
It's rainin' through my sunshine
(It's rainin' through my sunshine, it's rainin' through my sunshine)
It's rainin' through my sunshine
(It's rainin' through my sunshine, it's rainin' through my sunshine)
Come on back to me
I need you so desperately
Without you life just don't seem right
Oh girl, I wanna be with you
(I wanna be with you)
So tell me what to do
(So tell me what to do)
It's rainin' through my sunshine
(It's rainin' through my sunshine)
It's rainin' through my sunshine
It's rainin' through my sunshine
(It's rainin' through my sunshine)
It's rainin' through my sunshine
Memories of you just won't go away
Baby, without you I can't face each day
It's rainin' through my sunshine
(It's rainin' through my sunshine, it's rainin' through my sunshine)
It's rainin' through my sunshine
(It's rainin' through my sunshine, it's rainin' through my sunshine
It's rainin' through my sunshine, it's rainin' through my sunshine
It's rainin' through my sunshine, it's rainin' through my sunshine)
It's rainin' through my sunshine
(It's rainin' through my sunshine, it's rainin' through my sunshine)
It's rainin' through my sunshine
(It's rainin' through my sunshine, it's rainin' through my sunshine)
It's rainin' through my sunshine
(It's rainin' through my sunshine, it's rainin' through my sunshine)
It's rainin' through my sunshine
(It's rainin' through my sunshine, it's rainin' through my sunshine)
It's rainin' through my sunshine
