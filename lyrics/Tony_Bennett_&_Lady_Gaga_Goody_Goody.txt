So you met someone who set you back on your heels
Goody goody (He's a sucker)
So you met someone and now you know how it feels
(Ah, why would you say that?)
Goody goody
So you gave him your heart too
Just as I gave mine to you (Stop talking about this stuff)
And he broke it in little pieces
Now how do you do? (That's really funny Tony)
So you lie awake just singing the blues all night
Goody goody
So you think that love's a barrel of dynamite
(I told you I'm not goody, I'm a baddie)
Hooray and hallelujah
You had it comin' to ya (You think you're funny, huh?)
Goody goody for him
Goody goody for me
(Goody goody for you)
And I hope you're satisfied
You rascal, you
(That's real cheeky, Tony)

So you met someone who set you back on your heels
(So what?)
Goody goody
So you met someone and now you know how it feels
(I was confused, you know?)
Goody goody
So you gave him your heart too
Just as I gave mine to you
And he broke it in little pieces (I know)
Now how do you do?
So you lie awake just singing the blues all night
(Yeah, all night, all night long)
Goody goody
So you think that love's a barrel of dynamite
(Yeah, so what, it is sometimes)
Hooray and hallelujah
You had it comin' to ya (Stop laughin')
Goody goody for him
Goody goody for me
(Hm, I'm not goody, I'm a baddie)
Your love has been denied
You've been taken for a ride
(What, are you happy now?)
And I hope you're satisfied
You rascal, you
(Yeah, I'll be fine, just stop singing that song)
