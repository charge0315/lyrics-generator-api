Wallflower, wallflower
Won't you dance with me?
I'm sad and lonely too

Wallflower, wallflower
Won't you dance with me?
I'm falling in love with you

Just like you, I'm wondering what I'm doing here
Just like you, I'm wondering what's going on

Wallflower, wallflower
Won't you dance with me?
The night will soon be gone

I have seen you standing in the smokey haze
And I know that you're gonna be my one last dance
Mine alone

Wallflower, wallflower
Take a chance on me
Please let me ride you home

Wallflower, wallflower
Won't you dance with me?
I'm sad and lonely too

Wallflower, wallflower
Take a chance on me
I'm falling in love with you
I'm falling in love with you
