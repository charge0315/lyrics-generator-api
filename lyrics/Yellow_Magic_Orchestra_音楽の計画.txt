I want to look at black pictures
And walk in moonlight gardens
I take away some insecurity
Then put it back
No more dried up addiction
No more soured sentiment
Get some military venom
Take it with a pinch of salt

Making music
What the plan
Breaking music

A guerrilla born at winter's end
Spins songs that know no limit
Let's do away with sentiment
Life should be outspoken
Pretty girls and owl-like gods
Just like nature planned it
Pallid seagulls cross bacteria seas
Give back our festivals
Keep men and gods separate
How long can a dream go on
Back to square one, once a day

Making music
What's the plan?
Breaking music
Playing music
What's the plan?
Decaying music
Grooving music
What's the plan?
Losing music
Making music
