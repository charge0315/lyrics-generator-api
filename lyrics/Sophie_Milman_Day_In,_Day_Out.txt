Day in, day out
That same old voodoo follows me about
That same old tumble in my heart, whenever I think of you
And honey I think of you day in and day out
Day out, day in
I needn't tell you how my days begin
When I awake I awake with a tingle, one possibility in view
Possibility of maybe seeing you
Come rain,come shine
I meet you and to me the day is fine
And then I kiss your lips, and the tumble becomes
The oceans roar, a thousand drums
Can't you see its love, can there be any doubt
When there it is, day in day out
Day in, day out
That same old voodoo follows me about
That same old tumble in my heart, whenever I think of you
And honey I think of you day in and day out
Day out, day in
I needn't tell you how my days begin
When I awake I awake with a tingle, one possibility in view
Possibility of maybe seeing you
Come rain,come shine
I meet you and to me the day is fine
And then I kiss your lips, and the tumble becomes
The oceans roar, a thousand drums
Can't you see its love, can there be any doubt
When there it is, day in day out
Come rain,come shine
I meet you and to me the day is fine
And then I kiss your lips, and the tumble becomes
The oceans roar, a thousand drums
Can't you see its love, can there be any doubt
When there it is, day in day out
Day in day out
Day in day out
Day in day out
Day in day out
