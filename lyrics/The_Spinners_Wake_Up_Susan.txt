(Lazy Susan, lazy Susan)
I can't stand to wait a minute longer
There must be some way to let you know
My love is ready
My heart is beating fast
I'm growing weaker
And I don't know
How long I can last
(Wake up) I can't stand to hear
(Lazy Susan, lazy Susan) This early morning
(Wake up) Tossing pebbles
(Lazy Susan, lazy Susan) At your window pane
I'm trying to wake you
I'm tired so all alone
I've got to see you
And I won't believe
That you're not home
Wake up, Susan, don't you know
What you're missing? I'm right here
Wake up, Susan, don't you know
What you're missing? I'm right here
I'm right here (I'm right here)
I can't wait to put my arms around you, baby
Only if it's for a little while (lazy Susan, lazy Susan)
My body's aching
I want you oh so bad
Why can't you hear me?
If you'd just wake up
I'd be so glad
Wake up, Susan, don't you know
What you're missing? I'm right here
Wake up, Susan, don't you know
What you're missing? I'm right here
I'm right here
