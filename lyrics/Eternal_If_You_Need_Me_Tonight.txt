If you need me tonight
(If you need me tonight)
If you need me tonight
(I will be there)
If you need me tonight
(If you need me tonight)
If you need me tonight
(I'll be there)
There's a distance in between us
And I don't exactly know
What it means when you say
That you need some time alone
Are you searching for the answers
To the questions of the heart
When you find them will you tell me
Are we together or apart
(In every minute of every hour)
I'm still thinking of you
(I still love you)
(I want to know are you my friend)
Will you be back again
(I'm here for you)
Ooh
If you need me tonight
(If you need me tonight)
If you need me tonight
(I will be there)
If you need me tonight
(If you need me tonight)
If you need me tonight
(I'll be there)
Please don't get the wrong impression
That I'm waiting to be ruled
Because even though I love you
I'd leave than be a fool
But I'm putting that aside
You know it's you that's on my mind
I know I'll treat you right
If you need me tonight
(In every second of my day)
I'm hoping things will fall my way
(I still love you)
('Coz I have waited here in vain)
I don't wanna feel no pain, no pain
(I'm here for you)
Ooh
If you need me tonight
(If you need me tonight)
If you need me tonight
(I will be there)
If you need me tonight
(If you need me tonight)
If you need me tonight
(I'll be there)
If you need me tonight
Need me tonight
Need me tonight
Alright
If you need me
If you want me
Come on now

I feel like I'm hanging
Like I'm a puppet on a string
Ting-a-ling-a-ling-ling
Which way am I turning?
So bu ba da back make me kick my rap
'Coz I'm kicking it, kicking it bad
When I'm rapping on a vocal track
Do you know how I'm feeling
I never really knew
It was my heart you were stealing
So why put up a fight?
If you know very well that you need me tonight

Need me, need me
(If you need me tonight)
If you need me tonight
If you need me tonight
(If you need me tonight)
If you
Need me
Want me
Need me
Want me
Be here
I'll be here for you
I still love you, want you
I don't know how
I don't know how I feel for you
