So many ways I want to tell you, the way I feel for you
Night and day I’m thinking of you, because my aim is true
Lost inside the rhythm, crazy for the love of you
It’s all I ever wanted. Babe you’ve got to know it’s true
I couldn’t love you more, I couldn’t love you more
I couldn’t love you more, baby I couldn’t love you more
Can’t contemplate a life without you, without the things you do
Every day my heart sings for you, for life‘s a dream come true
I found a road to freedom, all because the love of you
It’s all I ever wanted, baby you’ve got to know it’s true
I couldn’t love you more, I couldn’t love you more
I couldn’t love you more, I couldn’t love you more
From the beginning it was plain for me to see
You were the one, the one for me
It would have hurt so much if it was not to be
You were the one, the only one
I couldn’t love you more, I couldn’t love you more
I couldn’t love you more, couldn’t love you more
So many ways, all of my dreams, babe I want to tell you
Night and day, day and night, I couldn’t love you more
