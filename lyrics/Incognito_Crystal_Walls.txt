Crystal walls they cannot hide
The secrets of your crystal well
I can see right through you now
As I navigate your crystal maze

I’m not gonna try and stop you
And you runnin’ , runnin’, runnin’
With your head
Nothing that I see
Who’s gonna be
I know what’s runnin’, runnin, runnin’
Through your mind
I can’t understand why you try to shut me out
I’ve always been  you
I can’t count the days
Before you turn bow
I won’t be there on your

Crystal walls they cannot hide
The secrets of your crystal well
I can see right through you now
Yeah as I navigate your crystal maze
Yeah yes ahh

I’m not gonna try to change you
And  you, runnin’, runnin’
With your head
Best  and do the
I know what’s runnin, runnin’
Through your mind
Let me ever say
Before you walk away
I wanna spend my one
Oh say to you
 at the games you always played
Not be the one that you want to

I can’t understand why you try to shut me out
‘Cause I’ve always been  you
Ahh baby
I can’t count the days (I can’t count the days)
Before you turn bow
‘Cause I know I'll be the one you want to
Yes, I know I'll be the one you want to
