You taught me how to do
All the things, now you seem to be a part of me
I know it's just part of the game
To go back and start again, still it ain't so easy, it's inside me
When, when you're ready to
I'll come up to you, I'll take you for a walk with me
To a place that's not real
Where we can heal, all the things inside you and me
All the things inside you and me
It's hard to tell where this road will go
No matter what they say, don't look below
It's hard to tell where this road will go
No matter what they say, don't look below
It's hard to tell where this road will go
No matter what they say, don't look below
What's going on? I don't know what is right or wrong
What's going on? I don't know what is right or wrong
What's going on? I don't know what is right or wrong
(It's hard to tell where this road will go)
What's going on? (No matter what they say, don't look below)
Don't look below, look below, don't look below
