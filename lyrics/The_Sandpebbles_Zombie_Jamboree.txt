It was a zombie jamboree
Took place in the New York cemetery
Oh, it was a zombie jamboree
Took place in the New York cemetery
Zombies from all parts of the island
Some of them are great Calypsonians
Since the season was carnival
They got together in bacchanal
And they were singing:
Chorus
Back to back, mon, belly to belly
I don't give a damn 'cause I'm stone dead already
Oh, back to back, belly to belly
It's a zombie jamboree
One female zombie she won't behave
See how's she's dancing out of the grave
In one hand she's holding a quart of rum
The other hand is knocking a conga drum
You know the lead singer starts to make his rhyme
While the other zombie is rockin' in time
One bystander, he had this to say:
"It was a trip to see the zombies break away."
SHAH! And they were singing:
(Repeat chorus twice)
Oh wwooooo a zombie jamborie
Its getting very hard for me to see
I can not find my eyeball anywhere
Oh wwooooooo yeah yeah
There's a high-wire zombie 'tween the World Trades
A King Kong zombie on the Empire State
But the biggest zombies Tokyo to Rome
The zombies who call the city home
(Hah! What they do! Huh!)
(Repeat chorus to fade)
