Walk around, why wear a frown?
Say little people try to put you down
What you need is a helping hand
All the strength at your command
How's your faith? 'Cause your faith is you
Who you kiddin'? To yourself be true
Spread your love for a brighter day
For what you search, you'll find a way

Ah, yes, sir, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ah, yes, sir, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

We are people of the mighty (Mighty)
Mighty people of the sun (Of the sun)
In our hearts lies all the answers (All the answers)
To the truth you can't run from
(You can do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it)

Eagles fly every seven days
Still cryin' the blues, all about your pay
What you gonna do 'bout your living thang?
Will you make it better or you just complain?
Every day is real, don't run from fear
'Cause better days are very near
There are times when you're bound to cry
One more time, head to the sky

Ah, yes, sir, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ah, yes, sir, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

We are people of the mighty
Mighty people of the sun
In our heart lies all the answers
To the truth you can't run from
(You can do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it)
We are people of the mighty
Mighty people of the sun
In our heart lies all the answers
To the truth you can't run from
(You can do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it)
We are people of the mighty
Mighty people of the sun
(You can do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it)
In our heart lies all the answers
To the truth you can't run from
(You can do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it)
