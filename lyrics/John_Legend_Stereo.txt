Ya-ya, ya-ya
Ya-ya

She's a fast love professional
Crafty, bold and beautiful
Staged right, locked eyes
I swear it's magical
Her name is Melanie
Says she digs my melodies
Likes how I move, thinks I'm cool
That's what she says to me

Big stage, bright lights
Short love, long nights
Frequent flights through the skies
To see stars
I come back to town
She's hangin' around
It still feels so real
But it can't go too far

Her favorite colours be platinum and gold
She only loves in stereo, she only loves in stereo
I should know, 'cause I've seen it before
I think I gotta let her go, she only loves in stereo

Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh

Turned on the video
Oh, my goodness, there she goes
Now I'm hot, seems I'm not
The only one she knows
Name droppin' everyday
But I still want her anyway
I like how she moves, think she's cool
My favorite getaway

Big stage, bright lights
Short love, long nights
Deja vu, yeah, we do
It again
Off to the next town
She's on to the next round
Let it go, we both know
That it's all gonna end, oh

Her favorite colours be platinum and gold
She only loves in stereo, she only loves in stereo
I should know 'cause I've seen it before
I think I gotta let her go, she only loves in stereo

Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh

She fell in love with the radio
It wasn't really me
So I had to let her go
Just ask any DJ back in her hometown
She likes to get around
Just watch as she gets down, oh

Her favorite colours be platinum and gold
She only loves in stereo, she only loves in stereo
I should know 'cause I've seen it before
I think I gotta let her go, she only loves in stereo

Oh-oh, oh-oh
She loves in stereo (I think I gotta let her go)
Oh-oh, oh-oh (Oh)
She loves in stereo (I think I gotta let her go)
Oh-oh (Oh-oh), oh-oh (Oh-oh)
She loves in stereo (Yeah-yeah)
Oh-oh, oh-oh (She loves in stereo)
She loves in stereo, oh
Oh-oh, oh, oh
