So right, so right, so right
Do-do, do-do, do-do
Yeah, yeah
Huh!
She said she loves me
She said she loves me
Life is now a brand new game
I want to play
Never will I be the same
And that’s okay
(Hey, girl, you’ve got me)
Girl, you’ve got me walking proud, I’m so high
(Higher than a tree)
I feel like I’m on a cloud, and I can fly
She said she loves me
(All through the night)
She said she loves me, and it was
(So right) Well (So right, so right)
You know, she said she loves me
(All through the night)
She said she loves me
(So right, so right, so right)
Over are the games I played
I found the one
My love for you will never fade
The search is done
(Happiness, I see) Happiness is all I see
(Yes indeed, yes indeed) I know you care
(My necessity) You are my necessity
And this I swear
She said she loves me
(All through the night)
She said she loves me, and it was
(So right) Yeah (So right, so right)
You know, she said she loves me
She said she loves me
(Yes indeed, yes indeed)
She said she loves me
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Yes indeed, yes indeed
Ooh, she said she loves me
(Yes indeed, yes indeed)
She said she loves me
(So right, so right) Well (So right)
She said she loves me
(Yes indeed, yes indeed)
She said she loves me
(So right, so right, so right)
And I want everybody to know
That I love this little girl so
She said she loves me
She said she loves me
She said she loves me
And I truly believe
That her love, that her love
I could climb a mountain
I could swim the deep sea
I can do anything and everything
As long as she’s loving me
As long as she’s loving me
As long as she’s loving me
She said she loves me
She said she loves me
She said she loves me
