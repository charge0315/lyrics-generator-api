Help me, I'm falling down
Help me, I'm falling down the stair
Of my thoughts, my heart
Help, I'm slipping down
Help me
I'm slipping down, I feel my skin dry
Miles away they could be rebirth
They could become a cloud
They could be anyhow
Just a small portion of the ocean, so...
Give me something softer cautionly (?)
Give me some feathers so that I can stop it and glide
And glide up
Like a little birds and glide up
Like an eagle
With gigantic wings
Master the winds of change
Master the winds
Reborn again
Like a phoenix
So help me
Help me, I'm gonna fly
Help me
Help me, I'm gonna fly so high
Like a phoenix
Born again like a phoenix
Born again like a phoenix
Born again
