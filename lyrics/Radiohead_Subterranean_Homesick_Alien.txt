The breath of the morning, I keep forgettin'
The smell of the warm summer air
I live in a town where you can't smell a thing
You watch your feet for cracks in the pavement

And up above, aliens hover
Makin' home movies for the folks back home
Of all these weird creatures who lock up their spirits
Drill holes in 'emselves, and live for their secrets

They're all uptight, uptight
Uptight, uptight
Uptight, uptight
Up

I wish that they'd swoop down in a country lane
Late at night when I'm drivin'
Take me onboard their beautiful ship
Show me the world as I'd love to see it

I'd tell all my friends, but they'd never believe me
They'd think that I'd finally lost it completely
I'd show them the stars and the meaning of life
They'd shut me away, but I'd be alright
Alright, I'm alright, alright

I'm just uptight, uptight
Uptight, uptight
Uptight, uptight
Uptight, uptight
Uptight
