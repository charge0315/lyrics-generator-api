Love is gonna, love is gonna... (love)
Love is gonna, love is gonna... (love)
Love is gonna, love is gonna...
Love is gonna, love is gonna...
Love is gonna, love is gonna... (mm, love)
Love is gonna, love is gonna...
Love is gonna, love is gonna...
Love is gonna, love is gonna...

I used to make fun of other guys in love
Their heads were in a cloud, and all they thought of
Was her, never, no-no, not me
They tried to tell me how good love made them feel
I told them that they were not being for real
No sir, no one could make me see

They're telling me love will come, love will be there
You can run, doesn't matter what they're telling me

(Love is gonna sneak up on ya) and...
(Take your heart away, take your heart away)
Telling me that love...
(Love is gonna sneak up on ya) and...
(Take your heart away, take your heart away)
(Take your heart away)
(Love is gonna sneak up on ya) and...
(Take your heart away, take your heart away)
Baby, baby, (love is gonna sneak up on you)
(Take your heart away, take your heart away)

(Dig) you were so different, you were not like the rest
And in retrospect, I know I'm truly blessed
Oh-oh, happy beyond belief, he-hey, hey hey
I talk about you to my friends all the time
They ask if anything, they fear for my mind
Oh no, I'm your Adam and you're my Eve

I'm telling you love will come, love will be there
You can run, doesn't matter what I'm telling you

(Love is gonna sneak up on ya) and...
(Take your heart away, take your heart away)
Telling you that love...
(Love is gonna sneak up on ya) and...
(Take your heart away, take your heart away)
(Take your heart away)
I'm tellin' you love is gonna sneak up
(Love is gonna sneak up on ya) and...
(Take your heart away, take your heart away)
Oh, girl (love is gonna sneak up on you) and
(Take your heart away, take your heart away)

I never thought in my widest dreams
Walking in the rain could be so beautiful
Those feelings I thought
Now seems to be all that I'm livin' for, oh baby

I talk about you to my friends all the time
They ask if anything, they fear for my mind
Oh no, I'm your Adam and you're my Eve

And I'm telling you love will come, love will be there
You can run, doesn't matter what I'm telling you

(Love is gonna sneak up on ya)
(Take your heart away, take your heart away)
Telling you that love...
(Love is gonna sneak up on ya) sneak up on ya
(Take your heart away, take your heart away)
(Take your heart away) I'm telling you
(Love is gonna sneak up on ya) and...
(Take your heart away, take your heart away)
Oh, baby (love is gonna sneak up on you) one day
(Take your heart away, take your heart away)
(Take your heart away)

(Love is gonna sneak up on ya) love is gonna sneak up on ya
And... (take your heart away)
Love is gonna sneak up on ya (take your heart away)
(Love is gonna sneak up on ya) love is gonna sneak up on ya
And... (take your heart away, take your heart away)
(Take your heart away)
(Love is gonna sneak up on ya) love is gonna...
(Take your heart away, take your heart away) love is gonna...
(Love is gonna sneak up on you)
(Take your heart away, take your heart away)
(Take your heart away)
Baby, baby, baby (love is gonna sneak up on ya)
Oh baby, oh baby (take your heart away, take your heart away)
Baby, baby, baby, baby (love is gonna sneak up on ya)
And make you happy (take your heart away, take your heart away)
(Take your heart away...)
