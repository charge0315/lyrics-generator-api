(Never, never, never gonna hurt you, girl)
You made a promise
(Never, never, never gonna hurt you, girl)
And you broke it
(Never, never, never gonna hurt you, girl)
He could never love you like I do
(Never, never, never gonna hurt you, girl)
Ooh, I feel so bad

Hurt, to think that you lied to me
Hurt, way down deep inside of me
You said your love was true and we'd never part
Now you've found someone new
And it breaks my heart
I'm hurt

Hurt, much more than you'll ever know
Hurt, because I still love you so
(But even though you hurt me)
Like no-one else could do
I would never, never hurt you

Even though you've taken your love from me
Baby, I want you back (Never, never, never gonna hurt you, girl)
I'll never hurt you (Never hurt)

I'll never hurt you (Never, never, never gonna hurt you, girl)
(Never hurt)
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no (Never, never, never gonna hurt you, girl)
(Never hurt)
I'll never hurt you (Never, never, never gonna hurt you, girl)
(Never hurt)
I'll never hurt you (Never, never, never gonna hurt you, girl)
(Never hurt)
(Never, never, never gonna hurt you, girl)
(Never hurt)
No, no, no, no, no (Never, never, never gonna hurt you, girl)
I'm never gonna hurt you (Never hurt)
