I don't believe what I'm hearing
You can't impress me by words you show me
Don't think I'm going through changes
Boy, you might see me change for the last time

Having a bad day, better deal with it
If you're playing games, no time for it
If you're bringing pain, gonna run from it
Don't mess up my day

I'm the only one who's responsible
For me having fun and you can't take my (Here we go)

Happiness
Is what my life's about
Happiness
No, I can't do without
Happiness
Nothing can stop me now
Through ups and downs
I'm still happy

Life is as good as I make it
I can't sit around while you make it for me
I like those jewels that you gave me
But I wanna buy some jewels for myself

To lose the ball and chain, gotta reach for it
To realize my dreams, gotta reach for it
Nothing comes for free, gotta reach for it
I'm not gonna have to depend on you

I'm the only one who's responsible
For me having fun and you can't take my (Here we go)

Happiness
Is what my life's about
Happiness
No, I can't do without
Happiness
Nothing can stop me now
Through ups and downs
I'm still happy

I'm the only one who's responsible
For me having fun and you can't take my (Oh, no)

Happiness
Is what my life's about
Happiness
No, I can't do without
Happiness
Nothing can stop me now
Through ups and downs
I'm still happy
Happiness
Is what my life's about
Happiness
No, I can't do without
Happiness
Nothing can stop me now
Through ups and downs
I'm still happy

Happiness
