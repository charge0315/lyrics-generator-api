Love is the answer to my prayer
Don't you ever leave me
I swear that you are the answer to my prayer

I prayed for a lot of things to come my way
You came and you brightened up my darkest days
You are the one that I've been waiting for
I cross my heart, my love for you is pure

'Cause love is the answer to my prayer
Don't you ever leave me
I swear that you are the answer to my prayer

I was such a lonely guy, always alone (Always alone)
Problems were my only friend, but now they're gone (But now they're gone)
I never knew that love could be so grand
You changed my life, now I'm a happy man

'Cause love is the answer to my prayer
Don't you ever leave me
I swear that you are the answer to my prayer
Love is the answer to my prayer
Don't you ever leave me
I swear that you are the answer to my prayer
Don't you ever leave me
I swear that love is the answer to my prayer
I swear that you are the answer to my prayer
Don't ever leave me
I swear that love is the answer to my prayer
I swear that you are the answer to my prayer
I tell you, I tell you
I swear ...
