Now I can see how much you mean to me, you keep in my heart each time
A picture painted clear, where we will go from here
You slip through the night, down from the mountain light
You stand at my door, but I'm gone to my ship, my easy chair
Suddenly you are there, I see you
Midnight angel, you're more than just a dream
Midnight angel, angel, I love you, yeah I love you
Midnight angel, angel
Where is my flame to welcome me home again
Here and then gone away, she knows I really care
Suddenly she is there just for me
Midnight angel, you're more than just a dream
Midnight angel, angel, I love you, yeah I love you
Midnight angel, angel
Midnight angel, you're more than just a dream to me
Midnight angel, angel, I love you, ooh I love you
Oh angel, angel, I love you, ooh I love you
Midnight angel, sweet angel
Midnight angel
