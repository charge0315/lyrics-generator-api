Mercury's in retrograde
Don't believe a thing I say
You know I don't believe that stuff
My mind's only made of dust
The echo always said get real
Mostly I just go by feel
Kick it first if it don't start
Don't need tools, I got my heart

Are we free or afraid of what we're told?
Are we out of or under control?

When Saturn returns I begin
To trust in patterns more than men
Or the stories that they tell
Even when they tell them well
The echo always sounded good
Until I finally understood
I only had to open the door
Now I don't trust the echo anymore

Are we free or afraid of what we're told?
Are we out of or under control?

All these planets pulling me around
They pulled my face into a frown
Even though my mind's made up
My mind's only made of dust
From stars and clouds and oceans all unseen
From stars and clouds and oceans all unseen

Are we free or afraid of what we're told?
Are we out of or under control?
