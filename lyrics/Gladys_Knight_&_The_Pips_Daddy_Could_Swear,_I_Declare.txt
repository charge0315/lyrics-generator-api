Oh, oh, yeah
Ooh my mercy

Ooh, how I remember daddy
He was strong and had a built in tan, yeah
And though he only stood about five feet seven
My daddy was a heck of a man, yes he was, y'all
He loved us all and we knew it, yeah
Though he showed it in a very funny way
For most of the time he was a-cussin' and fussin'
When he said what he had to say
Now, now, now

Daddy couldn't read
Daddy couldn't write
But one thing daddy sure could do right

He could swear
Oh, Lord, I declare
Yes, he could, y'all
Daddy could swear
I declare, oh mercy

I still remember seein' him in the backyard
Just a-pickin' and a-paintin' away (Woo, woo, woo, woo)
Ooh, my brothers and sisters
Still talk about how
Daddy lost his temper that day (Woo, woo, woo, woo)
You see, he built a picket fence
From the garage to the house
Well, tell me what I say
The same day the garbage man
Backed into the fence
And the whole darn thing gave way
You should have been there

Daddy couldn't read (Ooh my, mercy)
Daddy couldn't write (Ooh my, mercy)
One thing daddy sure could do right

He could swear
Oh, Lord, I declare
Yes, he could, y'all
Daddy could swear
Oh, Lord, I declare
Yes, he could, y'all

Tell 'em about
Tell about your daddy
My daddy was a
"What you say? Watch your mouth"
My daddy was a
"What you say? Watch your mouth"
My daddy was a
"What you say? Watch your mouth
Ooh, no

My, my, my, my, my daddy wasn't no scholar, no
No, he didn't have a PhD (Woo, woo, woo, woo)
Hah, but in my eyes and down in my heart
My daddy means the world to me (Woo, woo, woo, woo)
He'll probably go out (Talkin' about daddy)
Cursin', just a-fussin'
And a-bein' mad
But I hope the Good Lord will understand ('Bout my dad)
That my daddy's is just bein' my dad
Now, now, now, now

Daddy couldn't read
Daddy couldn't write
But one thing daddy sure could do right

He could swear
Oh, Lord, I declare
Ooh y'all, yes he could
He could swear (I declare)
I declare, ooh my mercy

Mercy, that's my daddy (I declare, that's my daddy)
He could swear y'all (He could swear)
Talkin' 'bout daddy (Talkin' 'bout daddy)
I declare y'all (I declare)
That's my daddy (That;s my dad)
Ooh lord (He could swear)
Talking 'bout daddy (Talking bout daddy)
I declare y'all (I declare)
That's my daddy (That's my dad)
He could swear y'all (He could swear)
Talking about daddy (Talkin' about daddy)
