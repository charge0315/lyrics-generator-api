Mother, mother, tell your children
That their time has just begun
I have suffered for my anger
There are wars that can't be won

Father, father, please believe me
I am layin' down my guns
I am broken like an arrow
Forgive me
Forgive your wayward son

(Everybody needs somebody to love)
Mother, mother (Everybody needs somebody to hate)
Please believe me (Everybody's bitchin' 'cause they can't get enough)
And it's hard to hold on when there's no one to lean on

(Faith) You know you're gonna live through the rain
Lord, we've gotta keep the faith
(Faith) Don't you let your love turn to hate
Now we've gotta keep the faith

Keep the faith
Keep the faith
Lord, we've gotta keep the faith

Tell me, baby, when I hurt you
Do you keep it all inside?
Do you tell me all's forgiven
Just hide behind your pride?
Yeah

(Everybody needs somebody to love)
Mother, father (Everybody needs somebody to hate)
Please don't leave me
(Everybody's bleedin' 'cause the times are tough)
Well, it's hard to be strong when there's no one to dream on

(Faith) You know you're gonna live through the rain
Lord, we've gotta keep the faith
(Faith) Don't you know it's never too late?
Right now we've gotta keep the faith
(Faith) Don't you let your love turn to hate
Lord, we've gotta keep the faith

Keep the faith
Keep the faith
Oh, we've gotta keep the faith
Keep the faith
Keep the faith
Lord, we gotta keep the faith

Ooh yeah, ooh yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah

I've been walkin' in the footsteps
Of society's lies
I don't like what I see no more
Sometimes I wish that I was blind
Sometimes I wait forever
To stand out in the rain
So no one sees me cryin'
Tryna wash away this pain

Mother, father (Everybody needs somebody to love)
There's things I've done I can't erase
(Everybody needs somebody to hate) And every night we fall from grace
(Everybody's bitchin' 'cause they can't get enough) It's hard with the world in your face
(Everybody bleeds, everybody, keep the faith) Tryna hold on, tryna hold on

(Faith) You know you're gonna live through the rain
Lord, you gotta keep the faith
(Faith) Don't you let your love turn to hate
Right now, we've gotta keep the faith
(Faith) Keep the faith, keep the faith (Tryna hold on, tryna hold on, yeah)
(Faith) (Ow!) Keep the faith, keep the faith
Everybody, keep the faith
(Faith) Keep the faith, keep the faith (Ooh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Everybody needs somebody to love (Faith)
(Ooh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah) Everybody needs somebody to hate
Everybody needs somebody to love (Faith)
(Oh, na-na, oh na-na)
Everybody bleeds, everybody, keep the faith (Oh!)
(Faith)
(Faith)
(Faith)
