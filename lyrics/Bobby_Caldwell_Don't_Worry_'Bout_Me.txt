Don't worry 'bout me
I'll get along
Forget about me
Be happy my love
Just say our little show
Is over and so
The story ends
Why not call it a day
The sensible way
And still be friends
Look out for your self
Should always be the rule
Give your heart and your love
To whomever you love
Don't you be a fool
Baby why stop to cling
To some fading thing
That used to be
If you can forget
Don't you worry 'bout me
Baby why stop and cling
To some fading thing
That used to be
If you can forget
Don't you worry 'bout me
