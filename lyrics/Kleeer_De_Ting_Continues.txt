In our last episode, we were kleeerly feeling the funk...
And now, de ting continues
I'm the Wood, I know I'm good
And I'm givin' up the beat
I said, beba boba baby, I don't mean maybe
Wanna make you move your feet
Hey, off the wall, and call me Paul
Little momma, let me ring your bell
Gonna make you move, gonna make you groove
And never gonna kiss and tell
Yeah, Rick, sugar slick, pass any test
Strokin' my guitar, and ladies are
The things that I do best
My name is Norm, and when I perform
I like to get down to the dollar
If you want thе funk, and not a lot of junk
Let me hear еverybody holler! (yay!)
It's me, the Wiz, my function is
To ease down to the bottom
I'm Terry Tough, I don't take no stuff
Anything you want, I've got 'em
Last and not least, we're from the East
And we're gonna sing a while
We are Kleeer beauty, and that's our duty
Don't want to change your style
This is general Boregard Stonseee here
And if you wanna be in my army, recite this:
"I kleeerly, reeeally feel the funk!
