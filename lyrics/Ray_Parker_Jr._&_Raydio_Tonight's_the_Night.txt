I'm a lonely man with a lot of love
Building up inside that I try to hide
Waitin' for that special girl someday
I need a woman who will understand
What my needs are and wants are
Someone to take my fantasies away
So if you're the girl (You're the girl)
That I'm looking for
Won't you show me (Show me)
Show me tonight?
'Cause when you look at me and I look at you
I feel the magic is right (The magic is right)
Come on, baby
The mood is right
Ooh, ooh, come on, sugar
Tonight's the night
Come on, baby
The mood is right
Ooh, ooh, come on, sugar
I believe tonight's the night
Just a lonely man in a desperate search
For a woman with potential
Of becoming more than just a friend
Honey, if you wish to establish
A long-lasting relationship
It's gonna take us more than just one night
So I understand (Understand)
Go on and take your time (Time)
To decide when it's right, oh baby
And when I'm close to you and you're close to me
I get the feeling tonight's the night (Tonight's the night)
Ow
Come on, baby
The mood is right
Oh yeah, come on, sugar
Tonight's the night
Come on, baby
The mood is right
Ooh, ooh, come on, sugar
Tonight's the night
Come on, baby
The mood is right
Ooh, ooh, come on, sugar
If you wanna get down, tonight's the night
Come on, baby
The mood is right
Oh yeah, come on, sugar
Tonight's the night
So tell Thomas Edison we don't want his lights
And remind Mister Bell not to ring this phone tonight
Come on, baby
The mood is right
Ooh, ooh, come on, sugar
If you wanna get down, tonight's the night, ow
