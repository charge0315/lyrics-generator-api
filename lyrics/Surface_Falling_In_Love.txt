Falling in love with you
I’ve got this feeling, baby
That my face won’t hide
Thinking about the day we met
Oh, warms me up inside
I feel so good, honey
Since you came in my life
You make me feel so special
When I’m by your side
I’m falling in love
Falling in love with you (falling in love)
I’m falling in love
Falling in love with you
And with every touch
I’ve got my mind made up (oh, mind made up)
I found the man of my dreams
It could only happen once
Falling in love (oh)
Falling in love with you (oh, yeah)
I’m falling in love
Falling in love with you (you’re my love)
No question, baby
It’s so plain to see
You are the one
You’re the one for me
I’m spinning around
My head’s in the sky
And I know the reason
Know the reason why
Falling in love
Falling in love with you (falling in love)
I’m falling in love
Falling in love with you
And with every touch
I’ve got my my mind made up (oh, mind made up)
I’ve found the man of my dreams
It could only happen once
(No)
Falling in love (in love, yeah)
Falling in love with you (falling in love)
Falling in love (falling in love with you)
Falling in love with you (you’re my love)
