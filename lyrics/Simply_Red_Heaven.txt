Everybody's trying to get to the bar
The name of the bar
The bar is called Heaven
Now the band in Heaven
They play my favourite song
They play it once again
They play it all night long

Heaven
Heaven is a place
A place where nothing
Nothing ever happens

There is a party, everybody will be there
Everyone will leave at exactly the same time
It's hard to imagine that nothing at all
Could be so exciting, could be so much fun

Heaven
Heaven is a place
A place where nothing
Nothing ever happens

Now when this kiss is over
We'll start all over again
We'll not be any different, we'll be exactly the same
It's hard to imagine that nothing at all
Could be so exciting, could be so much fun

Heaven
Heaven is a place
A place where nothing
Nothing ever happens
