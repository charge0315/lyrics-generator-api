Don't know no history
Except for your own, your own
That lipstick on your teeth
Don't bother you none, no, none

'Cause there's somethin' 'bout how raw you are, it's kinda beautiful and makes you feel ali-ive (I-I, I-I-I-I)
It's so much more the way you walk, yeah, the way you talk, you got me hypnoti-ized (I-I, I-I-I)

I like you unsweet
Don't need no manners
Don't need the good, the good grammar when you pour your heart out on me
Heart on me, when you pour your heart on me
I want you unsweet
You satisfy me
That brutal honesty, won't you pour your heart out on me?
Heart on me, when you pour your heart on me

I'm not your enemy
I ain't changin' you none (I-I, I-I-I-I)
Those girls are stickly sweet (Sweet)
Leave a burn on my tongue (I-I–, oh, yeah–I-I-I-I)

Heart on me, when you pour your heart on me
I want you unsweet
You satisfy me
That brutal honesty, won't you pour your heart out on me?
Heart on me, when you pour your heart on me

When you pour it up, I don't need a cup
Don't you clean it up, I don't mind gettin' messy with your love
When you pour it up, I don't need a cup
Don't you clean it up, I don't mind gettin' messy with your, messy with your love

I like you unsweet (I like you unsweet)
Don't need no manners (Don't need no manners)
Don't need the good, the good grammar when you pour your heart out on me (Oh, when you pour your heart)
Heart on me (When you pour your heart), when you pour your heart on me

Heart on me, when you pour your heart on me
