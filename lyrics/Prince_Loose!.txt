Hey whoop it up y'all
1-2-3-4
1-2-3-4! 1-2-3-4

(Loose!) Everybody wants to know what's wrong with you
(Loose!) They see you actin' like a crazy fool
(Loose!) When the music hits you don't know what to do

Push your way up to the front
And shake your motherfucking 'do loose
(Loose)
Fucking 'do Loose! (Loose)

(Loose!) Banging gangs, slanging wangs and rock
(Loose!) Won't gain you nothing but an angry cop
(Loose!) Get your education first, then buy a pair of shoes

Push your way up to the front
And shake your motherfucking 'do loose
Guitar solo

(Loose!) How the hell you gonna tell me what to do?
(Loose!) I got the clothes, I got the bank and the crew
(Loose!) And if you look real close, I even got your garden tool

Push your way up to the front
And shake your motherfucking 'do loose
(Loose)
C'mon everybody, loose
Turn around
Guitar solo (loose)
(Loose)
(Loose)
(Loose)
Turn around again
Turn around again
On the one (loose)

Cool
