I hear the clock on the wall, here comes the night
We got all the love in control, to make it right
With you, baby, bless your soul
You know you keep a man from getting old

Baby, it's you
Baby, it's you
You, baby

I breathe the air, sweet perfume
We see the moon, misty shadows mold your body in the room
All through the years, far as I can see
It's me loving you and you loving me

Baby, it's you
Baby, it's you
You, baby

All in your arms is a wonderful thing
A natural sensation as my body sing
We're two groovy people, baby, you don't know
Dancin' to the music, movin' to and fro
Just layin' my face all upon your breast
Floats me above the world and I must confess

Baby, it's you, you, you
Baby, it's you

This magic hour, like a flower, blossoming now
Like a birth of love unexplained, happening now
Feel me tremble as we reach our goal
You hold me so tight, keep me in control

Baby, it's you, you, you
Baby, it's you, you, you
Baby, it's you, you, you
Baby, it's you, you, you
Baby, it's you, you, you
You (You), you (You), you (You)
Baby, it's you, you, you
Baby, it's you, you, you
Baby, it's you, you, you

All through the years, far as I can see
Is me loving you and you loving me
Feel me tremble as we reach our goal
You know you keep a man from getting old

Baby, it's you, you, you
Baby, it's you, you, you
Baby, it's you, you, you
You (You), you (You), you (You)
Baby, it's you, you, you
You, baby
Baby, it's you, you, you
You, you, you
Baby, it's you, you, you
Baby, it's you, you, you
Baby, it's you, you, you
You, you, you, you, you, you
Baby, it's you, you, you
Baby, it's you, you, you
You, you, you, you, you
You, you, you, you, you
Baby, it's you, you, you
You, you, you
Baby, it's you, you, you
You, baby
Baby, it's you
