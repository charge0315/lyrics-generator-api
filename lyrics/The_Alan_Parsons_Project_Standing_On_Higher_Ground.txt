I know the truth
But I can't say
And I have to turn my head
And look the other way
I'm not afraid
And I won't lie
As long as I see no wrong
I won't need to testify

I see the world
And I'm looking from a high place
Way above it all
Standing on higher ground
I breathe the air
While they're running in a rat race
Way above it all
Standing on higher ground

I feel the blow
But I don't speak
And I have to close my eyes
Pretending I'm asleep
Well, I see the tears
But I don't cry
As long as I do no wrong
I don't need an alibi

I see the world
And I'm looking from a high place
Way above it all
Standing on higher ground
I breathe the air
While they're running in a rat race
Way above it all
Standing on higher ground

Way above it all
Way above it all
Down on the world
Standing on higher ground
Way above it all
Way above it all
Down on the world
Standing on higher ground

I see the world (I see the world)
And I'm looking from a high place (Looking from a high place)
Way above it all (Way above it)
Standing on higher ground
Way above it all
I breathe the air (I breathe the air)
While they're running in a rat race (Running in a rat race)
Way above it all (Way above it)
Standing on higher ground
Way above it all
I see the world (I see the world)
And I'm looking from a high place (Looking from a high place)
Way above it all (Way above it)
Standing on higher ground
Way above it all
I breathe the air (I breathe the air)
While they're running in a rat race (Running in a rat race)
Way above it all (Way above it)
Standing on higher ground
Way above it all (Standing on higher ground)
I see the world (I see the world)
And I'm looking from a high place (Looking from a high place)
Way above it all (Way above it)
Standing on higher ground
Way above it all
I breathe the air (I breathe the air) (Way above it all)
While they're running in a rat race (Running in a rat race) (Way above it all)
Way above it all (Way above it)
Standing on higher ground
Way above it all
I see the world (I see the world) (Way above it all)
And I'm looking from a high place (Looking from a high place) (Way above it all)
Way above it all (Way above it)
Standing on higher ground
Way above it all
I breathe the air (I breathe the air) (Way above it all)
While they're running in a rat race (Running in a rat race) (Way above it all)
Way above it all (Way above it)
Standing on higher ground
Way above it all
I see the world (I see the world) (Way above it all)
And I'm looking from a high place (Looking from a high place) (Way above it all)
Way above it all (Way above it)
Standing on higher ground
