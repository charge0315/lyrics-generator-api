Hey, baby
I don't like the way you got me feeling lately, oh
They say, baby
I'm feeling like you found someone to replace me, oh

Do you remember, you used to say that you would never walk away?
'Cause I remember the time and the place like it was just yesterday, oh
Baby, you had me gone, gone, gone
But you won't have me, I'm gone, gone, gone
Say no more 'cause I know what you came for
Just wanna play them games, girl

'Cause it's so hard (It's so hard, baby) to be let down (To be let down, baby)
Tell me you won't do this to me (No, no, no)
We've come too far (So far, baby) to give up now (To give up now, baby)
Girl, that's just the way it should be (Girl)
Say it with me, babe
(Hey, baby)
Say it with me
(Please don't take my love away)
Say it with me, babe
(Tell the DJ keep this party going)
Say it with me
(Hooray, hooray)
Say it with me, babe
(Hey, baby)
Say it with me
(Please don't take my love away)
Say it with me, baby
(Tell the DJ keep this party going)
Uh-huh

Hey baby, know you crazy (Crazy)
But you ain't that crazy about me (No, you ain't)
'Cause you think that you can get whatever you want (Want)
So you lie and you try to blame me (Nah)
Say lady (Lady), you're cold
You're poison to me and I know (Ooh!)

Do you remember, you used to say that you would never walk away? (Hey!)
'Cause I remember the time and the place like it was just yesterday, oh
Baby, you had me gone, gone, gone (Gone, gone)
But you won't have me, I'm gone, gone, gone (Gone)
Say no more 'cause I know what you came for (For)
Just wanna play them games, girl (Hey!)

'Cause it's so hard (It's so hard, baby) to be let down (To be let down, baby)
Tell me you won't do this to me (No, no, no)
We've come too far (So far, baby) to give up now (To give up now, baby)
Girl, that's just the way it should be (Girl)
Say it with me, babe
(Hey, baby)
Say it with me
(Please don't take my love away)
Say it with me, babe
(Tell the DJ keep this party going)
Say it with me
(Hooray, hooray)
Say it with me, babe
(Hey, baby)
Say it with me
(Please don't take my love away)
Say it with me, baby
(Tell the DJ keep this party going)
Uh-huh (Ooh, ooh, ooh)

Hey baby, please don't take my love away
Tell the DJ keep this party going, hooray hooray
Hey baby, please don't take my love away
Tell the DJ keep this party rocking, hooray hooray
