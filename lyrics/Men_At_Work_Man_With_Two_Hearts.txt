Like a man who has two hearts
Both of them worlds apart
Both of them play their part, you know
Like a man who has two wives
His life then becomes alibis
Nobody asks him why, you know

Can there be peace
Between the heart and the brain?
No release, always the same
I won't come here again

Like a man who has one hand
Still, he does what he can
Shows he is twice the man you are
Like a man who has no hair
It turns out he doesn't care
His eyes though, they show despair, you know

Are we just beasts
With our burdens of pain
No release, always the same
Cut off my legs
Torture and maim
I'm back here again
(Step this out)

Like a man who has two hearts
One day they fell apart
Both of them played their part, you know

Can there be peace
Between the heart and the brain
No release, to try is in vain
Stories repeat always the same
I won't come here again

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
G-g-go!
Ahh

Like a man who has two hearts
Like a man who has two hearts
Mm-hm-mm, mm-hm-mm, mm-hm-mm
Oh, oh, woah-oh, oh-oh
