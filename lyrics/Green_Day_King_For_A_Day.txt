It started at the age of four
My mother went to the grocery store
Went sneakin' through her bedroom door
To find somethin' in a size four

Sugar and spice and everything nice wasn't made for only girls
GI Joe in panty hose is makin' room for the one and only

King for a day, princess by dawn
King for a day in a leather thong
King for a day, princess by dawn
Just wait 'til all the guys get a load of me

My daddy threw me in therapy
He thinks I'm not a real man
Who put the drag in the drag queen?
Don't knock it until you've tried it

Sugar and spice and everything nice wasn't made for only girls
GI Joe in panty hose is makin' room for the one and only

King for a day, princess by dawn
King for a day in a leather thong
King for a day, princess by dawn
Just wait 'til all the guys get a load of me

Sugar and spice and everything nice wasn't made for only girls
GI Joe in panty hose is makin' room for the one and only

King for a day, princess by dawn
King for a day in a leather thong
King for a day, princess by dawn
King for a day in a leather thong
King for a day, princess by dawn
King for a day in a leather thong
King for a day, princess by dawn
Just wait 'til all the guys
Just wait 'til all the guys
Just wait 'til all the guys get a load of me
