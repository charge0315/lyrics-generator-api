When I woke up with the sunlight
And dreams echoing through my head
And I heard you breathing softly
I remember the things you said
There is no time, there is no place
That you would rather be
Then the good times all the hard times
As long as you're here with me

'Cause I'm the man who holds my ground
I'm the man who sticks around
I'm the man to hold you tight
Cause I'm a man in love with you, with you

When I lay down and the moon is bright
At the end of a working day
I gotta feeling I've been leavin
And I won't let it slip away
'Cause there is no time there is no place
That you would rather be
In the cruel world on a cold night
As long as you're here with me Yeah

I'm the man who holds my ground
I'm the man who sticks around
I'm the man to hold you tight
'Cause I'm a man in love
And I'm the man to make it right
I'm the man you kiss goodnight
I'm the man who won't let you down
'Cause I'm a man in love

'Cause it can't get much better
And all we have is time
As long as we're together
I know it's gonna be alright

'Cause I'm the man who holds my ground
I'm the man who sticks around
I'm the man to hold you tight
'Cause I'm a man in love
And I'm the man to make it right
I'm the man you kiss goodnight
I'm the man who won't let you down
'Cause I'm a man in love with you, with you, with you
Ooh, in love with you
