*Rock me after midnight
I wanna be just like a baby
Rock me after midnight
Tell me a fairytale
That love is not for sale
Look at the lives that I live
I'm hooked and money you give for my love
I'll pay there is no other way
To buy me what ineed to go on
Who knows for how long
*(repeat)
Love is a word I had banned
I mean love like I thought It was meant long ago
Today since you kissed me this way
I know that if I follow you now
L'll find the way out
**(repeat)
Rock me after midnight
Rock me
Rock me after midnight
Rock me
*(repeat twice)
