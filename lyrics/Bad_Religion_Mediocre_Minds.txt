Look around the country, an abundance you'll find of
Mediocre minds
Sift trough the fodder as the sane justice declines because of
Mediocre minds
Shrouded under cover, the most flamboyant guise hides a
Mediocre mind
You got yours but you can never bend mine with your
Mediocre minds

When they cry foul you had better watch out
Because you never know which aptitude they're griping about
Don't act too smart for their stenoscopic ways
You'll be discarded away

Reason's not to be what the privileged define with their
Mediocre minds
So many sighted people act so helplessly blind from their
Mediocre minds

If you want attention then you will be asked to bend
But the surest insurrection is enlightenment
Then you can live outside inharmoniously without friends
An enemy

They wanna keep me locked away
'Cause I've an overactive brain

Leaders, presidents and the nightly news guys cater to
Mediocre minds
Reasons not to be what the privileged define with their
Mediocre minds
You got yours but you can never bend mine with your
Mediocre minds
The only natural thing that I despise are the
Mediocre minds
