So you look to me
To come around and baby, when the chips are down
You tell how she nearly brought me to the ground
Mmm, makes me frown
Hmm, it's not the same (Ooh-ooh)
When you tell me how she scolded you about my name (Ahh, ohh, ooh-ooh)
When you called it in the night, while you played her game (Ooh, ooh, ohh)
Ooh, that gets me down (Ohh, ooh, ooh)

So why do we spend so many night deceivin'
Somebody that we know so we leavin'?
We're so deep in the forest, we can't see the trees (Ya, oh)
So why do spend so many nights deceivin'
Somebody that we know so we leavin'?
We're so deep in the forest, we can't see the trees
It's me for you, it's you for me
It's me for you, it's you for me (You for me)

Would you look at me?
Is this the kind of look from a passin' friend?
Is this the kind of talk from closest kin?
I don't know, but it gets me down
Because it's quite the same
When I'm with him and I hold him when I call your name
I don't think he quite understands, no, not yet
Ooh (Waiting 'round), oh, no-no-no, oh, no-no-no (Woo-hoo)

So why do we spend so many night deceivin' (Woo)
Somebody that we know so we leavin'?
We're so deep in the forest, we can't see the trees (Ya, oh)
Why do spend so many nights deceivin'
Somebody that we know and so we leavin'?
We're so deep in the forest, we can't see the trees
It's me for you, it's you for me
It's me for you, it's you for me

It's me for you, it's you for me (Oh, it's me, you, me)
Me for you, it's you (Me, you)
You for me (Oh)
T's me for you, it's you for me (Me for you, you for me, boy, oh)
Me for you, it's you (Me for you, you for me)
You for me (That's the way it's gonna be, baby, baby)
It's me for you, it's you for me (Ooh-ooh-ooh, we've got to believe in one another)
Me for you, it's you (Oh yeah, oh yeah)
You for me (Oh-oh, oh, baby)
It's me for you, it's you for me (Ooh, mmm, baby, baby, baby-baby-baby)
Me for you, it's you (Oh yeah, oh yeah)
Wish you'd understand that you're my man
Everything will be alright
Oh, oh, ooh
Baby, baby
Believe me, baby, everything will be
Me and you everyday
Woah-ho, woah-ho, baby
