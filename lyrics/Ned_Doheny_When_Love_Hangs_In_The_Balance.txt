You're asleep at the wheel
The road is endless
The rush is all that's real
There's a love on the line
She makes you crazy
But you don't seem to mind
When love hangs in the balance
You can't let it slide, can't let it slide
Though it may be a slim chance
It can't be denied, can't be denied
So you hide what you fear
She's got potential
But she's young in years
You're a fool, don't you see?
She doesn't want you
Why can't you let it be?
When love hangs in the balance
You can't let it slide, can't let it slide
Though it may be a slim chance
Can't be denied, it can't be denied
Waste away
Hold your breath 'til you're blue
Oh, no, you can't undo
What love has done
You're not the one
She belongs to another
When love hangs in the balance
Can't let it slide, can't let it slide
Though it may be a slim chance
Can't be denied, can't be denied
No matter what you say, boy
She's with you all the way, boy
No matter what you say, boy
She's with you all the way, boy
