Your love is a miracle
Much more than a habit to me
Your love is a miracle
Black magic in the first degree
I get by on your sweetness
Got a taste for that kind of
Sugar in my tea
Don't you cut off my supply
There's no substitute for
This burning desire
You've given me
CHORUS:
When I come home at night
Lookin' for something
To make me feel alright
Just to tease me you hold back
Uh, you shouldn't do that
I'll go crazy and do something
You might not like
CHORUS
Baby when I'm out of reach
Never really out of touch
You know you keep me hummin'
So please promise me, wherever I might be
Your love (will) keep me coming through
CHORUS
