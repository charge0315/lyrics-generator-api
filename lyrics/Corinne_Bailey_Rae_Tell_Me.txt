Young one
Eyes wide
The world is yours
Hold tight
Make mistakes
Get it right
There’ll be heartbreaks
And blue skies
Feel it all
Walk tall
Don’t close your eyes
Burn bright
We’re dancing in the dark
Now and then we glimpse the stars

Tell me, do you like it?
Tell me you’re on fire
Tell me that you’re right where you belong
We can make our own rules
Power to the people
Turn it into something you can love

This is for the dreamers
Let’s make our own scene
Let's make our own scene
This is for the dreamers
We’ve got to believe it
We’ve got to believe it

Sometimes
The world seems
Distant
Out of reach
It’s happening
Behind a screen
And we’re outside
Looking in
But we are
The dreamers
The changers
The people
All connected
You and me
All we have is all we need

Tell me, do you like it?
Tell me you’re on fire
Tell me that you’re right where you belong
We can make our own rules
Power to the people
Turn it into something you can love

This is for the dreamers
Let’s make our own scene
Let's make our own scene
This is for the dreamers
We’ve got to believe it
We’ve got to believe it

Oh, the world is yours
So hold on tight
Change your life
Your times!
We can make it what we like
It’s for the dreamers
This is for the dreamers
This is for the dreamers
This is for the dreamers

Tell me, do you like it?
Tell me you’re on fire
Tell me that you’re right where you belong
If you want to change it
Go ahead and change it
Turn it into something you can love

Tell me do you like it?
Tell me you’re on fire
Tell me that you’re right
Where you belong
We can make our own rules
Power to the people
Turn it into something you can love
