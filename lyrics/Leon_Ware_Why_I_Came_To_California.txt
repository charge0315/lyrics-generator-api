Zuma
Oh, I'd like to walk the beach on Zuma
Watching all those pretty girls
Venice
It gets really strange going through Venice
There's a different attitude
On a many summer evening
Found me searching for the fire
The elusive seed of childhood
Then became my one desire
There were places in the valley
Where they said that I could find it
There were rhythms in the distance
In the ancient elder forest
That is why I came to California
It's the strangest groove that I have ever known
All the youth-seekers come to California
Following the fountain in their mind
San Francisco
Catch a cable car to where your dreams go
There's a lot of make-believe
San Diego
From LA, you'll find out where your dreams flow
From the hillside to the desert
Following the map inside me
I can feel the road is leading
To the treasure that will guide me
There were places in the valley
Where they said that I could find it
There were rhythms in the distance
In the ancient elder forest
That is why I came to California
It's the freest groove that I have ever known
All the youth-seekers come to California
Following the fountain in their mind, in their mind
Zuma
Oh, I'd like to walk the beach on Zuma
Watching all those pretty girls
Venice
It gets really strange going through Venice
There's a different attitude
(Searchin' for the fire)
That is why I came to California (California)
It's the purest groove that I have ever known
All the youth-seekers come to California
Following the fountain in their mind
That is why I came to California (California)
It's the strangest groove that I have ever known (California)
All the youth-seekers come to California
Following the fountain in their mind
That is why I came to California
