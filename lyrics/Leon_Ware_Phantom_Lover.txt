Who am I?
You will never know
This woman who makes you stop and go
(Phantom lover)
Close your eye
(Phantom lover)
Set your wild imagination free
All eyes on those passionate arms
To lie with me
(Phantom lover)
Relax
(Phantom lover)
Phantoms are real
You'll learn somethin' you didn't know you could feel
Love no natural woman could forget
Sweet love you'll discover
I'm your phantom lover
(Phantom lover)
Ooh, your phantom lover
(Phantom lover)
And I'll always get to you, oh yeah
(Phantom lover)
And I'll always love you
Your phantom lover
I'll love you all through the night
(Phantom lover)
You'll uncover
(Phantom lover)
All your secret dеsires
(Phantom lover)
In the first ray of еarly morning light
(Phantom lover)
Your phantom lover will be gone
(Phantom lover)
You'll have you carry on
Ooh, the love no natural woman could forget
Sweet love you'll discover
With your phantom lover
I could at least expect me
Ah, there, perfectly right there
Who can say (Who can say)
Where I'll be
I'll get inside you
And make you feel so good
Oh, feel free
(Phantom lover)
I'm your phantom lover
(Phantom lover)
And I'll always get to you
(Phantom lover)
I'm your phantom lover
(Phantom lover)
And I'll always get to you
(Phantom lover)
Ooh ooh
(Phantom lover)
Love, I'm your phantom lover
(Phantom lover)
And I'll always love you
(Phantom lover)
