One for the treble
Two for the bass
Three for the ladies
And four for the blaze
Yo yo yo

It's that heat, that heat, that heat, that heat
It's that heat yo

The heat comin thick down from São Paulo
Bakin' New York shakin' up the Apollo
The rhyme I ignite, people bite and swallow
But the way they recite, it is soundin' real hollow
Hollow like empty 40 ounce bottles
Holla at ya boy if you wanna date models
Brazilian beauties wit booties that wobble
Boobies like tooties that fog up ya goggles
Yeah, I keep it hot, full throttle
Beats bang out to keep ya head on bobble
Instrumentally, I'm rich like lotto
Fundamentally, I just can't follow
Or get sentimental when witnessin' my bros
Divin', duckin', dodgin' from hollow
Point bullets that turn bodies into John Does
I stay positive and rock mics 'cause I go

One for the treble
Two for the bass
Three for the ladies
And Four for the blaze
Slow down, baby
(Hot wind)
That Heat
That Heat
That Heat
It's that Heat
So take off your clothes (get mellow)
Relax your soul (get mellow)
Unwind your spine (get mellow)
(mellow, mellow, mellow)
Slow down, baby

It's that heat, that heat, that heat, that heat
It's that heat, that heat, that heat, that heat
It's that heat, that heat, that heat, that heat
It's that heat yo

It's that heat comin in slow motion
Barbecue ya body, keep ya body straight roastin'
Light skin honeys get the sun tan lotion
Dark skin honeys in the sun with no commotion
You can catch me chillin' by the ocean
With Brazilian feminines sippin' on potions
Girls lookin' like cinammon toast
And I got a little chocolate for ya cinnamon toast
I got the notion to get real close
That's a little self-promotion, don't mind if I boast
Baby, I can be your favorite host
Break you off with a single or freak you double-dose
Just don't catch no emotions
I bring heat from coast to coast and
Beats and rhymes is my devotion
I'm turnin' emcees into ghosts
When I talk about

Po-ta, po-to-da, po-to, da
Heat
(x2)
Bom bom bom
Bom bom bom
One for the treble and
Two for the bass and
Three for the ladies, heat
Four for the ladies, yeah
