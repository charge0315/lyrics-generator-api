He rocks in the treetops all day long
Hoppin' and a-boppin' and singin' his song
All the little birdies on Jaybird Street
Love to hear the robin go tweet, tweet, tweet

Rockin' robin, rock, rock
Rockin' robin
Blow, rockin' robin, 'cause we're really gonna rock tonight

Every little swallow, every chick-a-dee
Every little bird in the tall oak tree
The wise old owl, the big black crow
Flappin' their wings singin', "Go, bird, go"

Rockin' robin, rock, rock
Rockin' robin
Blow, rockin' robin, 'cause we're really gonna rock tonight

Yeah, yeah

Pretty little raven at the bird-band stand
Taught him how to do the bop and it was grand
They started goin' steady and a-bless my soul
He out-bopped the buzzard and the oriole

He rocks in the treetops all day long
Hoppin' and a-boppin' and singin' his song
All the little birdies on Jaybird Street
