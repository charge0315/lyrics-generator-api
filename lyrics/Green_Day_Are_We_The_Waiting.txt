Starry nights, city lights comin' down over me
Skyscrapers, stargazers in my head
Are we? We are
Are we? We are the waiting unknown
This dirty town is burnin' down in my dreams
Lost and found, city-bound in my dreams

And screamin'
Are we? We are
Are we? We are the waiting
And screamin'
Are we? We are
Are we? We are the waiting

Forget-me-nots, second thoughts live in isolation
Heads or tails, fairy tales in my mind
Are we? We are
Are we? We are the waiting unknown
The rage and love, story of my life
The Jesus of Suburbia is a lie

And screamin'
Are we? We are
Are we? We are the waiting
And screamin'
Are we? We are
Are we? We are the waiting unknown
Are we? We are
Are we? We are the waiting
And screamin'
Are we? We are
Are we? We are the waiting unknown
Are we? We are
Are we? We are the waiting unknown
