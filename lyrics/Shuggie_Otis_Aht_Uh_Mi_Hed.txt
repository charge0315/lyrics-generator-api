Aht uh mi hed, it's glowin'
Aht uh mi hed, it's glowin'

Aht uh mi hed, 'cause I heard
Something said in a word
From your voice, did I hear
Only choice, dear?
Aht uh mi hed, je t'aime
From shots that shot above
Aht uh mi hed, things are different
Aht uh mi hed, all the time
In the bed for a rhyme
Flashin' back to your air
And the good there

There magic too
When the spread is on you
Won't you read me a trip
From your whip here? Ooh, oh, no
It's about time for something new
You got to grow, got to grow, yeah
Aht uh mi hed
Aht uh mi hed
Said, head, head, head, glowin'
Oh, I wanna tell you

Head, aht uh mi hed
Aht uh mi hed, aht uh mi hed
Aht uh mi hed (You got the glowin')
Aht uh mi hed, Aht uh mi hed
Uh huh
Oh
