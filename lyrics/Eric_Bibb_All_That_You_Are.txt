All through the years
The things we've been through
The love that we've shared
Has always been true
The mountain's we've climbed
The rivers we've crossed
Whether we won
Or whether we lost
Stand tall, proud an' true
To the faith in my heart
That's what you taught me to do
You didn't have to preach it
Your actions would teach it
With all of my heart
I want to thank you
For all that you are
When I was confused
You showed me the way
I always had you
If I went astray
When I've been right
When I've been wrong
You've always been there
To guide me along
I learnt how to give
How to be true
I learnt how to live
Living with you
