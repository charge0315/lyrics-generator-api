Don't give it up
Don't worry if the sun don't shine
You've seen it before you don't have to worry
Everyday's an uphill climb - nothing has changed
Believe me when i tell ya
Don't give it up - don't give it up...
Don't give up - ya know it's true
Gotta do what you wanna do
Don't give up - you don't have to
Gotta do what you wanna do ,oh yeah
Don't give up - ya know it's true
Gotta do what you wanna do
Don't worry if the sun don't shine
You've seen it before you don't have to worry
Everyday's an uphill climb - nothing has changed
Believe me when i tell ya
Don't give it up ...
Don't give up - ya know it's true
Gotta do what you wanna do
Don't give up - you don't have to
Gotta do what you wanna do, oh yeah
Don't give up - ya know it's true
Gotta do what you wanna do
Yeahhh
