How can you say it's over?
What can there be that we can't overcome?
Why do you turn away
Are you so afraid of needing someone?
Didn't we say forever?
I still believe feeling's strong enough
Before you walk away
Let me hear you say you don't need my love

Stay with me
Darling after all that we've been through
Nobody else can warm your lonely nights
No one's gonna love you like I do
Stay with me
Can't you see we've got too much to lose
Oh, stay with me
Stay with me, baby please

Where is our happy ending
And all of our promises did you forget?
Tell me what's the use in love if it can't last
No I could never let you leave in this way
I want you to stay

Stay with me
Darling after all that we've been through
Nobody else can warm your lonely nights
No one's gonna love you like I do
Stay with me
Can't you see we've got too much to lose
Oh, stay with me
Stay with me
Please

Got to make you stay somehow
Tell me, what's it gonna take?
I can't live without you
So please don't leave me now

Stay with me
Darling after all that we've been through
Nobody else can warm your lonely nights
No one's gonna love you like I do
Stay with me
Can't you see we've got too much to lose
Oh, stay with me
Stay with me, baby please

You've got to stay with me
Stay with me, stay with me
Stay with me
Can't you we've got too much to lose
Stay with me, stay with me
Stay with me, please
Stay with me
