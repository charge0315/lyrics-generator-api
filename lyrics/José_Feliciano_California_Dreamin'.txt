All the leaves are brown, and the sky is gray
I went for a walk on a winter's day
I'd be safe and warm if I was in L.A
Oh, California dreamin'
On such a winter's day, hey

I went into a church, I stopped along the way
Well, I got down on my, on my, on my bended knees
And I began to pray, you know the preacher did succumb
He knows I'm gonna stay, yes, he knows 'cause I told him so
Oh, California dreamin'
On such a winter's day, yeah

Well baby, all the leaves, the leaves
The leaves are brown and the sky is gray
Oh, I went for a walk on a winter's day
I, I, I'd be safe and warm if I was, mira, if I was in L.A
Mmm, yeah, California dreamin'
On such a winter's day, yeah
On such a winter's day, yeah
On such a winter's day, eh-hey
Dream on, California dreamin', dream on

Oye, mira, yo quiero gozar en California
Porque yo me siento tan bien
Y por eso yo te quiero porque tú me tratas bien en California
Mira, no seas tan mala, nena, no me trates así
Que yo me quiero morir, muchachita
Por tu amor, por tu amor, nada más
Oye, no me digas que no, porque yo
Oye, mulata, mira, baby, eh, California dreamin'
It doesn't matter how you say it
All I want to say is I love, I love California, baby, yeah
I really love, I really love
I really need a little bit of lovin', yeah

California dreamin', oh yeah
Calfornia dreamin', California dreamin'
