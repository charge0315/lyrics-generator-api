I feel it by my side
It's been there for a while, now
It could make things better
There's still something out there
That we never talk about
It could make my life easier
Make my life easier
(Chorus)
Will you offer
What I'm after?
Hope you'll do it someday
So we'll never go our separate ways
I don't want to make you cry
Just make you wonder why
You'll have to find the answer
I feel it oh so well
So why is it hard for you to tell?
You'd make my life easier
Make my life easier
(Chorus)
Please find the time
And make a decision
Now is the right time
To answer this question
(Chorus)
So we'll never go our saparate ways
Separate Ways Lyrics
I feel it by my side
It's been there for a while, now
It could make things better
There's still something out there
That we never talk about
It could make my life easier
Make my life easier
(Chorus)
Will you offer
What I'm after?
Hope you'll do it someday
So we'll never go our separate ways
I don't want to make you cry
Just make you wonder why
You'll have to find the answer
I feel it oh so well
So why is it hard for you to tell?
You'd make my life easier
Make my life easier
(Chorus)
Please find the time
And make a decision
Now is the right time
To answer this question
(Chorus)
So we'll never go our separate ways
