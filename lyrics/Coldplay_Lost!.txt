Just because I'm losin'
Doesn't mean I'm lost
Doesn't mean I'll stop
Doesn't mean I'm across
Just because I'm hurtin'
Doesn't mean I'm hurt
Doesn't mean I didn't get what I deserved
No better and no worse

I just got lost
Every river that I tried to cross
Every door I ever tried was locked
Oh, and I'm just waitin' 'til the shine wears off

You might be a big fish
In a little pond
Doesn't mean you've won
'Cause along may come a bigger one

And you'll be lost
Every river that you tried to cross
Every gun you ever held went off
Oh, and I'm just waitin' 'til the firin' stopped
Oh, and I'm just waitin' 'til the shine wears off

Oh, and I'm just waitin' 'til the shine wears off (Oh, oh, oh)
Oh, and I'm just waitin' 'til the shine wears off (Oh-oh-oh, oh, oh)
(Oh, oh, oh)
(Oh-oh-oh, oh, oh)
