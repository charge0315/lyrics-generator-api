Wouldn't change a thing about you
If I were king and I ruled the world
I would make it safe for the boys and girls
There's so much I'd do
But I wouldn't change a thing about you
If the summer could last 'til spring
Or a fallen sparrow could sprout new wings
Then I'd change that, too
But I wouldn't change a thing about you
(Wouldn't change a thing about you)
All the love that you've been giving
All the joy that we've been living through
I wouldn't change a thing about you
(Wouldn't change a thing)

Too little love and too much hate
When times get tough
Looking for somethin' 'cause
I just can't get enough
But when I'm feelin' down
You're there to see me through
I wanna hold ya, touch ya
Give you love all the time
'Cause when I'm with you, girl
I feel like the world is mine
Tell you, baby, there's nothing
I wouldn't do for you
The sun comes out when I hear your name
I get butterflies, do you feel the same?
That's what love can do
No, I wouldn't change a thing about you
(Wouldn't change a thing about you)
In this imperfect world we live in
Perfect love like ours is rare, it's true
I wouldn't change a thing about you
(Wouldn't change a thing)
(Bridge)
Hey, if I were king, I would rule the world
I would make it safe for the boys and girls
There's so much I'd do
But I wouldn't change a thing about you
(Wouldn't change a thing about you)
All the love that you've been giving
All the joy that we've been living through
I wouldn't change a thing about you
(Wouldn't change a thing about you)
Na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na na na
Na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na na-na-na na na na
I wouldn't change a thing about you
(Wouldn't change a thing about you)
