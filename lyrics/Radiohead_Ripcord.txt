Soul destroyed with clever toys for little boys
It's inevitable, inevitable, it's a soul destroyed

You're free until you drop
You're free until you've had enough
But you don't understand

You've no ripcord
No ripcord
No ripcord
No ripcord

Aeroplane, do I mean what I mean?
Oh, it's inevitable, inevitable, oh, aeroplane

A thousand miles an hour
And politics in power
That you don't understand

You've no ripcord
No ripcord
No ripcord
No ripcord

The answer to your prayers
We'll drop you anywhere

With no ripcord
No ripcord
No ripcord
N-n-no ripcord
Yeah
