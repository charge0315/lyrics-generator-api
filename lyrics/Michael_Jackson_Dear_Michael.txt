She wrote: "Dear Michael
You'll probably never get this letter, Michael
I wrote you a hundred times before
Knowing how I feel, I'll write a hundred more"

"Dear Michael (Michael, Michael)
Every time (She wrote) your record's on, Michael (Michael, Michael)
I close my eyes (She wrote) and sing along
Dreaming you're singing to me"

And then, she wrote: "Michael, I love you
I've held the tears back long as I can
I'm sealing my feelings in this envelope
'Cause I wanna be more than just your number one fan"

I'm gonna answer your letter (Michael, Michael)
I'll start beginning (She wrote) with the ABC's of loving you (Michael, Michael)
Your letter (She wrote) really touched my heart
I've been dreaming of
Meeting the picture that you sent along
Signed with all your love

(Michael, Michael)
(I wrote you)
(She wrote)
I'm going to write you back, ooh
I promise you that

Girl, I think I love you
(Michael, Michael) (I wrote you, she wrote)
Hurry, hurry, Mr. Postman (Won't you write me back?)
(Please write me back) Take my letter, tell her I love her
(Michael, Michael) (I wrote you, she wrote)
Hurry, hurry, Mr. Postman (Won't you write me back?)
(Please write me back) Take my letter, tell her I love her
(Michael, Michael) Yeah
(I wrote you) (She wrote)
I'm gonna write you back
I promise you that
Tell her I love her
(Ooh)
