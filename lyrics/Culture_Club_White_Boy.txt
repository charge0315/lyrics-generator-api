Black boys employ Selassie
We kiss we define
White hands white hearts
The gender
How can I make you mine
Take me to God
In a world of blank kisses
Who breaks the colours
I know what this is
A one man show
That's how we know
That's how we know
You're white does the blood flow
You're white dance like an enemy
You're white dance like an enemy
You're white dance like an enemy
White boys fall out
In a whirl of decisions
Show me what is
Then show me what isn't
A heart too slow
That's how we know
That's how we know
You're white does the blood flow
You're white dance like an enemy
You're white dance like an enemy
You're white dance like an enemy
You're so white
You're white
White boy
White boy
White boy
White boy
White boy
White boy
White boy dance
Do something sweet
Like pull my heart
Like use your feet
Like steal some culture
Let's fake this dance
A white boy kiss
A white boy chance
Don't take me over
Don't lose my heart
When I change colour I'm here stop
You're white
You're white
You're white
You're white dance like an enemy
You're white dance like an enemy
You're white dance like an enemy (x2)
Hey devil kiss me
I'm taking chances
Not faking my culture
The rhythm it dances
I love your wisdom
I love your mind
White boys are babies (not my kind)
This lust is fashion
That's my sin
By falling out
We're falling in
Now I'm broken
Watch it flow
I'm taking over
Can't let go (falling out with the bad boys)
