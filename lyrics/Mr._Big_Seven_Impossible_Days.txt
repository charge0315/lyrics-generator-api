Sunday morning, out of my mind
Feel like it's going to waste
25 years, 7 impossible days
Monday morning, I'll never find
Someone with strength to betray
25 years, 7 impossible days
People are walking, leaving behind
Someone who wants them to stay
Everyone's talking out of their minds
See that they're gone
Afraid that they're coming to stay
Friday morning, got through the grind
Find me a woman who lays
My head to bed in 7 impossible ways
People are walking, leaving behind
Someone who wants them to stay
Everyone's talking out of their minds
See that they're gone
Afraid that they're coming to stay
Sunday morning, out of my mind
Feel like it's going to waste
25 years, 7 impossible days
7 impossible days
7 impossible days
7 impossible days
