S-e-r-g-i-o you know?
Will.i.am shape and move
This new genre hip-hop
Samba, soul
Bossa nova, urban classical
Pumping sonic from your audio
From El Sudando to São Paulo
W, I with double L
I am and I will
Show and tell y'all
That this fusion will never fail
So read it on the L and read it well
If you black we broke it up as well
Cause we rock ya and we rock ya well
Cause we rock ya and we rock ya well
Cause we rock ya and we rock ya well
Cause we rock ya and we rock ya well
Cause we rock ya and we rock ya well
Cause we rock ya and we rock ya well
Cause we rock ya and we rock ya well
Cause we rock ya and we rock ya well
All my people
Break dancing on my left
Shaka shaka sha
Take it to the middle and get hot
All my dancing
Capoeiring to my right
Zhaka, zhaka zha
Take it to the floor 'n' don't stop
If your samba in the back
Zhaka zhaka zha
Take it to the floor get loose
If your up against
The wall with subduse
Zhaka, zhaka zha
Come on get doing what you do
Do what you do, Do what you know
Don't hold it back just let it go
Make it silent like a silent O
Rhythmically we Africano
More liylicly on piano
It's Maestro Sergi-add-a O
It's Maestro Sergi-add-a O
It's Maestro Sergi-add-a O
It's Maestro Sergi-add-a O
It's Maestro Sergi-add-a O
It's Maestro Sergi-add-a O
It's Maestro Sergi-add-a O
It's Maestro Sergi-add-a O
It's Maestro Sergi-add-a O
We make this butter like butter on
Pop Pop the pop the popcorn
And you can't stop us once we on
Cause once we on i know your on
It's the S-E-R the I the O
Will.I.Am is in control
I think you know
(Check it)
All my people
Break dancing on my left
Shaka shaka sha
Take it to the middle and get hot
All my dancing
Capoeiring to my right
Zhaka, zhaka zha
Take it to the floor 'n' don't stop
If your samba in the back
Zhaka zhaka zha
Take it to the floor get loose
If your up against the wall
With subduse
Zhaka, zhaka zha
Come on get doing what you do
