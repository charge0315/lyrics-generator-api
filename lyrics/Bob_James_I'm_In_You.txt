Will you miss me when I'm gone
Will you ever think of me
Will the past be just today
Filled with broken memories

If you cry yourself to sleep
As I did for you for so long
Then perhaps you'll dream of me
Will you miss me when I'm gone

Though you say that we are through
And that I will have to go
But I love you just the same
More than you will ever know

When you hair has turned to white
And you feel so all alone
Maybe then you'll think of me
Will you miss me when I'm gone
