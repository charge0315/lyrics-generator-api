Never take a chance
I grew up believing
If you take a chance you'll only end up regretting
Taking a chance at all
Never take a step
In the wrong direction
Risk my heart
Fall for someone
Was out of the question

Until you came into my life
I never took any chances on love
I never would
You said baby believe me
And girl if you leave me
No one will ever see me take chances again

Never give your heart
Put yourself in danger
That's the way I thought it had to be
For me
Never take a chance
Maybe I've been hiding
All my chances passed me by
While I was deciding

Until you came into my life
I never took any chances on love
I never would
You said baby believe me
So girl don't you leave me

I used to think my destiny
Was living alone
Keeping my heart locked away
No one could ever get to me
Until you came into my life

Until you came into my life
I never took any chances on love
I never would
You said baby believe me
And girl if you leave me
No one will ever see me take chances again
Never take a chance
