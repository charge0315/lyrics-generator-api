Two happy people on a Greyhound bus
We came here looking for a life for us
But the nightlife is her new life and the only thing I've found is
San Francisco is a lonely town
Oh, there were good times for a little while
But now her new friends say I cramp her style
I guess I'm only in the way now and she don't need me hanging round
San Francisco is a lonely town
Now she's out there somewhere across the Bay
And she'll be wondering where I am when she gets in today
She'll find I've left her a oneway ticket home
And while she stands there crying all alone
And while the Greyhound keeps on rolling I'll pray the Lord she's found
San Francisco is a lonely town
San Francisco is a lonely town...
