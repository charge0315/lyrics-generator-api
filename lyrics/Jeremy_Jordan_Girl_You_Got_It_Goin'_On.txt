Hey.. oh oh.. oh baby!
I can't take it when you teased this heart of mine, You got me tripped in cuz straight up baby you're so fine... Everywhere you go the fellas all stop and stare, Just say the word girl and I'll be there..
CHORUS: Cuz I can't help the things I do, Girl you got it goin' on..hey.. Baby I just wanna get with you, Girl you got it goin' on..oh.. Yeah, goin on yeah..
Soending dollars just to pleased you everyday, and nothing girl cuz sometimes it's just be that way, Everybody says I'm acting just like a fool, But all this sparin' lovin, I love you...
I can't help the things I do (yeah baby) Girl you got it goin' on..Oh baby i just wann get with you, You got it goin on..
Things turn around, take a look us now, the love we found together, When I see you with somebody else, Startin' make a fool of myself, can nobody love you baby.....
Girl you got it goin on.. (You got it goin on) And baby I just wanna get with you.. You got it goin' on..
Oh I love the you hug, And I love the you love, I love the way you show your hair, baby, You got it goin' on, Oh I love the way you wear, your hair, and I love the you make me stare, I love the way you make me do, what you want me to do even if I don't..I love the way you walk, and I love the way you talk, I love the way you do what you do, you got it goin' on.. hey yey...
I just can't help myself, I wanna get with you, you got it goin' on yeah.. (4x)
