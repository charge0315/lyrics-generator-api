I guess this time you're really leavin'
I heard your suitcase say goodbye
Well, as my broken heart lies bleedin'
You say true love is suicide
You say you've cried a thousand rivers
And now you're swimmin' for the shore
You left me drownin' in my tears
And you won't save me anymore
I pray to God you'll give me one more chance, girl

I'll be there for you, these five words I swear to you
When you breathe, I wanna be the air for you
I'll be there for you
I'd live and I'd die for you, I'd steal the sun from the sky for you
Words can't say what love can do
I'll be there for you

I know you know we've had some good times
Now they have their own hidin' place
Well, I can promise you tomorrow
But I can't buy back yesterday

And, baby, you know my hands are dirty
And baby, you know my hands are dirty
But I wanted to be your Valentine
I'll be the water when you get thirsty, baby
When you get drunk, I'll be the wine, woah

I'll be there for you, these five words I'd swear to you
When you breathe, I wanna be the air for you
I'll be there for you
I'd live and I'd die for you, I'd steal the sun from the sky for you
Words can't say what love can do
I'll be there for you

I wasn't there when you were happy
I wasn't there to make you happy
And I wasn't there when you were down, child
Didn't mean to miss your birthday, baby
I wish I'd seen you blow those candles out
Oh-oh

I'll be there for you, these five words I'd swear to you
When you breathe, I wanna be the air for you
I'll be there for you
I'd live and I'd die for you, I'd steal the sun from the sky for you
Words can't say what love can do
I'll be there for
I'll be there for you, these five words I'd swear to you
When you breathe, I wanna be the air for you
I'll be there for you
I'd live and I'd die for you, steal the sun from the sky for you
Words can't say what love can do
I'll be there for you

Woah-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh-woah
