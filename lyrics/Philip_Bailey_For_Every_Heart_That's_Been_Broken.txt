I know, baby, yes, I know
Yes, I know that he hurt you
I can see it in your eyes
You pretend it doesn't matter
But you feel it all so deep inside
You know you've been running from love
And you keep saying you've had enough
For every heart that's been broken
Two have been in love
So, baby, don't give up, oh no
'Cause there's never
A heart that's been broken
That can't make love again
And I'm waiting to get you into my life
Love is the whisper
When all the talking's done
And you don't know you're in it
Until after it's begun
Somewhere deep in this night
We'll find each other and know it's right
For every heart that's been broken
Two have been in love
So, baby, don't give up, oh no
'Cause there's never
A heart that's been broken
That can't make love again
And I'm waiting to get you in
Come on in, come on in
It only takes one to be lonely
So why don't the two of us take a chance?
For every heart that's been broken
Two have been in love
Baby, baby, baby, don't you give up
'Cause there's never
A heart that's been broken
That can't make love again
And I'm waiting, waiting, waiting
Just to get you into my life
For every heart that's been broken
Two have been in love
Just to get you into my life
'Cause there's never
A heart that's been broken
That can't make love again
Don't give it up, girl, no, no, no
For every heart that's been broken
Two have been in love
