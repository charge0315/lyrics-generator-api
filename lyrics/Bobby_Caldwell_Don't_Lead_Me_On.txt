Don't make advances
If you can't follow through
Don't whisper words in my ear
That might not come true
They seldom do
My heart's been broken so much I've lost track
And it's taken this long to mend
So don't say you love me and then take it back
'Cause I couldn't bear it again

Don't lead me on
Don't play with my emotions baby
I've just got to know it's for real
And the love that you feel is strong
Is that so wrong
Don't lead me on

You keep making passes
Don't play games with my heart
Don't fool around
You've got to mean what you say
And you can't walk away
Once you start
When you move closer it's hard to resist
And I know I could easily fall
I'd rather live with the chance that I'll miss
Than end up with nothing at all

Don't lead me on
Don't toy with my affections baby
Why should I surrender my heart
Just to wake up and find you've gone
With no so long
Don't lead me on

Don't lead me on
Don't play with my emotions baby
I've just got to know it's for real
And the love that you feel is strong
Is that so wrong
Don't lead me on
