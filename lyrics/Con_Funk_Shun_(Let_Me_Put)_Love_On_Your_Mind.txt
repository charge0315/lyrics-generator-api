You hide in your room
You won't share your love
With nobody else, well, well
You feel safe and warm
Locked in a world
That you made for yourself
Don't you think it's time
You tried to find
Someone
To take care of you, oh
Let me put love on your mind
Let me be the one to put a smile in your life
Let me put love on your mind
Let me put love on your mind
You can't go on
Hiding your feelings
Your whole life through, oh, yeah
You're being half a woman
Oh, until love
Becomes part of you, yeah
Don't you think it's time
You tried to find
Someone
To fulfill your needs, oh
Let me put love on your mind
Let me be the one to put a smile in your life
Let me put love on your mind
Let me put love on your mind
Don't you think
It's time you tried to find
Someone
To fulfill your needs, oh
Let me put love on your mind
Let me be the one to put a smile in your life
Let me put love on your mind
Let me put love on your mind
Let me put love
(Oh, baby, yeah)
(Make you feel safe and warm
Safe and warm, yeah)
Let me put love
(Oh, baby, yeah)
Let me put love on your mind
