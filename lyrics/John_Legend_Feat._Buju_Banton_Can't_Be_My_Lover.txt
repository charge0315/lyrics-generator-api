Have ah piece of body wey every good gyal deserve
But I won't allow this girl to mess with my nerves
Blessed figure, not to mention the curves
Through the corner of her eyes she slowly observe (Sing out)

Any time she come around
Something is about to go down (Go down)
Listen to the siren sound
Wake up, wake up right now
'Cause if I was to go to sleep
Might catch me dreaming of a way to creep
Trouble always seems to follow me
Oh, don't follow me now

(Over and over and over again)
I tried to tell her no, no, no, I already have a friend
(Over and over she's reeling me in)
She said nobody has to know, but I've got to let her go

So I had to walk on by (She can't be my lover)
She's flashing me them pretty brown eyes (She can't be my lover)
Though there's green grass on the other side (She can't be my lover)
All I can say is hi (She can't be my lover), listen, listen right now

Any time she hear the beat
She be dancing right in front of me
Trying to lure me in-between the sheets
But I'm a man and I still get weak
But I'll be damned if I lose my girl (Girl)
But I'll be damned if I don't touch her (Touch her)
Curiosity, it killed the cat
Oh, and I don't want that, so

(Over and over and over again)
Tried to tell her no, no, no, I already have a friend
(Over and over she's reeling me in)
She said nobody has to know, but I've got to let her go

So I had to walk on by (She can't be my lover)
Flashing me them pretty brown eyes (She can't be my lover)
Though there's green grass on the other side (She can't be my lover)
All I can say is hi (She can't be my lover), listen, listen right now

I couldn't let you pass even if I try
Have a bird in the hand, why chase one in the sky?
Sexy female refuse to comply
Plus she is an empress who want ah stand-by
Been receiving love but she can't satisfy
Would like to have my cake and even enjoy the pie
Politely decline like me shy
Honey say me soft, come on, give it a try
Look in ah me eyes with seductive eyes
Filled with deception, trouble and lies
And I don't want no more problems in-a me life
Asked me fi me number so that we could enjoy the night, she wanna come over

(Over and over and over again)
Tried to tell her no, no, no, I already have a friend
(Over and over she's reeling me in)
Oh, nobody has to know, but I've got to let her go

So I had to walk on by (She can't be my lover)
Flashing me them pretty brown eyes (She can't be my lover)
Though there's green grass on the other side (She can't be my lover)
All I can say is hi (She can't be my lover), listen, listen right now

Listen, listen right now
Listen, listen right now
Listen, listen right now
Listen, listen right now
