Woo

Smackwater Jack
He bought him a shotgun
'Cause he was in the mood
For a little confrontation
He just let it all hang loose
He didn't think about the noose
He couldn't take no more abuse
So he shot down the congregation

You can't talk to a man
With a shotgun in his hand (Shotgun)
I'm talkin' 'bout Smack
No, no, no, no, no, no (No no, no no no no)

Now, Big Jim the chief
He stood for law and order
He called for the guard to come
And surround the border
From his bulldog mouth
As he led the posse south
Came the cry, "We got to ride
To clean up the streets
For our wives and our daughters"

You can't talk to a man
When he don't wanna understand (Shotgun)
I'm talkin' 'bout Smackwater Jack
No, no, no, no, no, no (No no, no no no no)

The account of the capture
Wasn't in the papers
But you knew they hanged old Smack right then
Instead of later
You know the people were quite pleased
'Cause the outlaw had been seized
And on the whole it was a very good year
For the undertaker

You know, you know, you can't talk to a man
With a shotgun in his hand (Shotgun)

Smackwater Jack, yeah
Smackwater Jack bought a shotgun
Yeah, Smackwater Jack bought a shotgun
Oh, Smackwater Jack, yeah
Smackwater Jack, yeah
Talkin' 'bout Smackwater Jack, yeah
Woo
Ooh, bought a shotgun
Talkin' 'bout Smackwater Jack, yeah, bought a shotgun
Smackwater Jack and his shotgun (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Smackwater Jack, yeah (Woo)
Smackwater Jack and his shotgun (No, no, no, no, no, no, no)
Talkin' 'bout Smack, talkin' 'bout Jack
Smackwater Jack and his shotgun
