Don't look now
But this good thing could go astray
And I can't watch you throw away
What was right from the start
You don't want to tear apart
(Don't want to tear apart what could be saved)

Why can't you face what was meant to take place in this life?
Don't try to move
There's no way to improve on a perfect design

It was meant to be
Darling, you belong to me
It was meant to be
Darling, you belong to me

How could you think that I would allow
Anything to divide us now?
And it can't be denied
We could save what might have died
(Your place is by my side, baby)

Why can't you face what was meant to take place in this life?
Don't try to move
There's no way to improve on a perfect design

It was meant to be
Darling, you belong to me
It was meant to be
Darling, you belong to me
It was meant to be
Darling, you belong to me
It was meant to be
Darling, you belong to me
