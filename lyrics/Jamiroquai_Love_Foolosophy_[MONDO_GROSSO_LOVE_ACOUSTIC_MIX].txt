Love Foolosophy
Jamiroquai
Oh, baby baby, I feel these sweet sensations, yeah
Honey honey, looks like a superstar, yeah yeah
She's got a promise of love-struck fascination
Oh, What am I to do? How am I to know?
Who you are?
And this love, fool...osophy is killing
Previous illusions that (I'm a love fool)
I had in my mind about you (I'm a love fool)
Seems so true
All the lies you're telling
Tragically compelling and (I'm a love fool)
My love it means nothing to you
So maybe I'm still a love fool
She shimmers like a California sunset
Lady lady, glitters but there's no gold
She carries sweetly infectious, magic formulas
I'm so delirious, is she that serious?
Or is she bringing me on, I've been waiting so long
Chorus
I don't want the world I want you
(Yeah,) I don't want the world I want you
(You,) I don't want the world I want you
I want you (4x)
Chorus
You're my love foolosophy (I'm a love fool)
Don't you see it's killing me
You're my love foolosophy (I'm a love fool)
Don't you see it's killing me, oh
I'm a love fool
