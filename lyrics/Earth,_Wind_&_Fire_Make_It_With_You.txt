Ah, ah, ah, we can make it
We can make it, yeah
Hey, have you ever tried
Really reachin' out for the other side
I may be climbin' on a rainbow
But, baby, here it goes
Dreams are for those who sleep
Life is for us to keep
If you're wondering what this all is leading to
Ooo, hey, I'd like to make it with ya
I really think that we can make it, babe
No, you don't know me well
And every little thing only time will tell
If you do the things that I do
Ooo, we'll see it through
Life can be short and it can be long
Love can be right or wrong
If I had to choose just one to see me through
And, hey, I'd like to make it with ya
I really think that we can make it, babe
Ah, ah, ah, we can make it
No, you don't know me well
And every little thing only time will tell
If you do the things that I do
Ooo, we'll see it through
And I wanna make it, yeah
Ah, ah, ah, we can make it
We can make it, yeah
Ah, ah, ah, we can make it
We can make it, yeah
Awww, put your hands together
Put your hands together
Put your hands together
Put your hands together
Get your heart together
