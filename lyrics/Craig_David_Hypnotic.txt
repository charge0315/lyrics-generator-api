Uh, what? Ha, come on
Mmm, yeah, no no no no
That's right
Hey, yeah, yeah, no
So hypnotic, oh, hey, no, no
Ha, yeah, yeah, yeah, uh, yeah

I stepped into the club
Clocked this fly girl, shakin' her stuff now
Looking so hot, I couldn't help but say yeah
Moves to make a brother wanna go there
I'm talking unbelievable
Never seen a girl quite like this before now
Trying to figure out what I gotta do
To get the chance to spend a moment with you

'Cause girl, you're looking so damn fly tonight
And I know I'd like to take it there, alright
What you've got is breaking all of the rules
So keep doing what you're doing, ooh baby

She's so hypnotic
The way she moves on the floor, she's got it
The way she making me feel, I shouldn't want it
But this girl, she's so sexy
So hypnotic, got every girl up in this club trying to top it
But that don't mean that this girl is gon' stop it
Oh no, she's so sexy (Verse)

No time for drinks at the bar
Even though she's got me so hot at the risk of losing it all
I don't wanna be the one, the fool to let her go
Think it's about time that I drop my cool and let her know, that
She's sensational, got me watching every move
And it got me begging for more, well
Holding back, it nearly drove me crazy
That's when I slid up and said, "Girl, excuse me"

Mmm, you're looking so damn fly tonight
Your body gives me butterflies inside
I'd really like to talk to you, ha
So keep doing what you're doing
Ooh baby

She's so hypnotic
The way she moves on the floor, she's got it
The way she's making me feel, I shouldn't want it
But this girl, she's so sexy (This girl, so sexy)
So hypnotic
Got every girl up in this club trying to top it
But that don't mean that this girl is gon' stop it
Oh no, she's so sexy (This girl, so sexy)

Thought I'd seen everything in the world
(Thought I'd seen everything in the world)
But that all changed for me tonight
(But that all changed for me tonight)
From the moment I looked in your eyes, girl
(Ooh, you blew my mind)
I know it's crazy but don't get me wrong
(I know it's crazy but don't get me wrong)
I just gotta have you in my life, girl
Your vibe's just so hypnotic
Oh, baby, uh, woo-woo-woo-woo
Oh, yeah

So hypnotic
The way she moves on the floor, she's got it (Baby)
The way she's making me feel, I shouldn't want it (Shouldn't want it, no)
But this girl, she's so sexy
So hypnotic (So hypnotic)
Got every girl up in this club trying to top it (Oh)
But that don't mean that this girl is gon' stop it (Stop it)
Oh no, she's so sexy
She's so hypnotic
The way she moves on the floor, she's got it (Hey, hey)
The way she making me feel, I shouldn't want it
But this girl, she's so sexy (So sexy)
So hypnotic (So hypnotic, yeah)
Got every girl up in this club trying to top it (Top it)
But that don't mean that this girl is gon' stop it
Oh no, she's so sexy (Oh no)

Yeah, ooh

Ooh baby
Oh, oh

Yeah
She's so hypnotic
Uh, oh whoa, yeah, yeah
