Nobody ever loved me (quite like you do)
Your love is like...

Got a real girl and she loves me a lot
And ain't no other man that's gonna take-a my spot
And I, I'm so happy your mine
Cause I'mma love you long time

Let me love you a long time
Let me love
Let me love you a long time
Let me love
Let me love you a long time
Let me love
Let me love you a long time
OH!
Let me, let me love you!
Let me, let me love you!
Let me, let me love you

I never knew someone like you, oh no (oh no)
And I never felt the way I do before, before (before)

I don't wanna lose ya
Won't ever misuse ya
If you ever left baby
I swear I would lose it
Maybe I should cool it
I know I'm acting foolish
Nobody ever loved me (quite like you)

Got a real girl and she loves me a lot
And ain't no other man that's gonna take-a my spot
And I, I'm so happy your mine
Cause I'mma love you long time

Let me love you a long time
Let me love
Let me love you a long time
Let me love you a long time
Let me love
Let me love you a long time

This is the sweetest thing I know
For sure, for sure
And you, you give me reason
To hold on

I don't wanna lose ya
Won't ever misuse ya
If you ever left baby
I swear I would lose it
Maybe I should cool it
I know I'm acting foolish
Nobody ever loved me (quite like you)

Got a real girl and she loves me a lot
And ain't no other man that's gonna take-a my spot
And I, I'm so happy your mine
Cause I'mma love you long time

I'mma love you a long time
I'mma love you a long time
I'mma love you a long time
Whoa
I'mma love you a long time
I'mma love you a long, long, long, time
Whoa
Let me, let me love you
Let me, let me love you
OH
Let me, let me love you
Baby

Got a real girl and she loves me a lot
And ain't no other man that's gonna take-a my spot
And I, I'm so happy your mine
Cause I'mma love you long time
