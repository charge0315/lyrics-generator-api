They say
A bird in hand is better than two in a bush
And they say
That everybody slow down is going to take a second look
Of something new, but in my search for something new
I find there's no one better than you
So this time if you can forgive me girl
Oh I have come I have come to stay (to stay)
I have come I have come to stay (to stay)
I have come I've come to stay
But everybody sometimes is going to make a mistake
And they say it's a much better man
Who has the heart to admit it
And I do
Cause' curiosity killed the cat
And I pray every day you haven't forgot me yet
So this time if you can forgive me girl
I have come I have come to stay (to stay)
I have come I have come to stay (to stay)
I have come I've come to stay (to stay)
But in my search for something new
Girl I find there's no one better than you
So this time (this time)
Oh I have come I've come to stay (to stay)
Oh girl I have come yes I've come to stay (to stay)
I have come to stay I've come to stay (to stay)
I have come
Everyday yeah I have come
I have come Gonna be with you girl
(I have come to stay) I'm gonna love you, yes I will
Everyday I have come to stay
You can depend on me, yeah
I have come to stay
