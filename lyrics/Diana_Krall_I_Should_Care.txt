I should care
I should go around weeping
And I should care
I should go without sleeping
Strangely enough I sleep well
Except for a dream or two
But then I count my sheep well
Funny how sheep can lull you to sleep
* No, I,(and) I should care
I should let it upset me
(And) I should care
But it just doesn't get me
May be I won't find someone
As lovely as you
But I should care
And I do
*(repeat)
