Dream, a dream is like a movie
A castle on a mountain
A garden with a fountain
I seem to be a lady
It's just a dream
But maybe I'm the queen
(Oh-oh)
Dream, the wonder of the tropics
And how to feel creation
With no need of vibration
Tonight you are invited
Tonight you'll be delighted
There will be only you and me
(Ah-ah-ah-ah)
Tropical summernight
You never saw a moon so bright
Forget about your sorrow
Don't think about tomorrow
Blame it on a summernight (oh-oh)
A tropical summernight (oh-oh)
Tropical summernight
Falling in love is pure delight
Truly once I love you
A million stars above you
A tropical summernight (oh-oh)
A tropical summernight
Dream, a dream is like a movie
Like island full of magic
With story full of tragic
My heart is almost dying
Tomorrow you must fly away from me (oh-oh)
Slow motion
We walk along the ocean
The night is slowly falling
The lonely birds are calling
You know that I will miss you
You're close to me, I kiss you
Tonight you're gonna stay with me
(Ah-ah-ah-ah)
Tropical summernight
You never saw a moon so bright
Forget about your sorrow
Don't think about tomorrow
Blame it on a summernight (oh-oh)
A tropical summernight (oh-oh)
Tropical summernight
Falling in love is pure delight
Truly once I love you
A million stars above you
A tropical summernight (oh-oh)
A tropical summernight
(Oh-oh, ah-ah)
(Oh-oh, ah-ah)
Tropical summernight
You never saw a moon so bright
Forget about your sorrow
Don't think about tomorrow
Blame it on a summernight (oh-oh)
A tropical summernight (oh-oh)
Tropical summernight
Falling in love is pure delight
Truly once I love you
A million stars above you
A tropical summernight (oh-oh)
A tropical summernight (oh-oh)
