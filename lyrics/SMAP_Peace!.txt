There never goes a day, living in bliss
Tears dropping down from eyes, everyone would rather die
Not living mentally sick, spending life in a ditch
Can't derail success, gotta prove why we're at best
Can't depend on others to fight for the truth
When we're just better off with a mindset that's new
Taking it, day by day, opening this jar
But the negativity begins to raid, the positivity exists afar
You will see the day, when you will be at pеace
Promise you will see the day
Whеn you and your world... is at peace
We're born to create, not to hate
