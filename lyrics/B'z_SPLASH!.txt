Running around with everything in town
Here she comes up, there she goes down on me again
How it's always been
Swing left, to the right, hitting everything in sight
Got the green light, get it just right, till it overflows
Yeah, here I go
Wonder if I'm ever gonna change
Will I ever play the straightaway?
Can I even stop this Dosey Doe?
We're just playin' cause it feels alright
But the time keeps movin' at the speed of light
Maybe tomorrow I'll wake up and need another way (IT'S A NEW DAY)
I'm just sayin' it's not outta sight
I been surveyin' at the end of the night
I need to hold onto somethin' or I'm gonna crash
California Splash!
Hollywood soufflé, got it on display
Demolition mama loosen screws in my brain again
Oh, such sweet sin
SoCal superfreak feelin' the heat
Calling out a mayday to heaven, before I explode (SUPERFREAK)
Yeah, here it goes
I wonder if I'm ever gonna stay
What they gonna say on Judgment Day?
Can I even stop it? I don't know...
We're just playin' cause it feels alright
But the time keeps movin' at the speed of light
Maybe tomorrow I'll wake up and see another way (IT'S A NEW DAY)
I'm just sayin' it's not outta sight
I've been surveyin' at the end of the night
I need to hold onto something or I'm gonna crash
Cause we all wanna play with dynamite
It's in mother nature to ignite
Maybe the answers lie inside the Milky Way (WHAT'S THE RIGHT WAY?)
I can't say if it's black or white
But the red light's flashin' everything in sight
Need to get a grip on something, I need it fast
California Splash!
Hara sae kukureba kowakunai (腹さえくくればこわくない)

We all just playin' cause it feels alright
The time keeps movin' at the speed of light
Maybe tomorrow I'll wake up and see another way (GO FLY AWAY)
I'm just sayin' it's not outta sight
I been surveyin' at the end of the night
I need to hold onto something, I need it fast
Cause we all just tryin' to get it right
Lookin' for answers to survive
Aim for the wave, I'm cravin' it today (NEED THE BLUE SPRAY)
I can't say if it's black or white
But the red light's flashin' in my eyes
Throw me down somethin', I need it fast
California Splash!
