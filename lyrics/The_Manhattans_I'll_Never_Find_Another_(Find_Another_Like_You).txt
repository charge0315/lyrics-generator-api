I'll never find another
Find another like you
To make all my dreams come true
Now I'm so blue
I'll never find another
Find another like you
To make all my dreams come true
What should I do
Sitting here looking at your picture
At a smile time can't erase
And like reflections in a mirror, I see you
Holdin' hands with a guy of a different face, yeah
Oh, since you've been gone I've been trembling
Of the need to hold you close
But I've been caught in a syndrome of pridе
Oh, baby, from love you just can't hide, no
I'll nevеr find another
Find another like you
To make all my dreams come true
Now I'm so blue
I'll never find another
Find another like you
To make all my dreams come true
What should I do
Sitting reminiscing, lost in thoughts of yesterday
Don't wanna face reality because you're not here with me
Lost in the past, don't think I'll last
Without your love, without your love, yeah
Oh, since you've been gone, I've been trembling
Of the need to hold you close
But I've been caught in the syndrome of pride
Oh, baby, from love you just can't hide, no
I'll never find another
Find another like you
To make all my dreams come true
What should I do
Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba
I'll never find another
Find another like you
To make all my dreams come true
Now I'm so blue
I'll never find another
Find another like you
To make all my dreams come true
What should I do
