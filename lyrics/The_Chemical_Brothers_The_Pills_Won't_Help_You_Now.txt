Thought we were going
To go up the field a ways
To join all the other living souls
But you never came
Robbed of your fortune
They gave disappointments and lies
You're probably poisoning your body
I hope you're alright

In a moment of fear
You dig in your heels
The pills won't help you now
Won't you cry
