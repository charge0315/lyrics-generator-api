Double D, big full breasts on my baby (Yo, we goin' to Florida)
Triple weight, couldn't weigh the love I've got for the girl
And I just wanna know, why you ain't been goin' to work?
Boss ain't workin' you like this, he can't take care of you like this

Now you're lost, lost in the heat of it all
Girl, you know you're lost, lost in the thrill of it all
Miami, Amsterdam, Tokyo, Spain, lost
Los Angeles, India, lost on a train, lost

Got on my buttercream silk shirt, and it's Versace (
There he goes, one of God's own prototypes
)
Hand me my triple weight, so I can weigh the work I got on you, girl (
Too weird to live and too rare to die
)
No, I don't really wish, I don't wish the titties would show
No, have I ever, have I ever let you get caught? (Oh)

Lost, lost in the heat of it all
Girl, you know you're lost, lost in the thrill of it all
Miami, Amsterdam, Tokyo, Spain, lost
Los Angeles, India, lost on a train, lost

She's at a stove (
Who?
), can't believe I got her out here cookin' dope (Cookin' dope)
I promise she'll be whippin' meals up for a family of her own some day
Nothin' wrong, no, nothin' wrong with a lie (Nothin' wrong, ain't nothin' wrong, ooh)
Nothin' wrong with another short plane ride through the sky, you and I (Ain't nothin' wrong, ain't nothin' wrong, up in the sky, just you and I)

Lost (Ooh), lost in the heat of it all
Girl, you know you're lost (Ooh), lost in the thrill of it all
Miami, Amsterdam, Tokyo, Spain, lost (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Los Angeles, India, lost on a train, lost (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)

Love lost, lost
Love, love, love lost, lost
Love, love, love lost
Love, love, love lost
Faith is the substance—
¡Manos arriba!—
Any other channel on the—
