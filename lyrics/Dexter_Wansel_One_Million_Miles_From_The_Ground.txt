Take all the time you need to love me
And don't be afraid I won't break
Do anything that you think would please me
And give me as much as I can take

Give me you love
Ooh baby I want it
All of your love
Ooh baby I need it
Make me your cloud
Flying around
One million miles from the ground

Come here inside where its nice and warm
And hold me real tight when it starts to storm
Make me feel glad to know I love you
And you make me so glad when I'm giving it to you

Give me you love
Ooh baby I want it
All of your love
Ooh baby I need it
Make me your cloud
Flying around
One million miles from the ground

Give me you love
Ooh baby I want it
All of your love
Ooh baby I need it
Make me your cloud
Flying around
One million miles from the ground
