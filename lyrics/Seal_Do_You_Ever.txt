She don’t get it he just let it slip away
‘Cause all they’ve been doing is loosing it night and day
Breaking up is harder when you have a higher price to pay
Now she takes a lover so that she can hide the pain
Do you ever forget my name
Do you ever recall our love again
Do you find every now and then
You’ll be somewhere and your life is not the same
When your there with him I’m juts wondering
Do you ever forget my name
All these changes he now faces reality
One night lovers such a big space to fill
But now and then he wonders if its only time they kill
Do you ever forget my name
Do you ever recall our love again
Do you find that every now and then
You’ll be somewhere and your life is not the same
It’s gonna take some time yeah
We got to know that what we did is real
I away, this time going pick my life up again
Sowing what we reap is real
We’re here
It’s real
I took your heart
You took my care
And now you talk
Iike I’m not here
I wish you were
Once and for all
I just hope he’s there to catch you if you fall
Thats all just like always
Do you ever forget my name
Do you ever forget my name
Do you ever forget my name
In the middle of the masquerade there's a clown to see
Everybody’s laughing
Wears his frown upside down
So he can save the tears for when he cries himself to sleep
