"The problem is all inside your head," he said to me
"The answer is easy if you take it logically
I'd like to help you in your struggle to be free
There must be fifty ways to leave your lover"

He said, "It's really not my habit to intrude
Furthermore, I hope my meaning won't be lost or misconstrued
But I'll repeat myself at the risk of being crude
There must be fifty ways to leave your lover"
Fifty ways to leave your lover

Just slip out the back, Jack
Make a new plan, Stan
Don't need to be coy, Roy
Just get yourself free
Mmm, hop on the bus, Gus
You don't need to discuss much
Just drop off the key, Lee
And get yourself free

He said, "It grieves me so to see you in such pain
I wish there was something I could do to make you smile again"
I said, "I appreciate that, and would you please explain
About those fifty ways?"

He said, "Why don't we both just sleep on it tonight
And I believe in the morning, you'll begin to see the light"
And then he kissed me, and I realized he probably was right
There must be fifty ways to leave your lover
Fifty ways to leave your lover

Just slip out the back, Jack
Make a new plan, Stan
Don't need to be coy, Roy
Just get yourself free
Hop on the bus, Gus
Don't need to discuss much
Drop off the key, Lee
And get yourself free
Slip out the back, Jack
Mmm, make a new plan, Stan
Don't need to be coy, Roy
Just listen to me, honey
Hop on the bus, Gus
Don't need to discuss much
Just drop off the key
And get yourself free
