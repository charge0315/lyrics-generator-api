Living in a town that's on the brink of being a city
Won't satisfy my soul though the women may be pretty
My mind is made up
I have had enough
I'm leaving here today
Shops, walls, pavements, streets
Is all that I could find
From head to foot and toe to eye
I looked till I was blind
No matter what turns up
I'm leaving here
This place ain't good enough
You might think that I'm being funny
Just 'coz I won't spend my money here
Well let me tell you I have no obection
Except that I can find correction
Everywhere I go
Jump high in the sky unless you're feeling bitter
About walking down an empty street
With gutters full of litter
My mind is made up
I have had enough
I'm leaving here today, hey, hey
I'm going away
You might think that I'm being funny
Just 'coz I won't spend my money here
Well let me tell you I have no objection
Except that I can find correction
Everywhere I go
Jump high in the sky unless you're feeling bitter
About walking down an empty street
With gutters full of litter
My mind is made up
I have had enough
I'm leaving here today, hey, hey
My mind is made up
I have had enough
I'm leaving right away, hey, hey
I'm going away
Getting out of this place
I know I've said it before
But this time I mean it
I'm leaving
Packing my bags and going away
Getting out of this place
