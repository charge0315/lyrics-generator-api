Here we are - alone, and you're sitting next to me, my dear
I've been waiting for the chance, so, that I can hold you near to me!
Oh, and now, I think the time has come, to let you know, where I'm coming from ...
Chorus: And the only thing that I'm - I'm trying to do-o-o-o-o-o
O - O - O - O- O, I'm trying to get over with you. Just want to let you know how I feel
I'm a try to get over with you. Just want to make you see that my love is real, OOOO
Close your eyes, lay down; let me take you up to heaven for a while
I want to please you, hold you and squeeze you; leave you in the morning with a smile
All of my life, I never wanted anything so much, but, I'd give you anything in the whole wide world just to feel your tender touch
Chorus: And the only thing that I'm - I'm trying to do-o-o-o-o-o
O - O - O - O- O, I'm trying to get over with you. Just want to let you know how I feel
I'm a try to get over with you. Just want to make you see, make you see, my love is real, OOOO
Allll my life, I never wanted anything so much, but, I'd give you anything in the whole wide world just to feel your tender touch
Chorus: But the only thing that I'm - trying to do-o-o-o-o-o - OOOO, Whoo, whoo, who - I'm trying to get over with you. Just want to make you see, yea, that my love is real. I'm a trying to get over - with you. Just want to let you know, let you know, how I feel. Good, God - I'm trying to get over, trying to get over with you, baby. I-I-I got make you understand, I want to be your loving man. Good, God - I'm trying to get over, trying to get over with you, baby. I don't want nobody else; I rather be all alone by myself. I'm just trying to get over, trying to get over with you, baby
