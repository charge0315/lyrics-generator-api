The most beautiful sound I ever heard
Maria, Maria, Maria, Maria
All the beautiful sounds of the world
In a single word
Maria, Maria, Maria, Maria
Maria, Maria, Maria
I’ve just met a girl called Maria
And suddenly that name
Will never be the same to me
Maria
I’ve just kissed a girl named Maria
And suddenly I found
How wonderful a sound can be
Maria
Say it loud and there’s music playing
Say it soft and it’s almost like praying
Maria
I’ll never stop saying Maria
Maria, Maria, Maria, Maria
Maria
Say it loud and there’s music playing
Say it soft and it’s almost like praying
Maria
I’ll never stop saying Maria
The most beautiful sound I ever heard
Maria
