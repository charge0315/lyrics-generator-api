As I look back on some nights in the park
Strange meetings in the dark
I can see you talking to unknown shadow
As the black sky is coming down on us so low
And I wonder why I always keep pleasant memories of the past
Why anything bad or good seems better, once it has passed
I'm facing the ceiling, alone in the dark
Remembering all the things which have left a mark
I find it's hard to see what stands in the shadow
As if somebody didn't want me to know
And I wonder why I always keep pleasant memories of the past
Why anything bad or good seems better, once it has passed
This very personal story may only make sense to me
This very personal story may only make sense to me
This very personal story may only make sense to me
This very personal story may only make sense to me
And I wonder why...
Why I always keep pleasant memories of the past
Why anything bad or good seems better, once it has passed
Once it has passed, once it has passed
