Don’t give up, we need your love
Don’t give up, we need your love
Don’t give up, we need your love
Don’t give up, we need your love
Music people in the city
They’ve all gone underground
I went into my old bar
Man says they’ve all gone underground
No matter how hard they make it
No matter how long it’s been breaking your heart
Just play your guitar
(don’t give up, we need your love)
Play your guitar
(don’t give up, we need your love)
Play your guitar
(don’t give up, we need your love)
Play your guitar
(don’t give up, we need your love)
Music people in this town
They’ve all gone underground
They’ve been working so hard
It’s got to get you down
No matter how hard they make it
No matter how long it’s been breaking your heart
Just play your guitar
(don’t give up, we need your love)
Play your guitar
(don’t give up, we need your love)
Don’t cry
The stars they will align
(it’s time to let ‘em shine)
Don’t cry
The stars are out tonight
Don’t give up, we need your love
Don’t give up, we need your love
(Play your guitar)
Don’t give up, we need your love
Don’t give up, we need your love
Don’t cry
The stars they will align
(it’s time to let ‘em shine)
Don’t cry
Can’t you see the stars are out tonight?
Don’t give up, we need your love
Don’t give up, we need your love
(Play your guitar)
Don’t give up, we need your love
Don’t give up, we need your love
(Play your guitar)
They’re trying to break us down
They’re trying to break us down
They’re trying to break us down
(Play your guitar)
They’re trying to break us down
They’re trying to break us down
They’re trying to break us down
(We need your love)
(Play your guitar)
They’re trying to break us down
They’re trying to break us down
They’re trying to break us down
Can’t you see this is a war?
They’re trying to break us down
They’re trying to break us down
They’re trying to break us down
Can’t you see this is a war?
Can’t you see this is a war?
Can’t you see this is a war?
