I get up when I'm down
I can't swim, but my soul won't drown
I do believe I got flair
I got speed and I walk on air

'Cause God give me soul
In your rock and roll, babe
'Cause God give me soul
In your rock and roll, babe

And I get so high I just can't feel it
And I get so high I just can't feel it
In and out my brain, runnin' through my vein
You're my sunshine, you're my rain

There's a light that shines on
Shines on me and it keeps me warm
It gave me peace, I must say
I can't sleep 'cause the world won't wait

'Cause God give me soul
In your rock and roll, babe
'Cause God give me soul
In your rock and roll, babe

And I get so high I just can't feel it
And I get so high I just can't feel it
In and out my brain, runnin' through my vein
You're my sunshine, you're my rain

And I get so high I just can't feel it
And I get so high I just can't feel it
And I get so high I just can't feel it
And I get so high I just can't feel it
In and out my brain, runnin' through my vein
You're my sunshine, you're my rain
