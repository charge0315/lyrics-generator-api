How are you feeling today, Mister Nelson?
I trust you're having a quick and enjoyable adjustment period
As you can see, we’re communicating now telepathically
(Telepathically)
Telepathically
Which makes things move so much faster here
After you’ve completed the planned affirmation therapy, you’ll find this way of interaction far easier

Until I, I find my, my way back, home, home

You’ve probably felt for many years in your former life
That you were separate from not only others, but even yourself
Now you can see that was never the case
You are actually everything and anything that you can think of
All of it is you

Until I, I find my, my way back, home, home
Until I, I find my, my way back, home
My way back home
Until I, I find my, my way back, home, home
Until I, I find my, my way back, home
Until I, I find my, my way back, home, home

Remember there is really only one destination
And that place is you
All of it
Everything
Is you

Until I, I find my, my way back, home, home
Until I, I find my, my way back, home
