Yes
Ooh, yeah
Everytime I see you
I break down and cry
'Cause anytime I see you
You always are sublime
I wanna be your man, be your world
Be my friend, be my girl
Be the one you're closest to
Oh, 'cause when you're close to me
My heart just wants to speak
And say these words to you
Say these words to you, my baby
Let's make love
In the heat of the night
Making love in the bed, on a rug, near the door, in a tub
On the kitchen floor
Wherever it feels good
Let's make love
Everytime I'm near you
Girl, I get so high
I wanna be inside you
For more than just one night
I wanna be the man in your life, or your lover on a side
Be the one that pleases you
Ooh, whenever you're with me
My heart just wants to speak
And say these words to you, my baby, oh, my baby
Let's make love
In the heat of the night
Making love in the bed, on a rug, near the door, in a tub
On the kitchen floor
Wherever it feels good
Let's make love
Wherever it feels good
Let's make love
And ooh, I love to love you, girl
(love to love you, girl)
Cause you're the ceil above my earth
And no one else but you
I'd cry for you
I'd sacrifice my life for you
That's how you make me feel when we make love
(Oh, we make love) Oh, we make love
Ooh, let's make love tonight, baby
Let's make love
In the heat of the night
Making love in the bed, on a rug, near the door, in a tub
On the kitchen floor
Wherever it feels good
Let's make love
Let's make love
In the heat of the night
Let's make love
Wherever it feels good
Let's make love
Wherever it feels good
Let's make love
