Open up the sky
'Cause I'm coming up to you
So send down your wings
And let 'em bring me to you

You know I'm standing at the station
Ready to go
Oh, big 'ol aeroplane
I'm trusting you so

Get on up big bird, to my baby's love
Get on up big bird, to my baby's love
Get on up big bird
'Cause I got to make it (bird)
Just get on up (big bird)
'Cause I got to make it (bird)
Get on up

With me down here (With me down here)
And you up there (And you up there)
Now all we know is (Now all we know is)
It ain't no fair (It ain't no fair)

'Cause I got love packed in my baggage
Holdin' my claim check
Gonna be with my baby
And never comin' back

Get on up big bird, to my baby's love
Get on up big bird, to my baby's love
Just get on up (big bird)
Up (big bird)
Up (big bird)
Just get on up (big bird)

Open up the sky (open up the sky)
'Cause I'm coming up to you (I'm coming up to you)
So send down your wings (so send down your wings)
And let 'em bring me to you (and bring me to you)

Get on up big bird, to my baby's love
Get on up big bird, to my baby's love
Get on up (big bird)
'Cause I got to make it (big bird)
Just get on up (big bird)
'Cause I got to make it (big bird)
Get on up (big bird)
Get on up (big bird)
Get on up (big bird)
Get on up (big bird)
Just get on up (big bird)
