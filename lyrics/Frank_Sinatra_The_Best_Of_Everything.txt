The best of everything - that's (that is) what I wish you all
The best of everything - a Rembrandt (hanging) on your (the) wall
A yacht that wins you cups
Skateboards with style and speed
Show dogs or loving pups
The pride of the pound or the pedigreed
I hope you win that prize - pass that blue ribbon test
I hope your good keeps getting better - 'til your better's best
With every wine you taste
With every song you sing
By now you may have guest
I hope you get the best of everything
