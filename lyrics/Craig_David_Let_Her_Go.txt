You were her only girl
The most precious thing in her world
And I know it makes you cry
That you never got to say goodbye

You were just running out of time
To say what was on your mind
You never wanted her to leave
And mom, I know it makes you grieve

But why don't you celebrate the moments that you shared, yeah
'Cause now she's watching over you
It's true
And you know it too

Just let her go
If you can't take the pain of a broken heart
Just let her go

I know it feels as though hope is gone
And it hurts to think of moving on
But she'd never wanna see you sad
Even though I know this hurts so bad

Devoted a life to you
And helped raise the grandson too
And now I hope you realise
That I'll always be there by your side

So why don't we celebrate the moments that we shared, yeah
'Cause now she's watching over you
It's true
And you know it too

Just let her go
If you can't take the pain of a broken heart
Just let her go

You never knew how much she tried to fight it (Tried to fight it)
And when you needed her around, well, she'd be there (Oh, she'd be there)
But you can reassure yourself that she's at ease (She's at ease)
And that's why it's time for you (Time for you) to

Just let her go
If you can't take the pain of a broken heart
Just let her go
If you can't take the pain of a broken heart
Just let her go (Just let her go, let her go)
If you can't take the pain of a broken heart
Just let her go (Just let her go, you'll let her)
If you can't take the pain
