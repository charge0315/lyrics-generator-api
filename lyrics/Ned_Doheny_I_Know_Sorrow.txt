A local vision appeared at my door
Shining like an open road
I know that place, that road
And where it all goes
Still a man must cling to something
Until he really knows
Now I know sorrow
The feeling comes and goes
She tells me stories
She learned on the street
Savage tales of make-believe
Soft brown eyes, she knows
That I will not weep
For sure the morning take her
Then it must be so
Now I know sorrow
The feeling comes and goes
We kiss like lovеrs
Like leaves in thе wind
Woo-oo-oh
Now and then, we don't pretend
Though she is but a child
And I'm just a friend
We drift on separate oceans
Let the breaker bend
Now I know sorrow
The feeling comes and goes
Yeah, I know sorrow
The feeling comes and goes
Comes and goes

Ba-ba-ba-la
Ba-ba-ba-la
Ba-ba-ba-la
Ba-ba-ba-la
Ba-ba-ba-la
