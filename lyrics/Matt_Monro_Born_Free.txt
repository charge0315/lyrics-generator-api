Born free
As free as the wind blows
As free as the grass grows
Born free to follow your heart

Live free
And beauty surrounds you
The world still astounds you
Each time you look at a star

Stay free
Where no walls divide you
You're free as a roaring tide
So, there's no need to hide

Born free
And life is worth living
But only worth living
'Cause you're born free

Stay free
Where no walls divide you
You're free as a roaring tide
So, there's no need to hide

Born free
And life is worth living
But only worth living
'Cause you're born free
