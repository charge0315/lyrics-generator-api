Oh yeah
Don't make me wait for you
Come on now
Don't be a fool, just think about it baby
Don't make me wait for you
Precious is my time, don't funk around it baby
Suppose our love goes round and round
Before you know it's settled down
Give me a reason to say "I do"
I'm tired of playing this game with you
Oh my god, I can't deny it
Almost fell in love with you
Thinking everything would be so cool
Oh la la, oh my god, I've got to fight it
I never wanna be with you
'Coz I never wanna face the truth
Don't make me wait for you
Don't be a fool, just think about it baby
Don't make me wait for you
Precious is my time, don't funk around it baby
I feel a fire within my soul
Confuse my body and take control
Why do you play me, I feel so cold
Just wanna please you, 'coz you're my one
Oh la la, oh my god, I can't deny it
Almost fell in love with you
Thinking eveything would be so cool
Oh la la, oh my god, I gotta fight it
Never wanna be with you 'coz I never wanna face the truth
Don't make me wait for you
Don't be a fool, just think about it baby
Don't make me wait for you
Precious is my time, don't funk around it baby
(Don't make me wait)
Don't make me wait for you, no
I'll be there for you
As I always do
I'll be there for you
'Coz your love is true
Don't make me wait for you
Don't be a fool, just think about it baby
Don't make me wait for you
Precious is my time, don't funk around it baby
(Don't make me wait for you)
Don't make me wait coz I'm dying for you
(Don't be a fool just think about it baby)
Give me your heart 'coz my love is so true
(Don't make me wait for you)
Don't make me wait coz I'm dying for you
(Precious is my time don't funk around it baby)
Give me your heart 'coz my love is so true
(Don't make me wait for you)
Don't make me wait for you
(Don't be a fool just think about it baby)
Don't make me wait
