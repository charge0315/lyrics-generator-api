Hands up if you wanna be loved
Hands up 'cos we wanna be loved
Walk me through it, I'll talk you through it
Blindfolded through the mine-field
Holler at me, I'll holler back, unflustered through the changes
Now put your hands up
Hands up if you wanna be loved
Hands up 'cos we wanna be loved
Hands up if you wanna be loved
Everybody sing yeah
Hands up if you wanna be loved
Hands up 'cos we wanna be loved
Hands up if you wanna feel love
It feels so right, to be reaching out for you
A feeling so good, when you're reaching out to me
We do what it takes, 'cos we wanna be loved
There's no denyin', we got it all ya'll
We got it all ya'll. We got it all ya'll. We've got it all
Glad you're back here, I gotcha back now
Intrusted, we got it pat down
Put it on me, I'll give it to you back
Upgraded to the top line
Hands up if you wanna be loved
Hands up 'cos we wanna feel love
Hands up if you wanna be loved
Let's get it on, get it on
