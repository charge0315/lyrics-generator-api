You never close your eyes anymore when I kiss your lips
And there's no tenderness like before in your fingertips
You're trying hard not to show it (baby)
But baby, baby I know it

You lost that lovin' feeling
Oh, that lovin' feeling
You lost that lovin' feeling
Now it's gone, gone, gone, woah-oh-oh

No there's no welcome look in your eyes when I reach for you
And girl, you're starting to criticize little things I do
Ooh, it makes me just feel like cryin' (baby)
'Cause baby, something beautiful's dying

You lost that lovin' feeling
Oh, that lovin' feeling
You lost that lovin' feeling
Now it's gone, gone, gone, woah-oh-oh

Baby, baby, I get down on my knees for you
(Get down on my knees)
If you would only love me like you used to do
(If you would only love me, love me)
We had a love, a love, a love you don't find everyday
(A love you don't find)
So don't, don't, don't let it slip away (Away)
I said, baby, baby, baby, baby
(I'm beggin' you, please) I'm beggin' you, please
I need your love (I need your love)
I need your love
So, bring it on back (Bring it on back)
Now bring it on back
Now bring it on back

You've got to bring back that lovin' feeling
Oh, that lovin' feeling
Bring back that lovin' feeling
'Cause it's gone, gone, gone
And I can't go on, woah-oh-oh

Bring back that lovin' feeling
Oh, that lovin' feeling
Bring back that lovin' feeling
'Cause it's gone, gone, gone

Bring back that lovin' feeling
Oh, that lovin' feeling
Bring back that lovin' feeling
'Cause it's gone, gone, gone

Bring back that lovin' feeling
Oh, that lovin' feeling
Bring back that lovin' feeling
'Cause it's gone, gone, gone
