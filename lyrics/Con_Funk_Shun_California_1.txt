L.A. nights ain't for sleeping
Carmel sights are for my fantasies
Redwoods reaching for the sky
And the Golden Gate lights are calling me
California 1
Highway of my memories
California 1
Spinning me toward my dreams
Western days are so easy
Pacific waves take me mind away
When the sun sets on the ocean
This is where I know I'm gonna stay
California 1
Highway of my memories
California 1
Spinning me toward my dreams
California 1
Highway of my memories
California 1
Spinning me toward my dreams
California 1
Highway of my memories
California 1
Spinning me toward my dreams
California 1
California 1
California 1
California 1
California 1
California 1
California 1
California 1
