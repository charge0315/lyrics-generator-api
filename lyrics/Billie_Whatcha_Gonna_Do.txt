Yeah
Thought you had me played huh? (Nah nah nah)
Well, check this out, yeah
See all those times
You thought you had me fooled, yeah?
You were wrong
'Cos I know
And this is for you (Whatchu say?)

This is for all the times you did me wrong
And all the lady friends you strung along
I don't ever want to see you cry
But I'm tired of your lies (what you say?)
This is for all the things you put me through
When Lord knows I gave my all to you
No more in and out my life
Now's the time I do things right

You can have
(You can have all your money)
(You can keep all your lies)
Keep all your lies
(You can take all of the games you played)
('Cos baby I'm saying bye bye)
(You can have all your money)
(You can keep all your lies)
Keep all your lies
(You can take all of the games you played)
('Cos baby I'm saying bye bye)

(Whatcha gonna do when)
(I'm over you and)
I wanna know baby
(Whatcha gonna do when)
(I'm over you and)
Oh I wanna know baby
(Whatcha gonna do when)
Whatcha gonna do when I'm gone

Now that I'm done trading things with you
I'm wondering who your friends are calling a fool
I must have been blind to let you in my life
Telling my friends I've found Mr Right
I'm so much stronger now that I've left you
You wouldn't believe the changes I've been through
It won't happen to me again I'd rather keep hanging
Out with my friends

You can have
(You can have all your money)
(You can keep all your lies)
Keep all your lies
(You can take all of the games you played)
('Cos baby I'm saying bye bye)
Baby I'm saying bye bye
(You can have all your money)
(You can keep all your lies)
Keep all your lies
(You can take all of the games you played)
('Cos baby I'm saying bye bye)

(Whatcha gonna do when)
Whatcha gonna do
(I'm over you and)
Tell me baby
(Whatcha gonna do)
Whatcha gonna do when I'm gone
(Whatcha gonna do when)
(I'm over you and)
Let me know
(Whatcha gonna do)
Whatcha gonna do

Oh I used to cry myself to sleep at night
Cos you never gave a damn about me
So many rumours I could write you a song
Oh how could you keep doing me wrong
Whatcha gonna do when I'm gone

Whatcha gonna do when
I'm over you and
Whatcha gonna do
Whatcha gonna do when
I'm over you and
Whatcha gonna do

Even though I hate to leave, boy
For I cry as I walk out the door
I'm saying bye bye
Bye bye, bye bye baby
Even though I hate to leave, boy
For I cry as I walk out the door
I'm saying bye bye
Bye bye, bye bye baby
Gone!
