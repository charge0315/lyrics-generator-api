I waited for so long outside myself
You see I was pretending to be someone else
I was longing to see who I wanted to be
And I've been waiting on my own
I've been waiting for too long
Not strong enough to be with you
And I've been making up my world
I've been painting it with gold
Not strong enough to see you, oh
I irrigate illusions then let them grow
How can I pacify myself and let go?
And I ran wild to see who I turned out to be
I've been waiting on my own
I've been waiting for too long
Not strong enough to be with you
And I've been making up my world
I've been painting it with gold
Not strong enough to see you
And I've been waiting on my own
I've been waiting for too long
Not strong enough to be with you
And I've been making up my world
I've been painting it with gold
Not strong enough to see you
I've been waiting on my own

But it was too cold in my world, my world
And I've been waiting on my own
I've been waiting for too long
Not strong enough to be with you
And I've been making up my world
I've been painting it with gold
Not strong enough to see you
See you, oh no
(Strong enough I'm not strong enough to see you)
See you
(Strong enough I'm not strong enough to see you)
(Strong enough I'm not strong enough to see you)
