Life used to be good
Now look what I’ve done
I've ruined my temple
With drugs, my mind is stunned

Cut down in my manhood
Before my time
Left in my darkness
I’ve lost my mind

I can't even think straight
Nobody knows what I say
Even my guitar
Wonders why I can’t play

No more a smile
I wear on my face
I've gone the last mile
And I’ve just lost the race

How did I get this way
It's so unreal
I'm no longer a person
I can’t even feel

Cut down in my manhood
Before my time
Left in my darkness
I've lost my mind
