Trains and boats and planes are passing by
They mean a trip to Paris or Rome
To someone else but not for me
The trains and boats and planes
Took you away, away from me
We were so in love, and high above
We had a star to wish upon wish
And dreams come true, but not for me
The trains and boats and planes
Took you away, away from me
Trains and boats and planes took you a way
But ev'ry time I see them I pray
And if my prayers can cross the sea
The trains and the boats and planes
Will bring you back, back home to me
