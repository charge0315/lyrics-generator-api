Well I'm ready... ready as anybody can be
I am ready... a ready as anybody can be
I'm ready for you
I hope you ready for me
Got an out of town pistol with the graveyard frame
It shoots tombstone bullets... wit da ball and chain
I'm drinkin' TNT... and smokin' dynamite
I hope some schoolboy starts a fight
'Cause I'm ready... ready as anybody can be
Well I'm ready for you... I hope you ready for me
All you pretty little chicks with'chor curly hair
I know you feel like I ain't nowhere
But stop what'chor doin' honey... come over here
I'll prove it to ya baby that I ain't no square
'Cause I'm ready... ready as anybody can be
Now I'm ready for you... I hope you ready for me
Well I been drinkin' gin like never before
I'm feelin' so good... that I want You to know
One more drink... honey I wish you would
Take a whole lotta lovin' to make me feel good
'Cause I'm ready... ready as anybody can be
As I'm ready for you... I hope you ready for...
Well I'm ready for you... I hope you ready for...
