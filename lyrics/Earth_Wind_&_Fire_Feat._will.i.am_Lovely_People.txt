Party people, let's get together, have a party
To all of my lovely people
Step to the floor and disco
We're playing your song so let's go
Come gather round, let's get down
Let your backbone slip so let loose
You know this funk is foolproof
Grab a cup of the soul juice
Come and gather round, let's get down
La, la, la, la, la, laaa, la, la, la
Lovely people, lovely people
La, la, la, la, la, laaa, la, la, la
Lovely people, lovely people
To all of my lovely people
Who really can't keep a tempo
Try this groove it's simple
Left right step let's get down
Gonna have a good time
Pay the negativity no mind
Get into it let your soul shine
Come on everybody let's get down
La, la, la, la, la, laaa, la, la, la
Lovely people, lovely people
La, la, la, la, la, laaa, la, la, la
Lovely people, lovely people
Let's have a party, call everybody, let's have a good time
Party people, let's get together, have a party
Jump up, freak or hustle
Do what you want, just move every muscle
Ain't no need for standin' around
There's only one thing to do when you hear that sound
And that's freak, freak, get a little louder
Then jump, jump
You know you really want to get down
With EWF, when the horn comes in you know you like that sound
