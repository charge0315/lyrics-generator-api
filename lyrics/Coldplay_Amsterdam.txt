Come on, oh, my star is fadin'
And I swerve out of control
And if I, oh, if I'd only waited
I'd not be stuck here in this hole

Come here, oh, my star is fadin'
And I swerve out of control
And I swear I waited and waited
I've got to get out of this hole

But time is on your side
It's on your side now
Not pushin' you down and all around
It's no cause for concern

(Ooh) Come on, oh, my star is fadin'
(Ooh) And I see no chance of release
(Ooh) And I know I'm dead on the surface
(Ooh) But I am screamin' underneath

And time is on your side
It's on your side now
Not pushin' you down and all around, oh
It's no cause for concern

Stuck on the end of this ball and chain
And I'm on my way back down again
Stood on a bridge, tied to a noose
Sick to the stomach
You can say what you mean, but it won't change a thing
I'm sick of the secrets
Stood on the edge, tied to the noose
And you came along and you cut me loose
You came along and you cut me loose
You came along and you cut me loose
