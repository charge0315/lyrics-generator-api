Hey Michael, come on and swing
Mm-hmm
Looks like you've got the world on a string

I've got the world on a string
I'm sitting on a rainbow
I've got that string around my finger
Oh, what a world, oh, what a life
I'm in love

I've got a song that I sing
And I can make the rainbow
Anytime I move my finger
Lucky me, can't you see I'm in love?

Life's a wonderful thing
As long as I've got that string
I'd be a silly so-and-so
If I should ever let you go

I've got the world on a string
I'm sitting on a rainbow
I got that string around my finger
Oh, what a world and what a life
I'm in love
Zee-zoot, zee-zoot, ze-zote, oh

Life is a wonderful thing
As long as I hold the string
I'd be a crazy so-and-so
If I should ever let her go

I've got the world on a string
I'm sitting on a rainbow
I got that string around my finger
Oh, what a world, oh, what a life
Oh, what a world, what a life
Oh, what a world, oh, what a life

'Cause I'm in love (He's in love, he's in love)
Mm, I'm in love (Got the world on a string)
And what a wonderful thing (All right)
When you get the world (Uh-huh)
On a string
