Whatever happened to the lives we had?
It was easy keeping people fed
But now they cry
There has to be a change
Whatever happened to the virgin land?
Now we're left with barely space to stand
The time has come
To open up our eyes
And if everyone
Simply learns from the things we've done
Before there's no place to run, you know

Every man wants to sleep at night
He wants to feel secure and
It's still the same for every man
Every man must be prepared to fight
Now that we understand it
Let's make it safe for every man

People standing in a welfare line
Don't they know it's a waste of time
They can't survive
Left hungry in the cold
How much longer can we make believe
That the air is really fit to breathe?
We can't sit by
And watch our futures fold
Have we lost our souls?
Are we digging a deeper hole?
Then it's time that we took control, you know

Every man wants to sleep at night
He wants to feel secure and
It's still the same for every man
Every man must be prepared to fight
Now that we understand it
Let's make it safe for every man

Every man wants to sleep at night
He wants to feel secure and
It's still the same for every man
Every man must be prepared to fight
Now that we understand it
Let's make it safe for every man
Every man wants to sleep at night
He wants to feel secure and
It's still the same for every man
Every man must be prepared to fight
Now that we understand it
Let's make it safe for every man
Ooh every man, ooh every man
Ooh every man, ooh every man
