When Jesus comes for me
I'll be waiting here watching patiently
With my eyes to the sky
My heart has confessed those things
That set men free and give them new life
The life I treasure now
Is a life filled with love and so much ecstasy
For God so loved the world
He gave His own, His only Son
That we shall have new life
He shed his blood for you and me
To cleanse us from all unrighteousness
All you have to do is open up your heart
And let Him dwell in you
And He'll show you His love
Give a place for Him to set up His kingdom
That's where life begins
That's where life begins
The kingdom is at hand
For those of you who have eyes to see, ears to hear
Let Him come on in
Open up your heart
Let His love shine in
And then you'll see your life begin before your eyes
Open up your heart
Give a place for Him to dwell in you
The truth begins His love inside
