Here in the twilight of one endless summer
You’ve got me waiting like a teenage girl
My eyes wide with starlight
But folded in my new dress, the memories
Love is more hesitant a second time

Oh oh
Hey, I won’t break your heart like you broke mine

This time around I won’t cling to those paper crowns
I won’t tear you down
This time I’ll listen like it’s love’s first secret
So come bring your love here with all its mistakes
Speak to me softly like lovers do
Here are the fragments I saved for you

Oh oh
Hey, I won’t break your heart like you broke mine

Oh, it seems it’s easy to love you
You go to my head just like wine
All the bitterness, it has left me
So don’t leave me standing here
I won’t be satisfied
Unless you come here and stay by my side

Oh oh oh, I won't break your heart
Oh oh oh, I won't break your heart
Oh it goes so fast
Oh oh oh, I won't break your heart
And it goes so fast
Oh oh oh, I won't break your heart
And it goes so fast
Oh oh oh, I won't break your heart
All that I know is that I love you
Oh oh oh, I won't break your heart
All that I know is that I want you
Oh oh oh, I won't break your heart
All that I know is that I need you
I won't break your heart
