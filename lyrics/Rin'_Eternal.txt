I heard you in my sleep again
Afraid of giving in
I'm damned

I am falling into you
Blood runs cold his curse insane
I am falling into you
And I try to get away
I am longing for someone
Who will join me in this ache
And I try to shut my mouth
Yeah Yeah

I felt you in my skin again
Grotesque and seething shame
Goddamn

Taste of me and let me know
Is it a sin to lose control?
And I have an appetite for suffering

I am falling into you
Blood runs cold his curse insane
I am falling into you
And I try to get away
I am longing for someone
Who will join me in this ache
And I try to shut my mouth
Yeah Yeah
