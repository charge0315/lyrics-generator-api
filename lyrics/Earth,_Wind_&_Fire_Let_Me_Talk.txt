Fifty million voices mumbling from the street
Talking 'bout the 80s and who it will mistreat
Now, Joseph Worken Hardy, checkin' out the jive
Glancing at his pocketbook, inflation is alive

I stand tall
Let me talk, let me talk
I stand tall
Let me talk, let me talk

Now, Miss Sophisticated, your nose up in the air
Trying to find excitement in the labels that you wear
Now, I may disappoint you with the things I say
But deep inside, a message burns within me everyday

I stand tall
Let me talk, let me talk
I stand tall
Let me talk, let me talk

We're all the same
With different names
Will you play your role
Just as you've been told?

Let me talk, let me talk
Let me talk, let me talk
I stand tall (Fifty million voices will say)
Let me talk, let me talk

Won't you come on down?
Put your feet on the ground
Get in touch with you
Let your love come through

World automotives chase the Arab wheel
Partnerships on nuclear, trying to make a deal
Now, what does it lead to?
I'm sure the question flows
Through many minds around the world
I'm sure nobody knows

Aye, aye, aye, aye, aye
Aye, aye, aye, aye, aye

I stand tall (Fifty million voices will say)
Let me talk, let me talk
I stand tall (Fifty million voices will say)
Let me talk, let me talk

Aye, aye, aye, aye
Aye, aye, aye, aye
I stand tall (Fifty million voices will say)
Let me talk, let me talk
