As I opened the door
I realized that you’re not here anymore
Your shoes on the floor
Used to annoy me but they don’t bother me like before
Cleaning up takes hours to do
Everything is reminding me of you
And I always yell bye before I go
Just to find out what I already know

And I don’t mind missing you
But I’d rather had you here
I wish you could see me now
I would hold you my dear

And although you’re not around
I still try to make you proud
You always brought out the best in me
I wish you could only see

I don’t mind missing you
But I’d rather had you here
I wish you could see mе now
I would hold you my dear
I don’t mind missing you
But I’d rather had you herе
I wish you could see me now
I would hold you my dear
