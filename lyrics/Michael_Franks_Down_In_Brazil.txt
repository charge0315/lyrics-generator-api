Down in Brazil
It takes a day to walk a mile
Time just stands still
And when the people you meet look at you they smile
They still believe in style
They soothe you with their sambas, 'til
You really know you're down in old Brazil
You can tell you're down in old Brazil
Down in Brazil
They never heard of win or lose
If you can't feel
Then all those café au lait girls in high heel shoes
Will really cure your blues
It seems they all just aim to please
Those women sway like wind in the banana trees
Then you know you're down in old Brazil
Down in Brazil
They know a million ways to play
You start to feel
And when you're happy
It's the same as when you pray
You'd think you get away
Then you know you never will
Now when you've been down in old Brazil
Now when you are down in old Brazil
Down in old Brazil
Down in old Brazil
Down in old Brazil
Down in old Brazil
