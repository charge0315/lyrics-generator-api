On a golden sky, you're my sparkle flying high
My vibrations start to rhyme in a chime
With love's direction
Now I'm traveling, my cares unraveling
Flying high, just you and me
Feeling free along love's highway
Love forever unfolds magical moments together
And the fire to ignite melodies tonight
Birds can only sing the songs we write
Harmonies in tune that reflect the moon
Sparkle, you're so rare and lovely in my sight
Just give me a sign, oh, and be my valentine
Let the arrows full of light pierce the night
With love's affection
Sharing blissfully, and making history
Fragrance of your loving smile
A little while will last forever
Love forever unfolds magical moments together
And the fire to ignite melodies tonight
Birds can only sing the songs we write
Harmonies in tune that reflect the moon
Sparkle, you're so rare and lovely in my sight
Harmonies in tune that reflect the moon
Sparkle, you're so rare and lovely in my sight
You're my valentine
You create a rhyme
All the birds can sing our song divine
Sparkle like a star, sparkling you are
Glistening in my heart
You light my sky
Fire to ignite melodies tonight
Birds can only sing the songs we write
Harmonies in tune that reflect the moon
Sparkle, you're so lovely in my sight
