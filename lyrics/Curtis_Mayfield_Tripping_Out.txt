I'm tripping out
I'm tripping out over you, babe - over you, babe
I'm tripping out
I'm tripping out over you babe, over you

Each day I'm not with you, is like a day without sunshine
I'm the whole of you, babe
You've become a part of me - ooh wee
You're not like other girls, or is it my imagination?
This pounding in my heart, girl, is all because of you\
You've got me

Tripping out, tripping out over you, babe
Over you, little mama
I'm tripping out, tripping out over you, babe
Over you, babe

Let me be your slave, because I've learnt to worship you
I'll do anything you say, anything you want me to
To me you are my queen, and I'm your knight in shining armour
Standing guard over your love, the love you've given me
You've got me

Tripping out, tripping out, over you, babe
I'm going crazy for you, mama
I'm tripping out, tripping out, tripping out, over you
Come on

Come on
Come on
It's a good feeling, ain't it, girl?
Come on
All over you, all over you, baby
Come on
Ooh wee, ooh wee, tripping out, tripping out
Come on

Each day I'm not with you, is like a day without sunshine
I'm hung up on your love
You've become a part of me
To me you are my queen, and I'm your knight in shining armour
Standing guard over your love, the love you've given me
You've got me

Tripping out, tripping out, over you, babe
You're so good to me, mama
Tripping out, tripping out, tripping out over you

I love you, baby
You're so good to me, little mama
Ooh wee, it's alright, it's alright
Tripping out
Ooh, trip on, it's alright, it's alright
Little fine pretty thing, tripped me out
She tripped me out
Got me all mixed up for you, baby
Every time I see you, every time I see you
And I hear you say "ooh wee", you trip me out
So sweet, so sweet, tripping me out
So sweet, tripping me out
So sweet, so sweet, so sweet, so sweet
Tripping me out
Tripping out, tripping out
Tripping out, tripping out all night long
