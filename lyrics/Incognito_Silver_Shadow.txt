Silver shadow
Silver shadow, a glowing shadow shining brightly for all to see
I remember gazing on this quiet night, the stars were bright as they could be
Wonderin' if things would ever go right and if there was a spot up there for me
Then one star got brighter by the minute
Strange that it seemed to have my name written in it
I reached for the star and it kissed me with its light
It made me cast a shadow that was silver and bright
Silver shadow, a glowing shadow shining brightly for all to see
I never had any real reason to thank my lucky stars
But now I've got a pretty good reason 'cause I know I'm gonna go far
I believe in magic, I really do
With all that's happened, it's got to be true
I cast a silver shadow from the kiss of the light
I knew that I was destined starting with tonight
Silver shadow, a glowing shadow shining brightly for all to see
Silver shadow, my future's shadow trying to tell me of the star I would be
Since I was chosen among the rest, I dedicate myself, I'm gonna be the very best
And my shadow forever silver will remain and the world will always remember my name
Silver shadow
A glowing shadow
Shining brightly
For all to see
Silver shadow, a glowing shadow shining brightly for all to see
Silver shadow, my future's shadow trying to tell me of the star I would be
Hey, yeah
Look at my shadow glow
Silver and wonderful sparkling thing
Look at my shadow glow
Think I'm gonna be a star
Look at my shadow glow
Glowin' so brightly, this wondrous thing
Look at my shadow glow
Look at my silver shadow
