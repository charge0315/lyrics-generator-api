Sweet young girl so soft and blonde
She does exactly as she's been warned
Intoxication's in her veins
Sweet young boy plays with her brain
Believing all his fake-filled lies
Putting his hands onto her thighs
Impurity has now been gripped
He takes away her innocence

The sweet children
Sweet children
Sweet children
We'll never win

Ooh, and Johnny Ray is running again
As he hits the floor again
Running from the light of day
Or maybe lie and celebrate
A sudden sign comes from his hands
Says, "Follow me if you understand"
He's got the trigger of his gun
The final sin, and now he runs

Sweet children
Sweet children
Sweet children
We'll never win

Ooh, sweet children
Sweet children
Sweet children
We'll never win
