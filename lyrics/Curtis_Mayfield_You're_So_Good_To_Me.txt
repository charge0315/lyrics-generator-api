Embracing me this way
Kiss my lips for taste
But oh, sweet ecstasy
Give it all up to me
(Give it all up, give it all up, give it all up)
Carry on our day this way
You're so good to me

Don't try to understand, too much after this
I wanna be the man
I know there is some risk
Oh, sock it to me, sock it to me
Ooh, you're so good to me

Don't wanna see selfishly, us brokenhearted
Should always be you for me and me for you
We too, loving through, hey baby
(Sexy dancing minx) Sexy dancing minx
(Sexy dancing minx)
You got just what it takes
(You got just what it takes)
And I hope it's not too late
(Hope it's not too late)
Want you tenderly
You're so good to me

So girl, I'm around
Friends, what are we for?
The way we have our fun
When we want to enjoy
Love me, love me now
You're so good to me

I could never get over you
(I could never, could never, could never)
No matter how I try
Hung up for your love, it's true
(Hung up for your love, hung up for your love)
Baby, that's my life
(Hung up for your love)
No one could satisfy
You're so good to me

I'm at a crazy pace
(Never get over, get over you)
Wanting you this way
(Never get over, get over you)
Blood begin to race
Whatever come what may
Love me tenderly
You're so good to me

(Never get over, get over you)
I can never get over, get over you
No matter what I try to do
Hung up on your love, it's true
I could never get over, get over you
You're so good to me
Hey baby, hey baby

Ooh, embracing me this way
Kiss my lips for the taste
But oh, sweet ecstasy
Give it all up to me
(Give it all up, give it all up, give it all up)
Get down, get down all day
'Cause you're so good to me

But never get over, get over you
No matter how I try
(Never get over, get over you)
Hung up on love, on love, it's true
(No matter what I try to do)
Baby, that's no lie
(Hung up on your love, it's true)
No one could satisfy
You're so good to me
You see, I could never get over you, get over you, get over you
'Cause you're so good to me
