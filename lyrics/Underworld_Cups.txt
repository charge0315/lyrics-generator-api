Bubble girl you feel like a movie
An' bubble blow bit faster
Liquid
An' bubble fish tank fast, slow
Fast, slow
An' bubble fast, slow down
The slope
Blue, blue
Blue, blue
Little girl
You chew gum, loud gum chew
Bubble blow bit faster
Bit faster, fish tank
An' bubble fast, slow down
Big slow
A bit faster
Everything's good
Drips heavy
Into liquid
Drips hard and thick
For something quick
Drips faster sometimes into my hand
False alarm
Fools imagine into slow back
Slow, and slow, and fast
Sneak up lights across the horizon
Sneak up last night in moonlight
Party crosses over the ocean
From left to right
Bubble blew you come back
You slow down
Bubble blow
Big faster
Big faster
Bubble fish tank fast, slow
Fast, slow
Ba ding, ba ding, ba ding
Drip slowdown
