Oh, that new day's coming soon
Oh, that new day's coming soon
Oh, how I wonder
It really makes me wonder
What's happened to all the plans that we made
Looks like they're all out of view
Oh and everyday life changes the set it rearranges
And all the players change their costumes
Well I know we need a brand new day
With what I see we need a new day
Well I know we've got to have a new day
And that new day's coming soon
Oh, how I wonder
It really makes me wonder, yeah
Where is so much of the beauty that we see?
Now I'm wondering if it's all been in a dream
Times, they go from bad to worse
Seems it's all been rehearsed
We were standing here acting out this scene
Well, I know we need a brand new day
From what I see we need a new day
I really do think we got to have a new day
And that new day's coming soon
Oh, how I wonder
It really makes me wonder
I know we've got to have a new day
I really do think we got to have a new day
From what I see we need a new day
And that new day's coming soon
Oh, how I wonder
It really makes me wonder, yeah
Well, from what I see we need a new day
With all the trouble in the world we need a new day
With all the lonely broken hearts are crying
All our loved ones are slowly, slowly dying
I know we need a new day
And that new day's coming soon
And that new day's coming soon (for me)
