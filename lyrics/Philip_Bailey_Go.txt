Thought I'd never see the day
When you'd up and walk way
Thought you'd try and stick it out
Now you're leaving, there's no doubt
Life is full of passion
Caviar and fashion
Go out and play
Hopes and dreams are in the past
We can't ever bring them back
What was once will never be
Time's run out for you and me
You'll find lots of takers
Instant moviemakers
Waiting for you
Go, for whatever reason
Go, it's the time and season
You have to do whatever's right
Oh, oh, go, for the fame and fortune
Go, if it's that important
You have to find it your own way
Hopes and dreams are in the past, uh huh
And we can't ever bring them back
What was once will never be, uh huh
Time's run out for you and me
You'll find lots of takers
Instant moviemakers
Waiting for you
Go, for whatever reason
Go, it's the time and season
You have to do whatever's right
