Out of the tree of life I just picked me a plum
You came along and everything started to hum
Still, it's a real good bet, the best is yet to come

The best is yet to come, babe, won't it be fine?
You think you've seen the sun, but you ain't seen it shine (Haha)

Wait 'til the warm-up's underway
Wait 'til our lips have met
Wait 'til you see that sunshine day
You ain't seen nothin' yet

The best is yet to come and, babe, won't it be fine?
The best is yet to come
The bеst is yet to come, come thе day you're mine

Come the day you're mine, I'm gonna teach you to fly
We've only tasted the wine
We're gonna drain the cup dry (Haha)
Haha

Wait 'til your charms are right for these arms to surround
Sho-do-ba-de-a-do-a-do, uh
You think you've flown before, but you ain't left the ground

Wait until you're locked in my embrace
Wait 'til I draw you near
Wait 'til you see that sunshine place
Ain't nothin' like it here

The best is yet to come, Tony, won't it be fine?
Diana, the best is yet to come, come the day you're mine
Go, you're mine

Wait 'til your charms are right for these arms to surround
You think you've flown before, but you ain't left the ground

Wait until you're locked in my embrace
Wait 'til I draw you near
Wait 'til you see that sunshine place
Ain't nothin' like it here

The best is yet to come, babe, won't it be fine?
The best is yet to come, come the day you're mine
Come the day you're mine, come the day you're mine
Come the day you're mine
