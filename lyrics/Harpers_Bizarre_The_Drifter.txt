Once again there's a feelin' inside of me
Nothin' new, I felt it before
Like a voice of hunger inside of me
Cryin' out "There's got to be more"

'Cause there's places that I've never been to
Sunsets to be ridden into
Not a lot I can do but give in to
The drifter (Drifter)
There's a drifter (Drifter)
In me

Though I've tried it I'm just not a settler
And nine to five don't make it with me
Why deny it?   It makes me feel better
To come alive and prove that I'm free

'Cause there's places that I've never been to
Sunsets to be ridden into
Not a lot I can do but give in to
The drifter (Drifter)
There's a drifter (Drifter)
In me

'Cause there's places that I've never been to
Sunsets to be ridden into
Not a lot I can do but give in to
The drifter (Drifter)
There's a drifter (Drifter)
In me
'Cause there's places that I've never been to
Sunsets to be ridden into
Not a lot I can do but give in to
The drifter (Drifter)
There's a drifter (Drifter)
In me
