Move over sun
And give me some sky
I've got me some wings
And I'm eager to try
I maybe unknown
But wait 'til I've flown
You're gonna' hear from me
Make me some room
You people up there
On top of the world
I'll meet you, I swear
I'm staking my claim
Remember my name
You're gonna' hear from me
Fortune smiled
On the road before me
I'm fortune's child
Listen world
You can't ignore me
I've gotta' song that longs to be played
Raise up my flag
Begin my parade
Then watch the world over
Start coming up clover
That's how it's gonna' be
You'll see
For you're gonna' hear from me
