Wooo!

It don't matter who you get with
'Cause it just ain't meant to be
It really don't matter
'Cause you never shoulda woulda
Ever coulda been like me
I can get you what you want
Anything at all, girl, all you got to say is "please"
Ask your mother, your sister, your brother
There will never be another
Never be another like me

Late afternoon slipped outta my bed
Turned up the stereo, about to raise the dead
Slipped in the bathroom, put some olive oil in my hair
Walked in the closet, trying to find something to wear
Then I check my email, see where the party be
Change the names to protect the guilty and get ready to creep
Should I bring somebody or dance alone?
It don't matter to me, y'all, 'cause tonight it's on, c'mon

It really don't matter who you get with
'Cause it just ain't meant to be
It really don't matter
'Cause you never shoulda woulda
Ever coulda been like me (Baby)
I can get you what you want
Anything at all, girl, all you got to say is "please"
Ask your mother, your sister, your brother
There will never be another
Never be another like me

'Bout a half past ten and I'm on my way
Heard you had a fine little Puerto Rican DJ
(Oh Mamacita)
Listen, if she ain't got Prince's new song, gonna be a scene
'Cause I can't stand nobody cussing at me when I'm clean
Arms all around me soon as I hit the door
Good thing I ate my spinach, you're thicker than before
Oh, what's this boy looking at? Why he making that face?
Don't he know I got crazy fools with me
Ready to tear up this place?

It really don't matter who you get with
'Cause it just ain't meant to be
(Be like Don Cornelius or Rick James)
It really don't matter
'Cause you never shoulda woulda
Ever coulda been like me
I can get you what you want
Anything at all, girl, all you got to say is "please" (oh Lord)
Ask your mother, your sister, your brother
There will never be another
Never be another like me

Can't you see this is inevitable?
What's the use in wasting time, mama?
You and me, we could be comfortable
All it takes is you to make up your mind

Uh, so now what's the matter, huh?
You and me, we both dimes, said we were
All them other pennies should scatter, said they should
We ought not waste this time, that's why

It really don't matter who you get with
'Cause it just ain't meant to be
It really don't matter (Yeah, yeah)
'Cause you never shoulda woulda
Ever coulda been like me
I can get you what you want
Anything at all, girl, all you got to say is "please"
(You gotta stop being average, it doesn't last)
Ask your mother, your sister, your brother
There will never be another
Never be another like me (What you waiting for?)

What you waiting for, what you waiting for?
(Never be another like me)
So what you thicker than before?
That's a'ight
(What you waiting for, what you waiting for?)
I like 'em healthy, baby, and what's more
(Never be another like me)
Let's get out on this dance floor
Whoo!

It really don't matter who you get with
'Cause it just ain't meant to be
Never be another, never be another like me
I can get you what you want
Anything at all, girl, all you got to say is "please"
Never be another, never be another like me
Never be another, never be another like me
Never be another like me
Never be another like me
Never be another, never be another like me

What you waiting for? What you waiting for?
What you waiting for? What you waiting for?
What you waiting for? What you waiting for?
What you waiting for? What you waiting for?
Never be another, never be another
Never be another, never be another like me
