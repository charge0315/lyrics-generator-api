Here we go again, infatuation touches me
Just when I thought that it would end
Oh, but then again it seems much more than that
But I'm not sure exactly what you're thinking

Well, I toss and turn all night thinking of your ways of affection
But to find that it's not different at all
Well, I throw away my past mistakes and contemplate my future
That's why I say, "What the hey?"

Would it last forever?
You and I together
Hand in hand, we run away (Far away)
I'm in for nasty weather
But I'll take whatever you can give that comes my way, yeah (Far away)
