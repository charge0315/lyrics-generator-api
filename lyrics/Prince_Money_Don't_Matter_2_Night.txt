One more card and it's 22
Unlucky for him again
He never had respect for money, it's true
That's why he never wins
That's why he never, ever has enough
To treat his lady right
He just pushes her away in a huff
And says, "Money don't matter tonight"

Money don't matter tonight
It sure didn't matter yesterday
Just when you think you've got more than enough
That's when it all up and flies away
That's when you find out that you're better off
Making sure your soul's alright
'Cause money didn't matter yesterday
And it sure don't matter tonight

"Look, here's a cool investment"
They're telling him he just can't lose
So he goes off and tries to find a partner
But all he finds are users (Users)
All he finds are snakes in every color
Every nationality and size
Seems like the only thing that he can do
Is just roll his eyes, and say that…

Money don't matter tonight (Don't matter)
It sure didn't matter yesterday
Just when you think you've got more than enough
That's when it all up and flies away
That's when you find out that you're better off
Making sure your soul's alright (Soul's alright)
'Cause money didn't matter yesterday (Don't matter)
And it sure don't matter tonight
(Ooh-wee-ooh, don't matter)
(And it don't matter tonight, no)
Doo-doo-doo

Hey, now, maybe we can find a good reason
To send a child off to war
So what if we're controllin' all the oil
Is it worth a child dying for? (Is it worth it?)
If long life is what we all live for
Then long life will come to pass
Anything is better than the picture of the child
In a cloud of gas
And you think you got it bad

Money don't matter tonight (No, don't matter)
It sure didn't matter yesterday (Yesterday, uh)
Just when you think you've got more than enough
That's when it all up and flies away (Flies away, flies away)
That's when you find out that you're better off
Making sure your soul's alright
(Making certain that your soul's alright)
'Cause money didn't matter yesterday
And it sure don't matter tonight
Money don't matter tonight
It sure didn't matter yesterday (Yesterday, yesterday)
Just when you think you've got more than enough
That's when it all up and flies away (Flies away, flies away)
That's when you find out that you're better off
Making sure your soul's alright
'Cause money didn't matter yesterday
And it sure don't matter tonight
