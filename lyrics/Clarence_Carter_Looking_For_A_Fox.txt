Ha, ha, ha, ha!
I'm all alone and fancy free
But this ain't the way I wanna be
Now girls, get your game up tight
We're gonna have a wing, ding doodle tonight
But right now
I'm looking for a fox
I'm looking for a fox
I'm looking for a fox
Tonight, the sky's the limit
I got some money and I wanna spend it
It's Saturday night and I wanna play
I'm gonna groove 'til the break of day
Now look-a here
I'm looking for a fox
I'm looking for a fox
I'm looking for a fox
Got a brand new pin-stripe suit of clothes
Big wide polka-dot tie
Cuff links as big as jay bird eggs
And look at that - shoes made out of alligator hide
Well, say something else here
I'm ripe and ready and hot to trot
(Boy, you on fire)
Girl, you can get everything I got
(Hell, take it too)
I got the money, girl, if you got the time
(We open all night)
All you gotta do is gimme a sign
Looky here
I'm looking for a fox
I'm looking for a fox
I'm looking for a fox
I'm looking for a fox
I'm looking for a fox
I'm looking for a fox
I'm looking for a fox
I'm looking for a fox
I'm looking for a fox
You know something, Mac? You can sing, man
Lookin' for a fox
Lookin' for a fox (I'm on fire)
Lookin' for a fox (Call out the dogs)
Lookin' for a fox (I hope you find one)
