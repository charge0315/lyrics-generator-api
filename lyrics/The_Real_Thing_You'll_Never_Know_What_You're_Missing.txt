I remember when we met
And you begged me not to get
Close to you
And you begged me not to get
Too involved with you and yet
I couldn't help myself
'Cause you had yourself a bad affair
With a boy who didn't care
And he hurt you love
Now you're afraid of love
Now you'll never know what you're missing
And I find myself just wishing
That you only could
So I tried constantly
To bring you close to me
How I tried?
But the more I get involved
Just had to become resolved
To living without you, girl
And though you really tried for me
It really wasn't hard to see
Somewhere deep within
That you belonged to him
Now you'll never know what you're missing
And I find myself just wishing
That you'd let me win
I tried, I tried my hardest
To get close to you
How I tried to satisfy?
But now you're gone
Hey, now you're gone
Oh, now you're gone
Now you're gone
And I find myself just wishing
That you only could
Now you'll never know what you're missing
And I find myself just wishing
That you only could...
