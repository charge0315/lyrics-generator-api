DA . KA . RA . SO . NO . TE . O . HA . NA . SHI . TE
No time to lose so get out of my way
Don't worry, I'm alright
I'll only let you down
I'm not the one that you really love
Whenever I feel so easy in my dreams
You knock on the door to break into my life without hesitation
Showing easy money before my eyes
All through the say you keep on hanging around me with your fake smile
Why do you do it to me again?
I made up my mind
I live the life I choose
Well, you know it ain't me, there should be a better way for you
(I don't wanna see you anymore)
DA . KA . RA . SO . NO . TE . O . HA . NA . SHI . TE
No time to lose so get out of my way
Don't worry, I'm alright
I'll only let you down
I'm not the one that you really love
HA . YA . KU . SO . NO . TE . O . HA . NA . SHI . TE
I've got to go so get out of my way
Don't worry, I'm alright
I'll never hide away
But I'm not the one that you really need
(Wanna be without you)
When there's something you don't know about me
You can't stand it and start to complain, mentioning the past
Where I'm going, with whom I had a date
Whole information, it's so idle, you gotta get 'em in your hands
Why do you do it to me again?
If you're gonna carry on, please tell me what you want
That's all I ask
So baby, leave me alone for just a while
(Hey, can you hear me? So please leave me alone for just a while)
DA . KA . RA . SO . NO . TE . O . HA . NA . SHI . TE

HA . YA . KU . SO . NO . TE . O . HA . NA . SHI . TE
I've got to go so get out of my way
