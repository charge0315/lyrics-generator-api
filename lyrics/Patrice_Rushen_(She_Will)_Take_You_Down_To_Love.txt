At the corner of your mind you'll find her
Waiting on the back street called control
If you listen she will show you the answer
Hidden in the longing of your soul

Can you find her?
She can steal your heart and take you down to love
If you find her
She will steal your heart and take you down to love

Just beneath the surface of your passion
You will find her whispering your name
She will tell love secrets for the askin'
And your life will never be the same

Do you feel her?
She will steal your heart and take you down to love
Do you feel her?
She will steal your heart and take you down to love

See the concrete melting at her power
She is sometimes naughty, but so nice
She will show you pleasures every hour
She won't deny desire has its price

Do you want her?
She can steal your heart and take you down to love
Do you want her?
She can steal your heart and take you down to love
Do you feel her?
Let her steal your heart and take you down to love
Just reveal her
And she'll steal your heart and take you down to love

Steal your heart and take you down, down, down, down, down to love
