She said "I love you boy I love you so"
She said "I love you baby oh, oh, oh, oh, oh"
She said "I love you more than words could say"
She said "I love you ba-ay-ay-ay-ay-by"

So I said what you're saying girl it can’t be right
How you can you be in love with me
We only just met tonight
But she said "But boy I loved you from the start"
When I first heard love goes down
Something started burning in my heart
I said "Stop this crazy talk"
"Leave right now and close the door" (she said…)

She said "I love you boy I love you so"
She said "I love you baby oh, oh, oh, oh, oh"
She said "I love you more than words could say"
She said "I love you ba-ay-ay-ay-ay-by"

So now I’m up in the courts pleading my case from the witness box
Telling the judge and the jury the same thing that I said to the cops
On the day that I got arrested, I’m innocent, I protested
She just feels rejected, had her heart broke by someone she obsessed with
Cos she likes the sound of my music
Which makes her a fan of my music
That’s why love goes down makes her lose it
'Cos she can't separate the man from the music
And I'm saying all this in the stand
While my girl cries tears in the gallery
This has got bigger then I ever could have planned
Like that song by the Zutons, Valerie
But the jury don’t look like they’re buying it
And this is making me nervous
Arms crossed, screw faced like I’m trying it
Their eyes fixed on me like a murderers
They wanna lock me up and throw away the key
They wanna send me down even though I told 'em she

She said "I love you boy I love you so"
She said "I love you baby oh oh oh oh"
(yes she did)
She said "I love you more than words can say"
She said "I love you ba-ay-ay-ay-ay-by"
So I said "Then why the hell you gotta treat me this way?"
You don’t know what love is
You wouldn’t do this if you did
Oh no, no, no, no
