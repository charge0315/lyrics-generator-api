She saw the look in his eyes
And she knew better
He wanted her tonight
And it was now or never
He made her feel so sad

Oh-woah-woah, Jamie's cryin'
Oh-woah-woah, Jamie's cryin'

Now Jamie wouldn't say all right
She knew he'd forget her
And so they said goodnight, oh
And now he's gone forever

She wants to send him a letter, uh-yeah, yeah
Uh, just to try to make herself feel better
It said, "Gimme, gimme a call sometime"
But she knows what that'll get her

Oh-woah-woah, Jamie's cryin'
Oh-woah-woah, Jamie's cryin'

Now Jamie's been in love before (Ahh)
And she knows what love is for (Ahh)
It should mean, a little, a little more (Ahh)
Than one-night stands
Woo

She wants to send him a letter, uh-yeah, yeah
Uh, just to try to make herself feel better
It said, "Gimme, gimme a call sometime"
But she knows what that'll get her

Oh-woah-woah, Jamie's cryin'

Oh-woah-woah, Jamie's cryin'
Oh-woah-woah, Jamie's cryin'
Oh-woah-woah, Jamie's cryin'
Oh-woah-woah, Jamie's cryin'
