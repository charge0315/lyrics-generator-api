Too many bottles of this wine we can't pronounce
Too many bowls of that green, no Lucky Charms
The maids come around too much
Parents ain't around enough
Too many joy rides in daddy's Jaguar
Too many white lies and white lines
Super rich kids with nothin' but loose ends
Super rich kids with nothin' but fake friends

Start my day up on the roof
There's nothing like this type of view
Point the clicker at the tube
I prefer expensive news
New car, new girl, new ice, new glass
New watch, good times, babe, it's good times, yeah
She wash my back three times a day (
Dyn-O-Mite
)
This shower head feels so amazin'
We'll both be high, the help don't stare
They just walk by, they must don't care
A million one, a million two
A hundred more will never do

Too many bottles of this wine we can't pronounce
Too many bowls of that green, no Lucky Charms
The maids come around too much
Parents ain't around enough
Too many joy rides in daddy's Jaguar
Too many white lies and white lines
Super rich kids with nothin' but loose ends
Super rich kids with nothin' but fake friends

Real love
I'm searchin' for a real love
Oh, real love
I'm searchin' for a real love
Oh, real love

Alright, close your eyes for what you can't imagine
We are the Xanny-gnashin', Caddy-smashin' bratty ass
He mad, he snatched his daddy's Jag and used the shit for batting practice
Adamant and he thrashin'
Purchasing crappy grams with half the hand of cash you handed
Panic and patch me up
Pappy done latch-keyed us
Toyin' with Raggy Anns, and mammy done had enough
Brash as fuck, breachin' all these aqueducts
Don't believe us, treat us like we can't erupt, yeah

We end our day up on the roof
I say I'll jump, I never do
But when I'm drunk, I act a fool
Talkin' 'bout, "Do they sew wings on tailored suits?"
I'm on that ledge, she grabs my arm
She slaps my head, it's good times, yeah
Sleeve rips off, I slip, I fall
The market's down like sixty stories
And some don't end the way they should
My silver spoon has fed me good
A million one, a million cash
Close my eyes and feel the crash

Too many bottles of this wine we can't pronounce
Too many bowls of that green, no Lucky Charms (Ah)
The maids come around too much
Parents ain't around enough (Uh-uh, uh)
Too many joy rides in daddy's Jaguar
Too many white lies and white lines
Super rich kids with nothin' but loose ends
Super rich kids with nothin' but fake friends

Real love (Ain't that somethin' rare?)
I'm searchin' for a real love (Talkin' 'bout real love)
Uh-oh, uh-oh (uh-oh)
Real love, real love, yeah
Real love (Real love)
I'm searchin' for a real love
Talkin' 'bout real love (Oh, ooh, ooh)

A fantastic product—
