Look-ee here girls I'm telling you now
They call me Lovin' Dan
I rock'em, roll'em all night long
I'm a sixty minute man!
If your man ain't treatin' you right
Come on and take my hand
When I let you go you'll cry
"Oh yes, he's a sixty minute man!"
If you don't believe I'm all I say
Come up and take my hand
When I let you go you'll cry
"Oh yes, he's a sixty minute man!"
