Everybody likes Billy's Barbeque
Everybody likes Billy's Bally-Hoo
You have to come tonight
For a booze and a bite
Or just to say "Hello there" and "Howdy-doo"
Come along with me, it is so much sun
Billy's Barbeque is number one
Let sorrow be yesterday
Tomorrow is far away
We borrow some happiness today
Everybody likes Billy's Barbeque
Everybody likes Billy's Bally-Hoo
You have to come tonight
For a booze and a bite
Or just to say "Hello there" and "Howdy-doo"
You cannot slay away
'Cause the band will play
Everybody likes Billy's Barbeque
Did you ever see such a crazy man
Did you ever see such a lazy man
That's Billy, in school he looked so silly
But now he's worth a million and maybe even more
Everybody likes Billy's Barbeque
Everybody likes Billy's Bally-Hoo
You have to come tonight
For a booze and a bite
Or just to say "Hello there" and "Howdy-doo"
