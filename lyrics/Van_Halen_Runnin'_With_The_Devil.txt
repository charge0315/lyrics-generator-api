Yeah, yeah, yeah
Ah, yeah

I live my life like there's no tomorrow
And all I've got I had to steal
Least I don't need to beg or borrow
Yes, I'm livin' at a pace that kills
Ooh, yeah

(Runnin' with the devil)
Ah, ah-ha, yeah, woo-hoo-ooh
(Runnin' with the devil)
I'll tell ya all about it

I found the simple life ain't so simple
When I jumped out on that road
I got no love, no love you'd call real
Ain't got nobody waitin' at home

Ah, yeah
(Runnin' with the devil)
Goddamn it, lady, you know I ain't lying to ya
I'm only gonna tell you one time, ah, yeah
(Runnin' with the devil)
Yes, I am, yeah

Woo!
Woo!

You know, I found the simple life weren't so simple, no
When I jumped out on that road
Got no love, no love you'd call real
Got nobody waiting at home

Ah, yeah
(Runnin' with the devil)
Oh, God, oh, God, I'm running, oh, yeah
(Runnin' with the devil)
Uh, uh, one more time

Woo!

(Runnin' with the devil)
(Runnin' with the devil)
(Runnin' with the devil)
(Runnin' with the devil)
