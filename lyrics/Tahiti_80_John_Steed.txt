When you're dressed in leather
I could be John Steed forever
And even when, the sun is not here
You come home (?) like a cup of coffee
And, you, you don't know what you do
But you're always doing well
And even if I've got your picture
In my left shoe
That doesn't help me
And when the sun is out
I come home white as snow
And when I'm dressed in leather
I look like the bloke from the Village People
And you, you don't know what to do
But you're always doing well...
And even if I've got your picture
In my left shoe
That doesn't help
No, that doesn't help me that much
That doesn't help me at all
