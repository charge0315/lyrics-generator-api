You can have it if you really want
You can grab it if you have the thought
Feel your power that is deep within
Are you ready? On your mark, begin

We should take time out to really love
We should find out who we really are
We should take time out to really love

Do you feel this life's a big mistake?
Don't you hate the way it's all so fake?
All I wanna do is just be real
And get off of the spinning wheel
All they sell us is a sack of lies
And we're buying one in every size
Can't you see it in the children's eyes?
It's about to get wild

We should take time out to really love
We should find out who we really are
We should take time out to really love (Ah, hey)
We should take time out to really love
We should find out who we really are
We should take time out to really love

We should take time out to really love
We should find out who we really are
You can have it any way you want it
You can have it any way you want it (Ah)
We should take time out to really love
We should find out who we really are
You can have it any way you want it
You can have it any way you want it
(Ayy, hey, you should take the time)
We should take time out to really love
We should find out who we really are
You can have it any way you want it (Any way you want it)
You can have it any way you want it (Hey, hey)
We should take time out to really love
We should find out who we really are
You can have it any way you want it (Any way you want it)
You can have it any way you want it (Hey, hey, ooh)
We should take time out to really love
We should find out who we really are
You can have it any way you want it
You can have it any way you want it
We should take time out to really love
We should find out who we really are
