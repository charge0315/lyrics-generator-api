Right right; right right
Right right; right right

It's a celebration, baby, step out with me
Draped in your finest clothes and accessories
I notice you've been focused on the stress of the week
But it's Friday tonight, spend the night out with me

Let's hit the party tonight
That would be out of sight
No matter where we decide, it's gon' be on tonight
You're looking ready and right
You sure be out of sight
We're coming home late tonight
We gonna do it right right
We'll do it right right
Our hands are sky-high
From left to the right
Don't look at the time
Just let it fly by
We live the good life
And we do it right right
We do it right right

Ain't too fast or slow, it's just enough to get down
Might be from the country but we're going to town
This weekend we can freak it, leave it all on the floor
First get low, then come close
Let the music control, oh

Let's hit the party tonight
That would be out of sight
No matter where we decide, it's gon' be on tonight
You're looking ready and right
You sure be out of sight
We're coming home late tonight
We gonna do it right right
We'll do it right right
Our hands are sky-high
From left to the right
Don't look at the time
Just let it fly by
We live the good life
And we do it right right
We do it right right

This is the last call
Fill up your glass, y'all
We'll dance until they play the last song
It's the end of the night
Now it's just you and I
It's time for us to take this party back home

Let's hit the party tonight
That would be out of sight
No matter where we decide, it's gon' be on tonight
You're looking ready and right
You sure be out of sight
When we go home late tonight
Girl, we gon' do it right right
Until the daylight
We'll do it right right
Yes, we'll do it all night
Don't look at the time
Just let it fly by
Yes, we live the good life
And we do it right right
Then we say bye-bye

Then we say bye-bye (Bye-bye)
Bye-bye (Bye-bye)
Bye-bye (Bye-bye)
Bye-bye (Bye-bye)
Hey, good night
