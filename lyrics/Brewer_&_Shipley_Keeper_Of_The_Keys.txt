Could we possibly see the keeper of all the keys
One key to rule them he keeps in the great hall
Under the dark tower, we call

Now we beat on the drum
Aquarian dancers come
And now the children the oracle has seen
Play at the old gates of his dreams
And he doesn’t even realize
He doesn’t realize
That it’s all happening
To let him know there’s a changе comin’ up behind him
But he's hanging on to the chains and thе key that binds him

Now the changes are there
And the color of renaissance fair
Sings ‘neath the window and lies on a new breeze soft
For the old keeper of keys
And he doesn’t even realize
He doesn’t realize
That it’s all happening
To let him know there’s a change comin’ up behind him
But he’s hanging on to the chains and the key that binds him

Keeper of the keys
Keeper of the keys
He’s the keeper of the keys
But it’s almost over now
