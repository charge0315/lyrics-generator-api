My, my, my, my ship is coming in
And you're the only thing that ain't on it
My mama's ship is docking now
But I don't see you waving from the bow, no, how?
Well, I got myself a steady job
And I'm earning everybody's respect
Moving up (Higher up)
There's a future that I've got to protect, wooh-ooh
I've been saving every penny I can (That I can)
And I'm working on a family plan
But it won't be complete 'till I'm reaching for your family hand
I keep on trying to tell you, girl
My, my, my, my ship is coming in
And you're the only thing that ain't on it
My mama's ship is docking now
But I don't see you waving from the bow, no, how?
Oooh
I've got everything I need but you
What's a man in my position to do?
Gotta home that was built and designed for occupation by two, brand new
I can listen to my stereo (Play it loud)
I can drive my car where I want to go (Anywhere, anywhere)
But material things can be bought if you've got money to blow
(No) But money won't buy devotion
My, my, my, my ship is coming in
And you're the only thing that ain't on it
My mama's ship is docking now
But I don't see you waving from the bow, no, how?
No, how?
I'm getting much closer to you (Getting much closer)
You're where I want to be
(Can't you see I'm changing?)
But all this fantasy
(Baby, without you)
Is only making me sad and lonely
So sad, so sad, so sad and lonely
My, my, my, my ship, my ship is coming in
And you're the only thing that ain't on it
My mama's ship is docking now
But I don't see you waving from the bow, no, how?
My, my, my, my ship is coming in
And you're the only thing that ain't on it
My mama's ship is docking now
But I don't see you waving from the bow, no, how?
