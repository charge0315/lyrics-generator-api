In love we live
In love you breathe
If love you give
Then love received
And love's amazing
When it's love you find
It moves you inside
Helps you grow
Heals the pain
If you trust your heart
You can make a change
Got no choice about it
'Cause the fact remains
Etched in stone (Love is what we need, yeah)
In our thoughts (Love is what we need)
Love is light (Love is what we need, yeah)
Guide us all (Love is what we need, love)
And it ain't change (Love is what we need, yeah)
Love is law (Love is what we need)
Love is right (Love is what we need, yeah)
We need love, love (Love is what we need, love)
Holds the ocean
Brings the rain
You'll remember
What you need within
Keeps you safe
Makes me dream of you
Can't go wrong
Let love surround us
Don't it feel so good?
Love's a feelin'
It's understood
Keep believin' and love endures
Etched in stone (Oh, oh, love is what we need)
In our thoughts (Love is what we need, yeah)
Love is light (Love is what we need, yeah)
Guide us all (Love is what we need, love)
And it ain't change (Love is what we need, yeah)
Love is law (Love is what we need)
Love is right (Love is what we need, yeah)
We need love, love (Love is what we need, love)
