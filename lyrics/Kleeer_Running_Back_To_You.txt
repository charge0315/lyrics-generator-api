Running back to you
Running back to you
Running back to you
Running back to you

Greener pastures took my love away from you
Anything was my excuse, now there's egg upon my face
It was disaster, the minute I became aware
That no other could compare
Hey, did somebody take my place?

Baby, take me back and I'll be running
(Running back to you)
Hey baby, hey baby, hey baby
(Running back to you)
I'm so sorry that I left you, honey
(Running back to you)
Let's get back together, baby, hey baby
(Running back to you)

Honey, what's my fate?
Don't say I'm too late
Darling, will you please
Have mercy on me
I'm so sorry

Try me again, babe
I know I'm the one to blame
Now I have only one aim
And that is to get you back
I committed a sin, babe
Ooh, I made a big mistake
And any price I'd gladly pay
Believe me, and that's a fact

Baby, take me back and I'll be running
(Running back to you)
Forgive me, forgive me, forgive me baby
(Running back to you)
I'm so sorry that I left you, honey
I'm so sorry, sorry, baby, hey-ey, hey...
(Running back to you)
Woo-hoo, hoo...
(Running back to you)

Running back to you
Running back to you
Running back to you
Running back to you
Running back to you
Running back to you
Running back to you
Running back to you
Running back to you
Running back to you
Running back to you
Running back to you

Take me back, baby
(Running back to you, running back to you)
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry
(Running back to you, running back to you)
I made a big mistake baby, I made a big mistake mama
(Running back to you, running back to you)
I want you, I want you, woo...
(Running back to you, running back to you)
I love you, I want you, huh!
(Running back to you, running back to you)
Forgive me, forgive me baby
(Running back to you, running back to you)
Forgive me baby, forgive me baby
(Running back to you, running back to you)
Forgive me baby, forgive me baby
(Running back to you, running back to you)
Oh honey, oh honey
(Running back to you, running back to you)
Forgive me, forgive me
(Running back to you, running back to you)
Forgive me, forgive me
(Running back to you, running back to you)
Forgive me, forgive me
(Running back to you, running back to you)
Forgive me, forgive me...
(Running back to you, running back to you...)
