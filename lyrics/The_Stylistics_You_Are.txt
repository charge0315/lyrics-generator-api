You are the kind of a girl
I wanna take home to meet my family
You are the kind of a girl
I wanna be proud for all the world to see
You are just exactly what I've always tried to find
When the thought of having kids, draws pictures on my mind
Yes, you are the kind of a girl, baby
I wanna love the rest of my life
A rainbow in the sky is what you are
A piece of apple pie is what you are
A valentine is what you are, girl
You are the kind of a girl
I wanna take home to meet my family
You are the kind of a girl
I wanna be proud for all the world to see
You are just exactly what I've always tried to find
When the thought of having kids, draws pictures on my mind
Yes, you are the kind of a girl, baby
I wanna love the rest of my life
A rainbow in the sky is what you are
A piece of apple pie is what you are
A valentine is what you are, girl
