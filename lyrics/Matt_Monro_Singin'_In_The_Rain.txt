I'm singin' in the rain, just singin' in the rain
What a glorious feeling I'm happy again
I'm laughing at clouds so dark above
The sun's in my heart and I'm ready for love
Let the stormy clouds chase everyone from the place
Come on with the rain, I've a smile on my face
I'll walk down the lane with a happy refrain
And singin', just singin' in the rain

Let the stormy clouds chase everyone from the place
Come on with the rain, I've a smile on my face
Well I'll walk down the lane with a hap-hap-happy refrain
I'm singin', just singin' in the rain
