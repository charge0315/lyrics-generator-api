It's over now you've had your fun
Get up them stairs go on quickly
Don't run
Take off your shoes the both of you's
Leave them down outside the door
Turn the landing light off
No wait, leave it on
It might make the night
That much easier to be gone
And in the morning who'll be wide awake
And eating snowflakes
As opposed to those flakes
We will, we will
That afternoon we spent the day
With uncle Frank and his wife auntie Mae
Well do you know since then
I've received up to four letters
All of which repeat the same
They say thrilled to bits
Can't believe you came
We've relived it both
Over time and time again
And if there's even a chance
Or even half you might be our way
Would you promise to stay
We will, we will
Oh it's not easy pretending that you cannot hear
Once you've suffered the affliction within
It's no use in an ending to proclaim from the start
That the moral of the story's to begin
On Sunday next if the weather holds
We'll have that game
But I bagsy-being-in-goal
Not because I'm good
Or because I think I should
It's just that well at my age
I think standing still
Would really suit me best
Do we all agree?
Hands up those who do
Hands up those who don't
I see well in that case
Will we please be kind enough
If not on Sunday
To go to mass on Monday
We will, we will, we will
