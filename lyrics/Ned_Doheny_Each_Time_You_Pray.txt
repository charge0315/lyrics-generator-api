What can you do?
When all you go is fro and to?
Each time you pray
If only love would find a way
It's lost in the telling
Yet it must be told
Before the moment flies, while heaven upholds you
And devotion lights your eyes
What can I do
When all I know is loving you?
What can I say? (What can I say?)
I'll wonder 'til my dying day
It's shadow and substance
It's the way you feel (It's the way you feel)
The need for love behooves, you don't have to shout it
I can read between the grooves
What can you do?
Now all you go is fro and to
What can you say? Hey (What can you say? Hey)
It's fine until it slips away
What can you do? (What can you do? What can you do?)
(What can you do? What can you do?)
(What can you do? What can you do?)
(What can you do? What can you do?)
Do what you do (Do it, do it)
All you go is fro and to (Do it, do it)
Each time you pray (Do it, do it)
If only love would find a way (Do it, do it)
Do what you do, do what you do (Do what you do, do what you do)
All I know is loving you (Do what you do, do what you do)
Woah (Do what you do, do what you do)
Yeah, yeah, yeah (Do what you do, do what you do)
