What the world needs now is love sweet love
It*s the only thing that there*s just too little of
What the world needs now is love sweet love
No not just for some but for everyone
Lord we don*t need another mountain
There are mountains and hillsides enough to climb
There are oceans and rivers enough to cross
Enough to last until the end of time
What the world needs now is love sweet love
It*s the only thing that theres just too little of
What the world needs now is love sweet love
No not just for some but for everyone
Lord, we dont need another meadow
There are corn fields and wheat fields enough to grow
There are sunbeams and moonbeams enough to shine
Oh listen Lord, if you want to know
What the world needs now is love sweet love
Its the only thing that theres just too little of
What the world needs now is love sweet love
No not just for some, oh but just for every every everyone
What the world (whoa whoa) needs now
Is love (is love) sweet love
What the world ( oh oh) needs now
Is love (is love) sweet love
What the world (whoa whoa) needs now
Is love (is love) sweet love
