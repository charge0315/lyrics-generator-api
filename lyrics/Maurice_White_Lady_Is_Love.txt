Oh my, the lady is love
Her heartlight touches me with love
Every night she keeps my faith in love
Oh my, the lady is love
The sweetest song I ever heard
It's the song she sings inside my world
She's my heart and soul that overflows forever
Reaching endlessly into my dreams
(And I gotta say)
Oh my, the lady is love
Her heartlight blesses me with love
All night the lady lifts me up
Oh my, the lady is love
Precious pearl, once a girl, now a lady
With a gentle smile she moves my world
Like nature's child, free and wild, and I love it
On this special night I know she's mine
The light in you takes my breath away
Oh I can feel it
Love gave a reason every way
I want to give my heart to you
Oh my, the lady is love
Her heartlight touches me with love
Every night she keeps my faith in love
Oh my, the lady is love
The lady is love
Every night she will be my love
Oh my, the lady is love
You are my heartlight
The light in your heart baby
Takes my breath away
The light in your heart baby
Oh the light in your heart
Oh send a light to my heart baby
Take my breath away
