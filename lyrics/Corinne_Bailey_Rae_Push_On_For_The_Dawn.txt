Sometimes when I close my eyes
I see your face and I see mine
Warm as the sun
I don’t know if I’m waking or sleeping
I don’t know if I’m thinking or dreaming
I just follow the sun
Sometimes when I’m in the dark
The thought of you is a tiny spark
Keeps me walking in the dark
Push on for the dawn
The night is silent
But dawn comes blazing in
It blooms like a flower
It burns to the heart of me
And everyday is our adventure
Keep pushing on
For everyday I want to thank you
You’re pushing me on
'cause you bring me joy
Everyday is a new beginning
Everyday is a chance to start again
Till time descends like a curtain, calling: “It’s the end”
Sometimes when the pain is gone
We move really slow just to carry on
You can go ahead if you want to
But I’ll be a river
My head in the mountains
My feet on the shore
Midnight when the lake is black
The moon and stars are reflected back
Into the night sky
So is my life, Lord
Reflected back to you
The life that was never mine
A move on the water
A whisper into the night
Everyday is our adventure
Keep pushing on
For everyday I want to thank you
You’re pushing me on
'cause you bring me joy
Everyday is a new beginning
Everyday is a chance to start again
Till time descends like a curtain calling: “It’s the end”
When love unveils its heart and shows you it is friend
When all I want to do is be dancing again
Keep pushing on
