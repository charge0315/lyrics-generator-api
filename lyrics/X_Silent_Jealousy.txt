I'm looking for you
Trying to reach your roses
Carried away by the time
Seijaku no kyouki ni katame o
Tsubusareta mama
You've gone away
From the stage
Leaving no words
There's just fake tears left
Itsuwari no shinju de kazatta
Bara no hanataba o sagasu
I'm blind insane
In the red of silence
Now I've lost your love
Genkaku no ai ni kawareta ayatsuri ningyo
Get me on my feet
Get me back to myself
Pretend you love me
Yubisaki made shinku ni somatta
Ore o mitsumete
Mou taekirenai kodoku no serenade
Kyozou no umi ni nagashite
Yume kara sameta chimamire no tenshi o
Mune ni daitemo
I can not stop
Silent Jealousy
Don't you leave me alone
Kanashimi ni midarete
Modorenai ai o kazaru
Kurikaesu kodoku no naka ni
Tell me true doko ni yukeba
Kurushimi o aiseru
I still want your love ai o tomete
Kurui saku kioku o keshite
"I just wanted to stay with you
I just wanted to feel your breath of grace
I didn't know what to do
I couldn't say anything
When consciousness returned
Everything had been washed away
By the tide of time, even you
But the scars of memory never fade away
I can't stop loving you
Stop my tears
Stop my loving
Kill my memories"
You dyed my heart in blood
No way to kill my sadness
Tachisaru mae ni koroshite
Kyouki no ai ni dakareta hitomi wa
Nani mo mienai
Ima mo I miss you
Can't live without you
Silent Jealousy yume ni ochite
Dakishimeru kioku o
Stay in yesterday toki o tomete
Kurikaesu kodoku o keshite
Take me back to the memory, to the dream
Silent Jealousy
Don't you leave me alone
Kanashimi ni midarete
Kill me, Love
