Oh yeah...
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah...
Here we are in a room full of broken hearts
Lovers once
But in the end
We never really had a chance
You wanted to be free
Now that your lonely
You want me back again
Ah-ah-ah...
But I'm not gonna be the one that you call
Not gonna take the fall
For all the your indecision
I'm not gonna put my back to the wall
I'm not gonna take the fall
For all the pain you've given
Me and you
We were a dream
That never could come true
In time you'll see
That our love
Was never really meant to be
And if you discover
You need a lover
Someone to break your fall
Well, I'm not gonna be the one that you call
Not gonna take the fall
For all your indecision
I'm not gonna put my back to the wall
Not gonna take the fall
For all the pain you've given
Ay-ah-yi
Yaddah-yi
Yaddah-yi-yi-yi...
Ay-ah-yi
Yaddah-yi
Yaddah-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi
Oh, you wanted to be free
Now that your lonely
You want me after all
Oh-oh-oh...
But I'm not gonna be the one that you call
Not gonna take the fall for all your indecision
Not gonna put my back to the wall
Oh-oh-oh...
Not gonna take the fall
For all the pain you've given me
Not gonna be the one that you call
Not gonna take the fall...
Not gonna put my back to the wall
Not gonna take the fall...
