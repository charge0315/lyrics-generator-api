Love, it was meant to be played by the rules
Guess that I'm just like all the other fools
'Cause if you said the words
I would make believe they're true

Darlin' say the words I want to hear
Say the words and I won't mind
Even though they may be only words

Lies, girl I can't hear enough of those lies
So if love's only meant for the wise
One more lie for a fool
Shouldn't matter much to you, oh no
Though it may seem incomplete
I'll pretend not to know it
Maybe love is obsolete
There's no one who will see
Keep on lying to me

Darlin' say the words I want to hear
Say the words and I won't mind
Even though they may be only words

Darlin' say the words I want to hear
Say the words and I won't mind
Even though they may be only words
