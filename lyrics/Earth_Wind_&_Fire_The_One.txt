They expect for you to make their dreams come true
Just keep doin' what you do
Don't let them change you
Just stay honest and true
'Cause if they knew what you knew
It's so hard to be the one, the one, the one, the one
They expect for you to make their dreams come true
Just keep doin' what you do
Don't let them change you
Just stay honest and true
'Cause if they knew what you knew
It's so hard to be the one, the one, the one, the one
Many have tried it
But you are that walking testimony
That makes me believe
To trust not in what I hear
And re-think all I've seen
That was the first time I opened my eyes, baby
(The first time I just opened my eyes)
I've seem to fallen
(I've seem to fallen)
I know I give so much more than what they expect of me
Is it fear that your opponent
Could very well be me?
And you will be second now
Ain't it hard to stay on top?
They expect for you to make their dreams come true
Just keep doin' what you do
Don't let them change you
Just stay honest and true
'Cause if they knew what you knew
It's so hard to be the one, the one, the one, the one
They expect for you to make their dreams come true
Just keep doin' what you do
Don't let them change you
Just stay honest and true
'Cause if they knew what you knew
It's so hard to be the one, the one, the one, the one
Searchin', you found it, you climbed it
Was that mountain everything you thought it would be?
No matter how far you go, girl
You'll come right back to me
Ain't life funny, baby?
Well, believe it (just keep believin' it)
And achieve it (just keep achievin' it)
Keep on dreamin'
Look at everything with innocence just like a child
Keep your head up, let no one make you frown
Gotta keep smilin', baby (keep on risin' to the top)
They expect for you to make their dreams come true
Just keep doin' what you do
Don't let them change you
Just stay honest and true
'Cause if they knew what you knew
It's so hard to be the one, the one, the one, the one
They expect for you to make their dreams come true
Just keep doin' what you do
Don't let them change you
Just stay honest and true
'Cause if they knew what you knew
It's so hard to be the one, the one, the one, the one
