You say that everything is over
I say that we can find a way
I'm here and you can think it over
I'll keep waiting, I'll keep waiting
I say there must be a solution
Some way that we can both agree
Why should it take a revolution
Just for you to talk to me?
And it all comes down to what you think
Because one mind changes everything

And I believe
That breathing makes you free
And I believe
That love's our destiny
And I believe
In things I cannot see
Like faith and joy and peace and hope
And harmony

In my world we really aren't different
In your world we'll never be the same
I speak but you don't want to listen
It's easier to walk away
Slow down, wait another minute
Just once, let there be no blame
My world will always have you in it
That's one thing that time won't change
And you got to take that first hard step
There is a place and we're just not there yet

And I believe
That breathing makes you free
And I believe
That love's our destiny
And I believe
In things I cannot see
Like faith and joy and peace and hope
And harmony

All one, under the same stars
Born by the same son
Harmony
When will I be finally free?

And I believe
That breathing makes you free
And I believe
That love's our destiny
And I believe
In things I cannot see
Like faith and joy and peace and hope
And harmony
And I believe
That breathing makes you free
And I believe
That love's our destiny
And I believe
In things I cannot see
Like faith and joy and peace and hope
Peace and hope, peace and hope
Like faith and joy and peace and hope
And harmony
Oh, yeah, yeah
Peace and harmony
