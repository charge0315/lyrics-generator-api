Tell me what can I do with it
Tell me what can I do with it
Tell me what can I do with it
Tell me what can I do with it
It started when I was young
Tell me what can I do with it
Then stopped for a while
Tell me what can I do with it
Baby, baby it's not a crime
Baby, baby it's not a crime
Baby, baby it's not a crime
Baby, baby it's not a crime
It's always a different story, you know?
So weird, so weird
This place doesn't look
Like anything else
You hold me for a little
If you stay in the middle
Learn the lesson of time
For once in your life
You should say the things you like
Learn the lesson of time
Welcome to paradise
Welcome to paradise
Welcome to paradise
Welcome to paradise
Welcome to paradise
Welcome to paradise
Welcome to paradise
Welcome to paradise
Welcome to paradise
Welcome to paradise
Welcome to paradise
Welcome to paradise
The lesson of time
The lesson of time
The lesson of life
