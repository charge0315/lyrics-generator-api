Shame, dog shame
I know what's wrong
Man's too old and wise
Bring in the dog, turn on
Down the mountain rescue
Slip and slide when sunny
Small cat better move along
Or this bitch could do some harm, baby
Straight as an arrow
I'm walking the dog

Three's a crowd
Two's a dog and me playing
What's he saying?
Free as a cloud, no one ever really knew you
Make clear your illusion no, no, no, no

Some dreams you dream you alone
You thank Christ you're coming home
You better, better give the dog a bone
Go, go, go, go, chew, chew, chew, chew
Some dreams you dream alone
Go get a life and ease the pain
Dog's a best friend's dog
Dog's a best friend's dog

Word, speech, blurred, bleached
Tell Mr. Godot I'm walking the dog
Walking the dog

Some dreams you dream you alone
You thank Christ you're coming home
You better, better give the dog a bone
Go, go, go, go, chew, chew, chew, chew
Some dreams you dream alone
Go get a life and ease the pain
Dog's a best friend's dog
Dog's a best friend's dog

Dog's a best friend's dog
Dog's a best friend's dog
Dog's a best friend's dog
Some dreams you dream you alone
Dog's a best friend's dog
