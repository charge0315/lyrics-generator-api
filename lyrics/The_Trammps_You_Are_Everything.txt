You're my everything
The sun that shines above you
Makes the blue birds sing
The stars that twinkle way up in the sky
Tell me I'm in love
When I kiss your lips
I feel the rolling thunder to my finger tips
And all the while my head is in a spin
Deep within I'm in love
You're my everything
And nothing really matters but the love you bring
You're my everything
To see you in the morning with those big bright eyes
You're my everything
Forever and a day I need you close to me
You're my everything
You never have to worry, never fear, for I am here
You're my everything
I live up on the land and see the sky above
I swim within her ocean, sweet and warm
There's no storm my love
You're my everything
And nothing really matters but the love you bring
You're my everything
To see you in the morning with those big bright eyes
You're my everything
Forever, and a day I need you close to me
You're my everything
You never have to worry, never fear, for I am here
When I hold you tight
There's nothing that can harm you
In the lonely night
I'll come to you and keep you safe and warm
It's so strong my love
When I kiss your lips
I feel the rolling thunder to my finger tips
And all the while my head is in a spin
Deep within -'m in love
