In a cast iron cage
You couldn't help but stare like a creature
With the laws of a brothel
And the fireproof bones of a preacher
And your lingo coined
From the sacrament of a casino
On a government loan
With a guillotine in your libido

Who's gonna answer
Profanity prayers?
Who's gonna answer
Profanity prayers?

Well, you know how it looks
When you pull all your books from the table
And you stare into space
Trying to discern what to say now
And you wait at the light
And watch for a sign that you're breathing
Because you can't just live on air
And float to the ceiling

Who's gonna answer
Profanity prayers?
Who's gonna answer
Profanity prayers?
Who's gonna answer
Profanity prayers?
Who's gonna answer
Profanity prayers?
(Who's gonna answer?)
