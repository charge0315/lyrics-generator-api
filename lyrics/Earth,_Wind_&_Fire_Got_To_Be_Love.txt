What is this energy that's speeding up my heart?
Been getting the best of me, I don't know where to start
My intuition won't tell what it means
But I can feel there's something healing me
Whatever it is
Got to be love (it's got to be love)
Yeah, got to be love
Whatever it is
Got to be love (it's got to be love)
Yeah, got to be love
What is this chemistry that's talking me so high?
Asking for all of me without me knowing why
From dusk to dawn, I'm on this mystery
Wondering how this came to be
Remembering I saw your face
My intuition won't tell what it means
But I can feel there's something healing me
Got to be love (it's got to be love)
Yeah, got to be love
Got to be love (it's got to be love)
Yeah, got to be love
