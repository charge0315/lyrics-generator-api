I can't believe
That I fell in love with you
Can't believe it's true
Every night I pray, dear Lord
Please make her love me more
More each day
Make it last

I've been in love
But it never felt like this
Never quite like this
No one ever made me feel
So wrong and so for sure
Since with you
Make it last

When I'm with you, the angels sing
You are the glow of early spring
If this is a dream, I just got to keep on
Dreaming, dreaming
Each day with you
Seems better than yesterday
Wild and wonderful
Lighter than the air, I could fly
Higher than the cloud in the sky
Make it last

When I'm with you, the angels sing
You are the glow of early spring
If this is a dream, I just got to keep on
Dreaming, dreaming
Lighter than the air, I could fly
Higher than the cloud in the sky
Make it last
Lighter than the air, I could fly
Higher than the cloud in the sky
Make it last
Lighter than the air, I could fly
Higher than the cloud in the sky
Make it last
Lighter than the air, I could fly
Higher than the cloud in the sky
Make it last
