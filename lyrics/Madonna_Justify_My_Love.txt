Yeah

I want to kiss you in Paris
I want to hold your hand in Rome
I want to run naked in a rainstorm
Make love in a train cross-country
You put this in me
So now what?
So now what?

Wanting
Needing
Waiting
For you to justify my love
(My love) Hoping
(My love) Praying
For you to justify my love

Okay

I want to know you
Not like that
I don't want to be your mother
I don't want to be your sister either
I just want to be your lover
I want to have you, baby
Kiss me, that's right, kiss me

Wanting
Needing
Waiting
For you to justify my love
(My love) Yearning
(My love) Burning
For you to justify my love

What are you gonna do?
What are you gonna do?
Talk to me
Tell me your dreams
Am I in them?
Tell me your fears
Are you scared?
Tell me your stories
I'm not afraid of who you are
We can fly
Poor is the man
Whose pleasures depend
On the permission of another
Love me
That's right, love me
I want to be your baby
Mm, yeah

Wanting
Needing
Waiting
For you to justify my love
(My love) I'm open
(My love) And ready
For you to justify my love
(My love) To justify my love
(My love) Wanting
(For you) To justify (To justify my love)
Waiting
(My love) To justify my love
(My love) Praying
(For you) To justify (To justify my love)
To justify my love
I'm open to justify my love (My love)
(My love)
