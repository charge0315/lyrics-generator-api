Overnight, I'm caught up in your love
My surprise, baby
All at once, you're all I'm thinking of
Come share my life
I'm here for you

Welcome to my love
Embracing you
Welcome to my love

Girl, my love is for you
Welcome to a love that's true
I think about the time I spend with you
Happy days, baby
The more I touch, the more I want of you, yeah
You changed my ways
Got next to me

Welcome to my love, ooo, yeah
Can I talk to you
Welcome, love, to me and you
(Bridge)

You're my dream come true
Welcome to my love, ooo, yeah
Layin' next to you
Welcome to my love, ooo, yeah
You're my dream come true
Welcome, love, to me and you
While I'm layin' next to you
Welcome, love, to a love that's true
Let me talk to you
Welcome, love, for to be with you
I'm here for you
Welcome, love, I think of you
