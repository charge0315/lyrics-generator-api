All these years I've waited
Keeping my flame
I'm thinking of my lady love
But I don't know her name
But I can dream
I can dream, dream, dream
I can dream
Until she comes along
I've seen, I've found my windows
O-de-la-lu
She waits around for solid ground
If it doesn't come soon
She knows what to do
She's gonna dream
Gotta dream, dream, dream
She's gonna dream
She's waiting for the-who? Who?
Don't keep me a stranger baby
Spare me the pain
I get no different
Standing, stealing
I can't stop the rain
But I can dream
I can dream, dream, dream
I can dream
I can dream, dream, dream
Once you know
You can't fake it
You can't say
Just might make it
Some will fall
Some will shake it
Standing tall
'Cause they can dream
Yeah, they can dream, dream, dream
They can dream
They can dream, dream, dream
Wake up and dream
Wake up and dream, dream, dream, yeah
Wake up and dream, now
Wake up and dream, dream
Dream-yeah
