Girl in the class
Nice in the Mao
This is my first teenage love
She's a Chinese "JET SET"
Maybe one-way bitter love
Everyone's gotta steal her heart
No one has ever done
Just because
Oh, you're splendid
But lovin' nobody
I don't get it
I don't get it
All descendents
Idiotize me
I don't get it
I don't get it
In the night
Cryin' in my mind
It's torture
Girl in the Mao
Girl in the Mao"¦
