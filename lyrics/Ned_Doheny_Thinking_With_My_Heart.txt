On a bench in perfect weather
Adrift in loving thoughts of us together
Carries me home
To the only love I know
Resolute, I stand corrected
Open-hearted and unprotected
A man and his pride
Weathered and worn
Thinkin' with my heart
Has brought me back to you
I was born to play this part
Yes, I swear I will be true
Shakes his head in absent wonder
Disbelieving the spell he's under
Mind and body slip from his control
Thinkin' with his heart
Has brought him to his knees
(Now that you know, what will you do?)
Tried to play it smart
Now he's fryin' by degrees
How sweet this rapture be
(How sweet it'll be)
So compelling to surrender me
(Surrender me)
I can't shake it
Whoa, whoa
Yeah, yeah
Whoa, whoa
Yeah, yeah
On a bench in perfect weather
Adrift in loving thoughts of us together
Carries me home
(Carries me home)
To the only love I know
Thinkin' with my heart
Has brought me back to you
(Now that you know, what will you do?)
I was born to play this part
Yes, I swear I will be true
(I swear it, I swear it)
Thinkin' with my heart
Has brought me back to you
(Now that you know, what will you do?)
I was born to play this part
Yes, I swear I will be true
(I swear it, I swear it)
Whoa, whoa, ooh
(Now that you know, what will you do?)
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
(Now that you know, what will you do?)
