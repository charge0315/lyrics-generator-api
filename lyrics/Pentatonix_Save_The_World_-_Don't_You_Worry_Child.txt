Who's gonna save the world, save the world tonight?
Who's gonna bring you back to life?
We're gonna make it, you and I
We're gonna save the world tonight

There was a time I used to look into my father's eyes
In a happy home, I was a king, I had a golden throne
Those days are gone, now the memories are on the wall
I hear the songs from the places where I was born

My father said, "Don't you worry, don't you worry, child
Heaven's got a plan for you
Don't you worry, don't you worry, child"
Yeah

Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh

We're far from home, it's for the better
What we dream, it's all that matters
We're on our way, united

Turn the crowd up now, we'll never back down
Shoot down the skyline, watch it in prime time
Turn up the love now, listen up now
Turn up the love

Who's gonna save the world, save the world tonight?
Who's gonna bring you back to life?
We're gonna make it
We're gonna make it, you, you and I
We're gonna save the world tonight

Don't you worry, don't you worry, child
Heaven's got a plan for you
Don't you worry, don't you worry, child
Woah, who's gonna save the world save the world tonight?
(Don't you worry, don't you worry, child)
(Heavens got a plan for you)
Who's gonna bring you back to life?
(Don't you worry, don't you worry, child)

Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Don't you worry, don't you worry, child
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
'Cause I'm gonna bring you back to life
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Don't you worry, no
Don't you worry, no
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Don't you worry, no
Don’t you worry, no
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
