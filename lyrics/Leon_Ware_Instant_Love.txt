Instant love
Instant love
Instant happiness (yeah!)
Instant love like we're feelin'
Has got to be the best (yeah!)

We don't have to go through changes
Our ESP is so complete (so complete)
Baby, we're not really strangers
We just never got a chance to meet, angel

All I wanna do is hold you more than that light
And in between
The only time I ever scold you
Is if you wanna beef

Ooh, instant love
Instant love happenin' right now (yeah!)
Instant love like we're feelin'
Help me make it last somehow

You're the kind of girl a guy would die for
Absolute perfection's hard to find
Make me yours to make me trouble
To make you mine

Instant love
Instant love
Just like in my dreams (yeah, yeah!)
Instant love
I can touch you
This is much more than it seems (oh-ho!)
Instant love
Instant love thrives on tender care (yes, it does!)
Instant love
Let's cultivate it once it's takin' root somewhere, ooh-hoo
Instant love!
Instant love!
Instant happiness (yeah, yeah!)
Instant love like we're feelin'
Has got to be the best!
