I wake up in the morning and look into the mirror
The same old face is staring back at me
Then I cry  cause I don't seem to get any nearer
To the person I wish I could be
Chorus:
And so I look into your love eyes and you see me
Through your love eyes
And beauty is what you'll see in me
Cause you washed me
With those tears fallen from your love eyes
All that people see is the part of me that's showing
They figure that's the way I'll always be
But you look ahead to the day I'm full grown
And there's nothing but beauty in me
Repeat Chorus
I've heard it said that love is blind
And I know that just ain't true
Cause love can leave the past behind
Oh, Lord, I want to love like you do
Repeat Chorus
