It ain't nothin' but an us thang
And it's time for us to step it up and respect
That level of sisterhood
That's been holding up our neighborhood
And if it wasn't for our mothers, there would be no brothers
And if it wasn't for our sisters, there would be no misters
So it ain't nothin' but a us thang
She's strong and that's a fact
Now it's time for us to take up the slack
Step it up, step it up, time to go to work

History hidden from me
To hide my identity
So I'd never feel
I am somebody
You've gouged my eyes
I see more clearly
You've tried to rob
My humanity
My spirit you tried to break
My soul you tried to take
There's no need to be afraid
'Cause I won't do unto you now

Amen
All that we've been through
Our time has come to rejoice
A new agenda's due
Amen
It's time to know the truth
Our time has come to rejoice
A new agenda's due

Time to step it up, step it up, better check yourself
I get vexed to protect what we got left

(No, no) Because of my gender
(No) I've heard no too many times
Because of my race
I've heard no too many times
(No, no) But with every no
I grow in strength, that is why
African-American woman
I stand tall with pride
You want to know what it takes
To rid yourself of me now
There's nothing you can do
Accept me for who I am now

Amen
All that we've been through
Our time has come to rejoice
A new agenda's due

Check it out, check it out, gotta check it out
It's a new thang, check it out, come on with it now
Time to step it up, come on (Hey), step it up

Amen
All that we've been through
Our time has come to rejoice
A new agenda's due
Amen
It's time to know the truth
Our time has come to rejoice
A new agenda's due

Step it up, step it up, it's time to step it up
Step it up, check it out, come on

Time to step it up, step it up, better check yourself
I get vexed to protect what we got left
Alone, lookin' for your own, here it is
I know what they're sayin', but the plan ain't playin' at the rank
Gotta step with us, us to discuss, a must
It ain't nothin' but an us thang
Rewind back to the time
Where the color of a mother had 'em call it a crime, brother
What in the world and the world says where is
The Black man's support of the woman and children?
Time to step it up, step it up, it's playoff time
And the rhyme go to check, so check yourself

Amen (Time to step it up, step it up)
A new agenda's due (Here we go)

Amen
All that we've been through
Our time has come to rejoice
A new agenda's due
Amen
It's time to know the truth
Our time has come to rejoice
A new agenda's due
Amen
All that we've been through
Our time has come to rejoice
A new agenda's due
Amen
It's time to know the truth
Our time has come to rejoice
A new agenda's due

Amen
All that we've been through
Our time has come to rejoice
