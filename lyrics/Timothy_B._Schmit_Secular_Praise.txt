Schmit
When I was a little boy
I had a lot of friends
Running up and down the streets
'Til the day's end
There was nothing that we could not do
Superman strong
Keepers of the neighborhood
Then we all went home
Time rolls by
But it all seems like the wink of an eye
Now I look straight ahead and smile
We had a lot to dream about
Music filled our minds
Sailing all around our heads
In perfect time
(And I say)
Hallelujah
Gonna shout it out
Gonna say it again
Hallelujah
Gonna breathe it in
I like the smell of an open field
Don't mind a city street
I walk along singing to myself
To make ends meet
Don't go to church, but I feel the weight
Some people think I'm shy
Still I hope to shake the hand of fate
Before I die
I don't know
Why some have less and some have more
All my sorrow could all fit in a bedroom drawer
So many lessons from way back then
But still I wish I knew
How I became the lucky one
To be with you
(And I say)
Hallelujah
Gonna shout it out
Gonna say it again
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Gonna shout it out
Gonna say it again
Hallelujah
Gonna breathe it in
