You're ruling the way that I move and I breathe your air
You only can rescue me, this is my prayer
If you were mine, If you were mine
I wouldn't want to go to heaven
I cherish the day, I won't go astray, I won't be afraid
You won't catch me running
You're ruling the way that I move, you take my air
You show me how deep love can be
You're ruling the way that I move and I breathe your air
You only can rescue me, this is my prayer
I cherish the day, I won't go astray, I won't be afraid
You won't catch me running
I cherish the day, I won't go astray, I won't be afraid
Won't run away
You show me how deep love can be
You show me how deep love can be, this is my prayer
I cherish the day, I won't go astray, I won't be afraid
Won't run away, won't shy
I cherish the day, I won't go astray
I cherish the day
I cherish the day
I cherish the day
I cherish the day
I cherish the day
