I know I was wrong by leaving you by yourself
I say something got a hold on me and I lost control
Now I know where I belong and I wanna come back home
I need your love and Baby
I need it so bad
Here I stand with my heart in my hand
Don't make me feel any less than I am
Don't make me crawl on my hands back to you
Oh
I said it:
If I could only get your love back
If I could only get your love back
I know you wanna make me pay for all the wrong that I've done
Well Baby
I'm ready
I'm ready to pay any price you ask
I don't care for what I have to do
Long as I can get close to you
Your sweet love was the best love I've ever had
Here I stand with a tear in my eye
I ain't ashamed to let you see me cry
To live without your love I'd better die
Baby
Please hold me in your arms
If I could only get your love back
. .
I'll be so satisfied
Now I know where I belong and I wanna come back home
I need your love and Baby I need it so bad
Here I stand with my heart in my hand
Don't make me feel any less than I am
Don't let me crawl on my hands and knees back to you!
If I could only get your love back
. .
