Dinner's ready
And the wine is chilled
My baby's coming over
Well, I know just how I feel
Because I don't wanna lose your love
Think how it feels, baby
It's gettin' harder to conceal, yeah
Do I fit in the life you've been livin', boy?
(Baby, say I do)
Do you feel all the love I've been givin' you?

Oh, when you come home
Do you care to see me?
Things ain't the way they used to be, baby, but
I can't believe that's your only reason
You've got to say just what's the reason
Don't take my love for granted, boy
And then turn around and regret it, whoa

I don't wanna lose your love (I don't wanna)
I don't wanna lose your love
Don't wanna lose your love (Don't wanna lose you)
I don't wanna lose your love (Oh, come on)
Come on and say that you will (Say you will)
I'll do the best to fulfill (I will be there)
I don't wanna lose your love
I don't wanna lose your love
I think you need my love
You can't defeat my love (My love)
You won't believe my love (Don't wanna lose you)
I don't wanna lose your love

Hey, hey, yeah, hey, hey, well
You just don't know, oh, whoa
What you do to me, well
I wanna ask you somethin'
Hey, baby, hey, baby
I think we can make it, how 'bout you?
But don't just send me away
To be alone, I don't (Away)
Think I can take it

'Cause if you tell me to go (Yeah, I will)
I will leave you, oh (For sure)
Don't ask me to stay and do me wrong, yeah
Do I fit in the life you've been livin', boy? (Baby, say I do)
Do you feel all my love I've been givin' you?

Whoa, I want the love you love, most of all
Now I'm the one you never call, baby, but
I don't think you really wanna leave me (No, no)
I think you're confused and you don't want to believe it (No, no)

You can't take love and just walk away
(Don't take it and walk away)
With the guilt that you carry
You'll be back some day, whoa

I don't wanna lose your love (I don't wanna)
I don't wanna lose your love
Don't wanna lose your love (Don't wanna lose you)
I don't wanna lose your love (Well)
Come on and say that you will
I'll be there to fulfill
I don't wanna lose your love
I don't wanna lose your love
I don't wanna lose your love
Don't wanna lose your love
Don't wanna lose your love
I don't wanna lose your love

Yeah, hey, oh, yeah
Ooh, you just don't know
No, what you do to me
Well, well, ooh, ooh

I don't wanna lose, lose your love
I don't wanna lose, lose your love
I don't wanna lose, lose your love
I don't wanna lose, lose your love
I don't wanna lose, lose your love
I don't wanna lose, lose your love
