You're all good dreams that I've ever had
All wrapped up into one
You're just what lovin' is all about
And it's only begun
And the way that you make me feel
Let's me know that this love is real
And at last I can finally see
It's for me
Love has found its way to me
Ooh, such a good, good love I got
Love has found its way to me
I wanna thank ya, I wanna love ya, I wanna hold ya
I've always needed someone like you
Who could make my world be so right
Then you came along and then you taught me to
See myself in a different light
Then you came and you took control
Of my heart and my very soul
And I saw that it could be so
Heavenly
Love has found its way to me
Ooh, such a good, good love I got
Love has found its way to me
I wanna thank you, I wanna love you, I wanna hold you, baby
And the way that you make me feel
Let's me know that this love is real
And at last I can finally see
It's for me
Love has found its way to me
Ooh, such a good, good love I got
Love has found its way to me
I wanna know just how you feel, go out and say it
Love has found its way to me
I gotta love you, love you, love you
Love has found its way to me
Good love, sweet love, complete love
Love has found its way to me
Got love, my love, my love
Love has found its way to me
(Can you feel it now, can you feel it now)
Love has found its way to me
(Feel it now, can you feel it, baby)
Love has found its way to me
