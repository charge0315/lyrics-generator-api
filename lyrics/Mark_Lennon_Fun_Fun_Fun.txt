I’m bored
Let’s have a drink
We’ve got nothing but time
And the booze helps me think
Are we having fun yet?
Hey there, how are you?
I’ve seen you around
Let’s get together
Let’s go out on the town
Are we having fun yet?
How’d you get to be so pretty
It makes me want to throw up
I want to write you a poem
I want to sketch your face on napkins
Are we having fun yet?
