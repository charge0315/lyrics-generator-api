It’s like you always want to change me
Shake me
It’s like you really wanna break me
Turn me into you
And I want to turn it down when you play that
Music’s not the funk I want to hear
(Music is not the funk)
That’s Not The Funk I Want
Say what you like I’m walking away now
Spit those bricks at me again baby
I feel like breaking glass again
It’s like you want to spit the bricks out
Cut me (cut me down to size)
It’s like you think you’re gonna save me
(Save me)
But you’re burning me alive
You want to treat me like a bad dog
Chain me all day up to you
That’s not the way I wanna see things
There things, hate things that you do
I feel I’m breaking glass again
And I want to turn it down when you play that
Music’s not the funk I want to hear
That’s Not The Funk I Want
It’s not the way to move me
Say what you like I’m walking away now
Spit those bricks at me again
Spitting those bricks at me again babe
That’s Not The Funk I Want
Say what you like I’m walking away
If you spit those bricks at me again
Say what you like I’m walking away
If you spit those bricks at me again
It’s like you always want to change me
(It’s like you wanna change me)
I ain’t changing nothing over you
It’s like you always want to break me
(It’s like you wanna break me)
I still ain’t changing nothing over you
Oh baby
I want to turn it down when you play that
(turn it down)
Music’s not the funk I want to hear
(Music is not the funk)
That’s Not The Funk I Want, I wanna hear
(It’s not the way to move me)
Say what you like I’m walking away now
(Say what you like)
Spit those bricks at me again
(Spitting those bricks at me again baby)
That’s Not The Funk I Want
That’s not the funk that I want from you
That’s Not The Funk I Want
Oh baby don’t you do that
Oh baby don’t you do that
