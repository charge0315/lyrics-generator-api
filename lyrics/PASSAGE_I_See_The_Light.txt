I used to live my life in darkness
Just a slave in the Devil’s fortress
I used to live my life in doubt
Wondering what life’s about
Then one day a voice I heard
It said study the Bible and learn about the Word
And all the things I did see
And I never before believed in anything
Chorus:
I see the light
The Lord is giving
Oh, I see the light
I see the light
The Lord is giving
Oh, I see the light
I used to live from day to day
Wondering what the people say
I used to love the things I touched
And everything else didn’t mean much
But now I see the light
And I’m on my way
To a peace of mind that will always stay
You can have the same thing too
Just shine your light and He’ll see you through
Repeat Chorus
