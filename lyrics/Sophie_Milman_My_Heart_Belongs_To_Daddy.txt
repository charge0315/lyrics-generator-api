While tearing off a game of golf
I may make a play for the caddy
But if I do, I don't follow through
'Cause my heart belongs to daddy
If I invite a boy some night
To dine on my fine finnan haddie
I just adore his asking for more
'Cause my heart belongs to daddy
Yes, my heart belongs to daddy
And I simply couldn't be bad
Yes, my heart belongs to daddy
Yada da dada da ba ah da
And I want to warn you, laddie
Though I know you're perfectly swell
Yes, my heart belongs to daddy
'Cause my daddy he treats me so well

See, my heart belongs to daddy
