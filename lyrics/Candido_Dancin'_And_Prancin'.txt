Dancin' and prancin'
Dancin' and prancin'
Yeah, yeah, get down, get down
Dancin' and prancin'
Dancin' and prancin'
Yeah, yeah, get down, get down
Dancin' all night
Feelin' all right
Dancin' all night
Feelin' all right
Dancin' all night
Feelin' all right
Dancin' all night
Feelin' all right
When your dancin' and prancin'
You got no time to frown
'Cause your smilin'
And smilin' really getting down
Hey, you're movin' and groovin'
Kickin' up them heights
You've been cookin' you're cookin'
Reaching for the heights
Dancin' and prancin'
Dancin' and prancin'
Everybody's groovin' and smokin'
Ooh I'm feeling high
Within the sound you've found
You can take it to the sky
Turn for swingin' and clingin'
Yeah, time to rock
Do it all night and all right
Don't worry 'bout the clock
Dancin' and prancin'
Yeah, yeah
Dancin' and prancin'
Aye, aye
