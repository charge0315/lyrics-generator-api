Let's go back to your childhood, childhood, childhood...

The Odd Boy lay down by the football field
Took out a slim volume of Mallarmé
The centre-forward called him an imbecile
It's an Odd Boy who doesn't like sport

Sport, sport, masculine sport
Equips a young man for Society
Yes, sport turns out a jolly good sort
It's an Odd Boy who doesn't like sport

Dear Mr. Poxham, would you kindly excuse Steven from Games today?
He has had a nasty cold over the weekend and still has headaches and feels a bit snotty
I don't feel he should be outside with the rougher type of boy, as he is a little delicate
Hoping you will understand, yours sincerely, Nellie Maynard, Mrs
(Give him a nice, cold shower.)

Sport, sport, masculine sport
Equips a young man for Society
Yes, sport turns out a jolly good sort
It's an Odd Boy who doesn't like sport
