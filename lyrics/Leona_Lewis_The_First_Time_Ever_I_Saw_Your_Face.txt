The first time, ever I saw your face
I thought the sun rose in your eyes
And the moon and the stars
Were the gifts you gave
To the dark, and the empty skies
And the first time, ever I kissed your mouth
I felt the earth move in my hands
Like the trembling heart
Of a captive bird
That was there at my command
My love
And the first time, ever I lay with you
I felt your heart so close to mine
And I knew our joy
Would fill the Earth
And last, and last, and last
Till the end of time, my love
The first time ever I saw your face
Your face
Your face
Your face
