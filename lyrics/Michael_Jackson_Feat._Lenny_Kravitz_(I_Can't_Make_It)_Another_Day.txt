My life
Has taken me beyond the planets and the stars
And you're the only one that could take me this far
I'll be forever searching for your love, love (Hoo!)

I walked away, but I was wrong
I can't make it another day
You're the one that makes me strong
I can't make it another day
You're the fire that keeps me warm
I can't make it another day
How will I get through this storm?
I can't live another day without your love

Come on now, hee-hee

At night (At night)
I pray before I sleep in hope of finding you (Finding you)
I've opened up my heart, I want you to come through
I close my eyes, I'm searching for your love, love (Hoo!)

I walked away, but I was wrong
I can't make it another day
You're the one that makes me strong
I can't make it another day
You're the fire that keeps me warm
I can't make it another day
How will I get through this storm?
I can't make another day without your love (Hoo!)
I walked away, but I was wrong
I can't make it another day
You're the one that makes me strong
I can't make it another day
You're the fire that keeps me warm
I can't make it another day
How will I get through this storm?
I can't live another day without your love

Hoo-hoo, go on, babe
Hoo-hoo, hoo
Doo-dee-da-da, da-doo-dee
Come on now (Hoo-hoo-hoo!)

I walked away, but I was wrong
I can't make it another day
You're the one that makes me strong
I can't make it another day
You're the fire that keeps me warm
I can't make it another day
How will I get through this storm?
I can't live another day without your love (It's just too much for me)

I walked away, but I was wrong (It's just too much for me)
I can't make it another day (It's too much for me)
You're the one that makes me strong (It's just too much for me)
I can't make it another day (Hoo-hoo! I can't make it, baby)
You're the fire that keeps me warm (I can't make it, baby)
I can't make it another day (It's just too much for me)
You're the fire to the storm (It's just too much for me)
I can't live another day without your love (Hoo-hoo! Yeah)
I walked away, but I was wrong
I can't make it another day
You're the one that makes me strong
I can't make it another day
