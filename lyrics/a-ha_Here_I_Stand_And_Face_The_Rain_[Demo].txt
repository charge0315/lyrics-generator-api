(Ahhhhhhhhhhaaaaaaaaa)
Help me
I need your love
Don't walk away
The dark scares me so
We're nothing apart
Let's stay friends forever
Forever
Here I stand and face the rain
I know that nothing's gonna be the same again
I fear for what tomorrow brings
Trust me
For whom I am
Lay all your pains
Into these hands
I've got nothing to say
But let's stay friends forever
Forever
Here I stand and face the rain
I know that nothing's gonna be the same again
I fear for what tomorrow brings
Here I stand and face the pain
Of knowing that nothing's gonna be the same again
I fear for what tomorrow brings
Let's stay friends forever
Forever... forever
Let's stay friends forever
Let's stay friends forever
Here I stand and face the rain
Here I stand and face the rain
Here I stand and face the rain
(Here I stand and face the rain)
Knowing nothing's gonna be the same
(Here I stand and face the rain)
Again
Here I stand and face the rain
Knowing nothing's gonna be the same
Here I stand and face the rain
Knowing nothing's gonna be the same
Here I stand and face the rain (Ahhhhhhhhhhaaaaaaaaa)
Knowing nothing's gonna be the same (Ahhhhhhhhhhaaaaaaaaa)
