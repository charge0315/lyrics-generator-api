Whispers, potions, puppet with needles
Whispers, potions, puppet with needles

Black night, right time
It's all about, it's voodoo night
Can't you feel it?
Strangers surround the voodoo spell
But you saw them close your mind
Don't listen 'cause big zombie makes a night of it
We're all here and break the spell, don't follow him
Big zombie seeks a bride tonight

Voodoo night
Voodoo night
Whispers, potions, puppet with needles
Whispers, potions, puppet with needles

Witchcraft, magic
Odd songs to hear, it's voodoo night
Does it haunt you
The fateful wish of voodoo spell

Voodoo night
Voodoo night
Voodoo night
Voodoo night
Voodoo night
