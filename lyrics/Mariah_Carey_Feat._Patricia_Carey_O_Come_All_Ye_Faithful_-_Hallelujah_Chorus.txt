Oh, come all ye faithful
Joyful and triumphant!
Oh, come ye, oh, come ye to Bethlehem
Come and behold Him
Born the King of Angels
Oh, come, let us adore Him
Oh, come, let us adore Him
Oh, come, let us adore Him
Christ the Lord

And He shall reign forever and ever
And He shall reign forever and ever
For the God omnipotent reigneth
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah

Oh, sing choirs of angels
Sing in exultation!
Sing all ye citizens of heaven above
Glory to God
In the Highest
Oh, come, let us adore Him
Oh, come, let us adore Him
Oh, come, let us adore Him
Christ the Lord

(And He shall reign forever and evermore)
And He shall reign forever and evermore
