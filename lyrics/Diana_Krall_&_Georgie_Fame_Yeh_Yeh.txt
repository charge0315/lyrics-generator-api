Every evening when all my day's work is through
I call my baby and ask him what shall we do
I mention movies but he don't seem to dig that
And then he asks me why don't I come to his flat
And have some supper and let the evening pass by
By playing records besides a groovy hi-fi
I say yeh yeh, and that's what I say
I say yeh yeh

My baby loves me, she gets a feeling so fine
But when she love me, she makes me know that she's mine
And when she kisses, I feel the fire get hot
She never misses, she gives it all that she's got
And when she asks me if everything is okay
I got my answer, the only thing I can say
I say yeh yeh, that's what I say
I say yeh yeh

We'll play a melody and
Turn the lights down low so no one can see
We gotta do that, we gotta do that
We gotta do that, we gotta do that
And there'll be no one else alive
In all the world 'cept you and me
Yeh, yeh, yeh, yeh, yeh
Yeh yeh, yeh yeh

Oh pretty baby, I never knew such a thrill
Just thought I'd tell you because I'm trembling still
But pretty baby, I want you all for my own
I think I'm ready to leave those others alone
Don't need to ask me if everything is okay
I got my answer, the only thing I can say
I say yeh yeh, that's what I say
I say yeh yeh, that's what I say
I say yeh yeh

We'll play a melody and
Turn the lights down low so no one can see
We gotta do that, we gotta do that
We gotta do that, we gotta do that
And there'll be no one else alive
In all the world 'cept you and me
Yeh yeh yeh, yeh yeh yeh
Yeh yeh yeh yeh

Oh pretty baby, I never knew such a thrill
Just thought I'd tell you, because I'm trembling still
But pretty baby, I want you all for my own
I think I'm ready to leave those others alone
Don't need to ask me if everything is okay
I got my answer, the only thing I can say
I say yeh yeh, that's what I say
I say yeh yeh, that's what I say
I say yeh yeh, that's what I say
I say yeh yeh
That's what I say, I say yeh yeh
That's what I say, I say yeh yeh
That's what I say, yeh
