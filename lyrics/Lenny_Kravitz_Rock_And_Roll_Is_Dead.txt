Ooo-oooh, yeah!
You think you're on top of the world
But you know it's really over
Running 'round with diamond rings
And coke spoons that are overflowing
Rock and roll is dead
But all the money in the world
Can't buy you from the place you're going to
Ooo-oooh, yeah

Rock and roll is dead
Rock and roll is dead
Rock and roll is dead

You can't even sing or play an instrument
So you just scream instead
Oooh, yeah
You're living for an image
So you got five hundred women in your bed
Oooh, yeah!
Rock and roll is dead
But it's real hard to be yourself
When you're living with those demons in your head
Ooo-oooh, yeah!

Rock and roll is dead
Rock and roll is dead
Rock and roll is dead
Rock and roll is dead
Rock and roll is dead
Rock and roll is dead
Rock and roll is dead
Rock and roll is dead
Rock and roll is dead
Rock and roll is dead
