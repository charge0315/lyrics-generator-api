Remember when you left, yeah, you had your rules about playin' the game
And any day, you could walk away, feelin' no pain
Now look at yourself
Yeah, you're all hung up on somebody else
And in your eyes
I see all the signs
Of the misery
That you laid on me

Baby, baby, didn't you know you'd have to cry sometime?
Oh, didn't you know? Didn't you know you'd have to hurt sometime?
Didn't you know you'd have to lose your pride?
Didn't anybody tell you love had another side?

Ooh, you used to be so proud
Now your head's a little lower and you walk a little slower and you don't talk so loud
Now you've gotten wise
Yeah, you know how love can build you up one moment and the next, cut you down to size
And then, you discover all she told you was a bunch of lies

Didn't you know you'd have to cry sometime?
Oh, baby, didn't you know? Didn't you know you'd have to hurt sometime?
Didn't you know you'd have to lose your pride?
Didn't anybody tell you love had another side?

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh

Now you come to me, yeah, you hurt so bad
You wanna feel the security of a love you once had
Oh, but I can't open doors and my arms can't ever
Take the place of her 'cause no other could ever
Take the place of yours, so what can I tell you?

Baby, didn't you know you'd have to cry sometime?
Oh, didn't you know? Didn't you know you'd have to hurt sometime?
Oh, didn't you know? Didn't you know you'd have to cry sometime?
Oh, didn't you know? Didn't you know you'd have to hurt sometime?
Oh, didn't you know? Oh, didn't you know you'd have to cry sometime?
Oh, didn't you know? Didn't you know you'd have to hurt sometime?
Oh, didn't you know? Didn't you know you'd have to cry sometime?
Oh, didn't you know? Didn't you know you'd have to hurt sometime?
