(H-Money)

I'm dancing in the rain
'Cause there's a fire burning deep inside for you
I'm locked into your chain
'Cause I'm addicted to the way your body moves

Oh, my heart is racin' (Ooh)
And my temperature is blazin' through the roof
(Blaze it up, blaze it up, blaze it up, blaze it up)
And I'm tired of this charade (Ah)
'Cause I can't hide the way I'm fiendin' over you (Damn, Aw!)

I'm overwhelmed
I might as well stay underneath the spell you put on me (Hey, hey, hey)
And when you touch me
I can feel it in my veins like electricity (Hey)
(Oh)

All day
I'm only thinkin' 'bout you all day
You got me goin', baby, always
I love the way your body rocks
When we rock, you rock with me
Body rock, body rock, you rock with me
Say this is how a real love's supposed to be (Oh)
Body rock, body rock, you rock with me
Say this is how a real love's supposed to be
Body rock (Knock it out)

I'm dancing in the rain
'Cause there's a fire burning deep inside for you (Rain, rain, rain)
I'm locked into your chain
'Cause I'm addicted to the way your body moves (Moves, ooh)

Oh, my heart is racin' (Ooh)
And my temperature is blazin' through the roof (To the roof)
And I'm tired of this charade (Ah)
'Cause I can't hide the way I'm fiendin' over you (Let's go, Aw!)

I'm overwhelmed
I might as well stay underneath the spell you put on me (Hey, hey, hey)
And when you touch me
I can feel it in my veins like electricity (Hey)
(Oh)

All day
I'm only thinkin' 'bout you all day
You got me goin', baby, always
I love the way your body rocks
When we rock, you rock with me
Body rock, body rock, you rock with me
Say this is how a real love's supposed to be (Oh)
Body rock, body rock, you rock with me
Say this is how a real love's supposed to be
Body rock

And it makes no sense at all (At all)
How your love takes me off the wall
And it makes my body rock
(Oh)

All day (All day)
I'm only thinkin' 'bout you all day (I'm only thinkin' 'bout you, always)
You got me goin', baby, always (Always)
I love the way your body rocks (Your body rocks, when we rock)
When we rock, you rock with me (Oh)
Body rock, body rock (Body rock), you rock with me (Ooh, ooh)
Say this is how a real love's supposed to be (Supposed to be, oh)
Body rock, body rock (Hey, hey), you rock with me
Say this is how a real love's supposed to be (Supposed to be)
Body rock

(Put your hands up in the air, put your hands up in the air)
Body rock
(Put your hands up in the air, put your hands up in the air)
Body rock, body rock
(Put your hands up in the air, put your hands up in the air)
Body rock
(Put your hands up in the air, put your hands up in the air)
Body rock, body rock
