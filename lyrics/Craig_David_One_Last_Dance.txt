One last dance with you
Even though what we have is strong
Both of us know that we've done wrong
You could lose everything
Need to give it up
Just one last dance with you
For all of the moments that we shared
All of the lies, they don't compare

You gotta go back to him, and I realize that
Every time I see your face I know
There's a part of me that can't bear to let you go

And I would give my heart
Give you the world, risk losing everything I got
I'd give it all to you
Though I don't wanna stop
I know it's the right thing to do, yeah

One last dance with you
So hard to find the words to say
But I can't see any other way
Girl, you've risked everything
Time to give it up
Just one last dance with you
And though it breaks my heart to leave
We both know it's time to let it breathe

You gotta go back to him, girl, I realize that
Every time I see your face I know
There's a part of me that can't bear to let you go

And I would give my heart
Give you the world, risk losing everything I got
I'd give it all to you
Though I don't wanna stop
I know it's the right thing to do, yeah

So many times we tried to hold back
We been here before now, girl
And it feels so cruel, yeah (It feels so cruel)
A million tears won't change the fact that
I find it hard to play the game
When I feel like I'm the one to blame

But I would give my heart
Give you the world, risk losing everything I got
I'd give it all to you
Though I don't wanna stop
I know it's the right thing to do, yeah
And I would give my heart
Give you the world, risk losing everything I got
I'd give it all to you
If I had to give you up and make our peace with God
I know it's the right thing to do, yeah

One last dance with you
Oh yeah, oh yeah
