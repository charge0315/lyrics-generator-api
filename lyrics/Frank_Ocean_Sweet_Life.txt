The best song wasn't the single, but you weren't either
Livin' in Ladera Heights, the black Beverly Hills
Domesticated paradise, palm trees and pools
The water's blue, swallow the pill
Keepin' it surreal, whatever you like
Whatever feels good, whatever takes your mountain high
Keepin' it surreal, not sugar-free
My TV ain't HD, that's too real
Grape vine, mango, peaches, and lime

A sweet life, a sweet life, sweet life
Sweet life, sweet life
A sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet life
A sweet life, a sweet life, sweetie pie

You've had a landscaper and a housekeeper since you were born
The starshine always kept you warm
So why see the world, when you got the beach?
Don't know why see the world, when you got the beach
The sweet life

The best song wasn't the single, but you couldn't turn your radio down
Satellite need a receiver, can't seem to turn the signal fully off
Transmittin' the waves
You're catchin' that breeze 'til you're dead in the grave
But you're keepin' it surreal, whatever you like
Whatever feels good, whatever takes your mountain high
Keepin' it surreal, not sugar-free
My TV ain't HD, that's too real
Grape vines, mango, peaches, and lime

A sweet life, a sweet life
A sweet life, yeah
A sweet life, a sweet life
A sweet life, live and die in the life

You've had a landscaper and a housekeeper since you were born (Yeah)
The starshine always kept you warm
So why see the world, when you got the beach?
Don't know why see the world, when you got the beach

And the water is exactly what I wanted
It's everything I thought it'd be (Thought it'd be)
But this neighborhood is gettin' trippier every day
The neighborhood is goin' ape shit crazy, aah

You've had a landscaper and a housekeeper since you were born
The starshine always kept you warm
So why see the world, when you got the beach?
Don't know why see the world, when you got the beach
The sweet life
