I wake up every morning
And I see your face in the sun
And like a eagle eye in the sky
I fly you away-ay-ay
Under my wings

At night I look at the moon and see you
Sending in the light
And like the star'll go inside
And take you away-ay-ay
Under my wings
Whoah-ah-ah

What is it with you
That has me reaching for the sky
Oh, what is it with you
That makes me cry

I wake up every morning
And I see your face in the sun
And like a eagle eye in the sky
I fly you away-ay-ay
Under my wings
Under my wings
Under my wings
Whoah-ha-ha
La la la la
Under my wings
Whoah-ha-ha
La la la la
Under my wings
Whoah-ha-ha
La la la la
Under my wings
Whoah-ha-ha
La la la la
Under my wings
Whoah-ha-ha
La la la la
Under my wings
