Feels like Heaven, yeah, when I think about you
Sparkin' that love, oh yeah, within my soul, oh

Sending chills, yeah, down to my bones, ooh

God as my witness and watching over (And watching over)
We'll write our love (We'll write our love, yeah)

Please give us strength, Lord, to fight our battles
And we can walk on, yeah, the streets of gold, hey

'Cause you take me higher (Oh, yeah) than I've ever, ever known (Yeah)
Give me good feeling (Ah, oh, yeah), like a king and queen on a throne (Like a king and queen on a throne)

Send me in ecstasy, baby (Yeah), with your love (With your love, oh-oh)

Tell me what you're thinking of (Tell me what you're thinking of)
Must be thinking 'bout love, yeah (Must be thinking 'bout love)
Put your hands into mine, love
And then we'll take off to the skies above (Ooh-ooh)
Soft like an angel (Oh, yes), ooh
Like the feathers laying on a dove
Touch me with your soul, love
'Til I lose control, ooh

Just like an angel watching over me (You protect me from my fears)
I once was blind, but now I see (Ever since the day you appeared)
I just wanna say, I want you in my life
'Til the day I die, baby (I just wanna tell you that I love you)
I just wanna say, I want you in my life
'Til the day I die, baby (I just wanna show you how I want you in my life)
I just wanna say, I want you in my life
'Til the day I die, baby (Look in my eyes, tell me right now)
Tell me right now
That you and your love will take me higher

Ooh, hey
