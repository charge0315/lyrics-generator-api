I'm shining
Got the light from your love, ah-ah-ah, all over me
You smiling
Now that I came to you, ah-ah-ah, I'm smiling too
Love (Love), I never had it (Never had it) so good
Love (Love), I never had it (Never had it) so good
Love (Love), I never had it (Never had it) so good
Love
I'm shining
You're smiling
I'm dancing on the ceiling
You got my body screaming
Screaming
For your sweet fever
From the touch of eyes, ah-ah-ah, I found that I
Was soon to be-liever, taking me, shaking me, ah ah ah
I feel it
Love (Love), I never had it (Never had it) so good
Love (Love), I never had it (Never had it) so good
Love (Love), I never had it (Never had it) so good
Love (Love), I never had it (Never had it) so good
Sweet fever
From the touch of eyes, ah-ah-ah, I found that I
Was soon to be-liever, taking me, shaking me, ah-ah-ah
I can feel it
Love (Love), I never had it (Never had it) so good
Love (Love), I never had it (Never had it) so good
Love (Love), I never had it (Never had it) so good
Love (Love), I never had it (Never had it) so good
While I'm shining, you're smiling
When I'm dancing on the ceiling, you got my body screaming
Love (Love), I never had it (Never had it) so good
Love (Love), I never had it (Never had it) so good
Sweet fever, I'm a believer
You're taking me, shaking me, ooh, I can feel it
Love (Love), I never had it (Never had it) so good
Love (Love), I never had it (Never had it) so good
I'm shining, you're smiling
I'm dancing on the ceiling, you got my body screaming
Love (Love), I never had it (Never had it) so good
Love (Love), I never had it (Never had it) so good
Sweet fever, ooh, I'm a believer
Taking me, shaking me, I can feel it
Love (Love), I never had it (Never had it) so good
Love (Love), I never had it (Never had it) so good
While I'm shining, you're smiling
I'm dancing on the ceiling, you got my body screaming
Love (Love), I never had it (Never had it) so good
Love (Love), I never had it (Never had it) so good
