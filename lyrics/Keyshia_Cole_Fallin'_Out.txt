Been sittin', thinkin'
'Bout you and I and wondering why we're not getting along
So frustrated, 'cause what we had was a happy home
I don't know what the situation is, but I can tell in the way we kiss
We don't talk no more, it feels better when I'm alone

Sometimes, I feel like there's no getting through to you
Like you don't appreciate all that I do
You gotta show me that you want me to stay
Don't turn and walk away

Baby, I'm slowly fallin' out
Of love with you, I don't know what to do
How did we end up here this way?
What are we gonna do?
I'm slowly fallin' out
Baby, we're trippin' on silly things
Boy, I need you to meet me halfway
If you want me to be with you

I remember when I'd be with my friends
You checked on me and made time to call
But how things have changed
Now, I don't hear from you at all
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Sometimes, I feel like there's no getting through to you
Like you don't appreciate all that I do (All that I do)
You gotta show me that you want me to stay
Don't turn and walk away, no

Baby, I'm slowly fallin' out (Ooh, yeah, yeah)
Of love with you, I don't know what to do (I don't know what)
How did we end up here this way?
What are we gonna do?
I'm slowly fallin' out
Baby, we're trippin' on silly things
Boy, I need you to meet me halfway
If you want me to be with you

Don't let your pride get in the way
For something we worked so hard, don't throw it away
I've been tryin' to make you see
Everything you need is right here with me

Sometimes, I feel like there's no getting through to you (Getting through to you)
Like you don't appreciate all that I do (All that I do)
Boy, you gotta show me that you want me to stay
Don't turn and walk away (Baby, I'm slowly)
Don't turn and walk away

Baby, I'm slowly fallin' out (Out)
Of love with you, I don't know what to do (Don't know what to do)
How did we end up here this way?
What are we gonna do? (What are we gonna do, baby?)
I'm slowly fallin' out (I'm slowly, yeah)
Baby, we're tripping on silly things
Boy, I need you to meet me halfway
If you want me to be with you (I'm tired of giving my all)

Slowly fallin'
Slowly fallin' (Oh)
How did we end up here this way?
I just wanna know, what are we gonna do?
(I'm) Slowly fallin' (Slowly fallin')
Slowly fallin'
How did we end up here this way?
What are we gonna do?
(Oh, I'm) Slowly fallin'
Slowly fallin'
How did we end up here this way?
What are we gonna do? Yeah
Slowly fallin' (Oh, slowly)
Slowly fallin'
How did we end up here this way?
I just wanna know, what are we gonna do?
