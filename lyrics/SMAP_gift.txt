I'm dancing on and playing with you
Like we're laughing in the rain
Feeling your heart and soul
I never needed someone else
All I want is you beside
Even things are not alright
Coz all I have is you this time
And I want you on my side
Chorus
Coz this heart of mine
Beating faster all the time
Every time I see your face
It makes me feel I'm so alive
I see the color in your face
It gives the day a light
Ain't gone some on my place
Suddenly it becomes bright
You made my life so beautiful
I never fall out of control
I see your pictures on the wall
It gives chill inside my soul
Chorus
Coz this heart of mine
Beating faster all the time
Every time I see your face
It makes me feel I'm so alive
Goodbye now please don't you cry
Goodbye now just close your eyes
I'm so hypocrite
I regret then forget
Don't want to throw away the gift of my life
Forget me now for not trying
Forget me now for being a debt
I'm dancing on and playing with you
Like we're laughing in the rain
Feeling your heart and soul
I never needed someone else
All I want is you beside
Even things are not alright
Coz all I have is you this time
And I want you on my side
Chorus
Coz this heart of mine
Beating faster all the time
Every time I see your face
It makes me feel I'm so alive
I'm so hypocrite
I regret then forget
Don't want to throw away the gift of my life
Forget me now for not trying
Forget me now for being a dept
