Walking down the street
In a sea of faces
Just trying to find out
Where my place is
I swear I just don't know
Which way that I should go
Sometimes I think
That I just can't stand it
Feels like a dropped in
From another planet
This world has so much madness
Disguised in eyes of sadness

Truth is lost upon the masses
People wear sunglasses
In the dark
Ice is running through their veins
But I ain't taking novocaine
For my heart

Why it gotta be like that?
Why it gotta be?
Why it gotta be like that?
I just can't help but question why
Somebody tell me...
Why it gotta be like that?
Why it gotta be?
Why it gotta be like that?
Some dreams will live and some will die

So many live in mental poverty
While they watch a bad reality
Their spirts going blind
A vacant state of mind
It's time the people opened up their eyes
This revolution will be televised
I've got to find a way
I'm praying every day

Truth is lost upon the masses
People wear sunglasses
In the dark
Ice is running through their veins
But I ain't taking novocaine
For my heart

Why it gotta be like that?
Why it gotta be?
Why it gotta be like that?
I just can't help but question why
Somebody tell me...
Why it gotta be like that?
Why it gotta be?
Why it gotta be like that?
Some dreams will live and some will die

Truth is lost upon the masses
People wear sunglasses
In the dark
Ice is running through their veins
But I ain't taking novocaine
For my heart

Why it gotta be like that?
Why it gotta be?
Why it gotta be like that?
I just can't help but question why
Somebody tell me...
Why it gotta be like that?
Why it gotta be?
Why it gotta be like that?
Some dreams will live and some will die
