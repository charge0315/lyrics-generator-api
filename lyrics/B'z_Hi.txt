Beside yourself if radio's gonna stay
Reason, it could polish up the gray
Put that, put that, put that in your wall
That this isn't country at all

Raving station
Beside yourself

Keep me out of country in the word
Deal the foreigners into the absurd
Don't let's, don't let's, don't let's call you far
That they're pushing foreigners too far

Straight off the boat
Where to go?

Callin' on in transit
Callin' on in transit
Radio Free Europe
Radio

Beside defying media too fast
Instead of pulling, carving up the fault
Push that, push that, push that up your wall
That this isn't nothing at all

Raving station
Beside yourself

Callin' on in transit
Callin' on in transit
Radio Free Europe
Radio Free Europe

Beside yourself
Callin' all, it's callin' all
Callin' all of those

Keep me out of country in the word
Reason, it could follow up absurd

Straight off the boat
Where to go?

Callin' on in transit
