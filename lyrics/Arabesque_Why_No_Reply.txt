Hold the line, hold the line)
(Hold the line, hold the line)
A cosy room on a summer night
There's no-one here to hold me tight
The sun goes down, I'm feeling blue
So once again I'm calling you
Over and over I'm trying and trying my love
Over and over I'm trying and trying
To tell you I'm crying for love
Why no reply?
You know who's calling
Why no reply?
The night is falling
I want your lips close to mine
Why no reply?
I need you badly
Why no reply?
Why don't you let me
Be close to you, tell me why
(Hold the line, hold the line)
(Hold the line, hold the line)
You are so near and far away
Don't wanna hear what I have to say
Now that I'm lonely, you close your door
I love you only, but what for
Over and over I'm trying and trying my love
Over and over I'm trying and trying
To tell you I'm crying for love
Why no reply?
You know who's calling
Why no reply?
The night is falling
I want your lips close to mine
Why no reply?
I need you badly
Why no reply?
Why don't you let me
Be close to you, tell me why
(Hold the line, hold the line)
(Hold the line, hold the line)
(Hold the line, hold the line)
Why no reply?
You know who's calling
Why no reply?
The night is falling
I want your lips close to mine
Why no reply?
I need you badly
Why no reply?
Why don't you let me
Be close to you, tell me why
