It's a bit early in the midnight hour for me
To go through all the things that I wanna be
I don't believe in everything I see
You know I'm blind so why d'you disagree?

Take me away 'cause I just don't wanna stay
And the lies you make me say are getting deeper every day
These are crazy days but they make me shine
Time keeps rolling by

All around the world, you gotta spread the word
Tell 'em what you've heard, we're gonna make a better day
All around the world, you gotta spread the word
Tell 'em what you've heard, you know it's gonna be okay

What you gonna do when the walls come falling down?
You never move, you never make a sound
And where you gonna swim with the riches that you found?
If you're lost at sea, well, I hope that you drowned

Take me away 'cause I just don't wanna stay
And the lies you make me say are getting deeper every day
These are crazy days but they make me shine
Time keeps rolling by

All around the world, you gotta spread the word
Tell 'em what you heard, we're gonna make a better day
And all around the world, you gotta spread the word
Tell 'em what you heard, you know it's gonna be okay

Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na

Tell 'em what you heard, we're gonna make a better day
'Cause all around the world, we gotta spread the word
Tell 'em what you heard, you know it's gonna be okay

Tell 'em what you've heard, we're gonna make a better day
And all around the world, you gotta spread the word
Tell 'em what you've heard, you know it's gonna be okay

It's gonna be okay
