Schmit
I'm just a whilte boy from Sacramento
I'm not too funky, or so I'm told
I'm on the level - I'm incognito
I'm just a white boy from Sacramento
I went to school in the shiny suburbs
I heard young Pat Boone on my radio
Grew up on TV - I still love Lucy
Drank Pepsi-Cola, and did the stroll
Went to the barber - he cut my flattop
I rode my red bike straight on home
Put on my Jade East, went to a party
We did the limbo - we got real low
I dig surf music 'cuz it's so bitchin'
I think the Kingston Trio is so hip
I close my eyes and I feel so groovy
I shake my head while I bite my lip
I hit them high notes like they were nothin'
I sing them love songs so soft and fine
So if you wanna feel warm and fuzzy
I whisper, "Love will keep us all alive"
You know the governor - the Terminator
You know there's nothing he can't do
And he's as strong as an alligator
Now he's from Sacramento too
I'm just a whilte boy from Sacramento
I'm not too funky, so bless my soul
I'm on the level - there's one thing I know
I'm just a white boy from Sacramento
Whatever I do, wherever I go
I'm still a white boy from Sacramento
{Spoken:}
Get down! Be groovy! Now limbo!
I'm just a white, white, white, white, white boy!
Yeah - you know what I mean. You know, up there in the capital...
Get down
Alright, this one, here we go, that's it!
