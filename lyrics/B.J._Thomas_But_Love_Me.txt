Do me wrong, do me right
Do me anything you might
But love me, love me
Just love me
Tell me lies, treat me cruel
Call me nothin' but a fool
But love me, love me
Babe, love me
I've been waitin' for an angel like you to appear
All of my life I been dreamin' and holdin' you nearly
So do me wrong, do me right
Do me anything you might
But love me, love me
Babe, love me
Maybe I'm just a fool
But what can I do?
I've got a sweet tooth, honey
It's achin' for you
So do me wrong, do me right
Do me anything you might
But love me, love me
Babe, love me
But love me with a love -
With a love that's real
Love me with a love that I can feel
Do, do, do... but love me
Do me wrong, do me right
Do me anything you might
But love me, love me
Babe, love me
Tell me lies, treat me cruel
Call me nothin' but a fool
But love me, love me
Babe, love me
Do me wrong, do me right
Do me anything you might
But love me, love me
Babe, love me
