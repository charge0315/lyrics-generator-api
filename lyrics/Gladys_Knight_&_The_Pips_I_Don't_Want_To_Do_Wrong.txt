Mm, I don't wanna do wrong
But you've been gone, baby, so long
And I hope, I hope you'll understand
That it's really, it's really, oh, yes, it is
It's out of my hands

But I don't wanna do wrong, I don't wanna do wrong
(But it's been so long) Oh, it's been so long
(I just can't help myself) No
(No, no, no) Mmm

Since you been away (Since you've been away)
I've been prayin' everyday (I've been prayin' everyday)
For God to make me strong 'til you get back home (Oh, ooh)
No, no, no, no, I don't wanna do
But my heart keeps tellin' me to (Oh, ooh)
And though I've tried with all my might
Uh huh, I think I've lost this fight

(I don't wanna do wrong) I don't wanna do wrong
(But it's been so long) Oh-oh, it's been so long
(I just can't help myself)
I just can't, I just can't, no (No, no, no)

Oh, yeah
No, I don't wanna
No, I didn't wanna do it
Oh, ooh, oh

But then again, my dear
Time passed and I didn't hear
A comforting word from you to make me see
That you were still in love with me (Oh, ooh)
So if by chance you've found another girl
Love her and I wish you all the happiness in the world (Oh, ooh)
'Cause I've found a new love that I can't break loose
I hope I can find happiness too

(I don't wanna do wrong) I don't wanna do wrong
(But it's been so long) Oh, it's been so long
(I just can't help myself) No no, no no
(No, no, no) No, no, no
I don't wanna do wrong
(But it's been so long) Oh, baby, baby, baby
(I just can't help myself) I just can't, I just can't
(No, no, no) I just can't, I just can't, I just can't
(I don't wanna do wrong) I don't wanna do wrong
(But it's been so long) Oh, baby, baby, baby
(I just can't help myself) I just can't, I just can't, I just can't
(No, no, no) Woah oh
