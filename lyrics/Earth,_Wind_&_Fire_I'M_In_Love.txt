Alone again like an empty shell
Feeling like I wanna die
I've been through hell
So easy to be crushed
By someone you love so much
Then you came along
And picked me up and took me home
So tenderly you held me in your arms
You said "Baby, dry your eyes
There's no need to cry"

I'm in love once again
Yes, it's true I love you
With you, my love
I'm in love once again
Yes, it's true I love you
With all my heart
There I was
Washed up on a shore
Crying my heart out
I just can't take no more
My life had come to an end
I was ready to give in
I closed my eyes
In one last silent prayer
Only to look up
And find you standing there
I looked into your eyes
And then I realized
(Chorus)
I'm in love once again
Yes, it's true I love you
With you, my love
I'm in love once again
Yes, it's true I love you
And this is why I feel
Because you never (never give up on your dreams)
Never give up on your dreams
I'm in love
I'm in love once again
Yes, it's true I love you
With you, my love
Heaven only knows
Just how good it feels
To be right here with you
Heaven only knows
Just the joy I feel
'Cause here's where I belong
That's why I never
I never gave up on you
I never, I never gave up on
Coming home back to you
(Chorus & ad lib out)
