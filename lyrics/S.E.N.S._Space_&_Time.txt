So everybody thinks they know about me
But I promise theres a side that you don't see
Yeah theres a side that you don't see
Now I know that you wanna fight me
I'm chill guy and I just want some piece
Baby I just want some peace
Every morning I see Charlie and my cup
Get some tea, gotta keep myself up
I just gotta drink my tea
But now my minds fogged up
And I think I'm kinda stuck
Yo, I been feeling like my time's up

Yo, this shit is crazy and I been thinkin' lately
About the dumb little stuff that I do on the daily
It doesn't really phase me but I been feelin' lazy
Yo Nick, can you add some more percussion
I'm stuck in routine
6 Months of quarantine
I'm sipping ovaltinе
Momma thinks I'm turning mean
So let me sеt the scene
Feel like I'm 17
Them last years I was living with my family
Nah, I'm chillin, 2020, shit is funny
Covid Easter, sorry bunny
I'm just trynna get this money, honey
But now the clock is ticking
And I don't know what I'm missing
Better listen, life is kickin
Need to find a pot to piss in

So everybody thinks they know about me
But I promise theres a side that you don't see
Yeah theres a side that you don't see
Now I know that you wanna fight me
I'm chill guy and I just want some piece
Baby I just want some peace
Every morning I see Charlie and my cup
Get some tea, gotta keep myself up
I just gotta drink my tea
But now my minds fogged up
And I think I'm kinda stuck
Yo, I been feeling like my time's up
