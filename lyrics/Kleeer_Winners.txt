You win, and then celebrate
Kiss the sky (kiss the sky)
You lose the blue human trade
No reply (no reply)
And home alone, contemplate
Got to try (got to try)
Return to burn, feeling great
I know why (I know why, because)

Winners never quit (quitters never win)
I said winners never quit, no, no (quitters never win)
You know winners never quit, no (quitters never win)
Winners never quit (quitters never win)

No, no, no, no (no)
No, no, no, no

Again you win, glad you came
Brand new race (brand new race)
The price is nice, feel no pain
Love the taste (love the taste)
You bluff enough, one more game
Had no ace (had no ace)
The laugh, your stuff brought to fame
Set the pace (set the pace, because)

Winners never quit (quitters never win)
I said winners never quit, no, no (quitters never win)
Winners never quit, no (quitters never win)
You know winners never quit (quitters never win)

No, no, no, no
No, no, no, no

Guys before the test, keep your eye, there's nothing left
We are winners
Ooh yeah, yeah, yeah, ooh yeah
