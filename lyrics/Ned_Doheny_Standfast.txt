Standfast
Don't you let them pull you down
That is something you can do
You got to reach out
We have all the power of no other
Tears have chained you
Maybe love can pull you through
Standfast
Leave your baggage by the sea
Find some other way to go
You're on your own now
And your feet have got you homing
It's never easy
When you love everybody so
You better make the best of it
You may not have it twice
Now won't you please get off your knees
And wipe those tears out of your eyes
Ooh, you got to standfast
While the heavens gather light
Let the darkness slip away
Just let it go, babe
There's no need for conversation
Words can't save you
When you've already known the way
Ooh, you got to stand
Ooh-la-coo-coo
Ooh, you got to stand
That's what you must do
Ooh, you got to stand
Ooh-la-coo-coo
Ooh, you got to stand
Wo-wo
Ooh, you got to stand
That's what you must do
Ooh, you got to stand
Ooh, you got to stand
Ooh, you got to stand
Ooh, you got to stand
Wo-wo
Ooh, you got to stand
