'S wonderful, 's marvelous
You should care for me
'S awfully nice, 's paradise
'S what I love to see
You've made my life so glamorous
You can't blame me for feeling amorous
Oh, 's wonderful, marvelous
That you should care for me
'S wonderful, 's marvelous
That you should care for me
'S awful nice, 's paradise
'S what I love to see
My dear, it's four-leaf clover time
From now on my heart's working overtime
Oh, 's wonderful, marvelous
That you should care for me
'S wonderful, 's marvelous
That you should care for me
'S awfully nice, 's paradise
'S what I love to see
You've made my life so glamorous
You can't blame me for feeling amorous
Oh, 's wonderful, marvelous
That you should care for me
