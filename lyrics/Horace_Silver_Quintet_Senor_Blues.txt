Señor Blues is what they call him
Way down Mexicali way
Señoritas fallin' for him
With the hope that he will stay
By the time that they love him
Señor Blues done gone away

Well, he's tall and good lookin'
And he always knows just what to say
Yes, he's tall and good lookin'
And he always knows just what to say
By the time that they love him
Señor Blues done gone away

I don't know why, don't know why, don't know why
I'm a wandering, wandering guy
With no one gal to lay my head by
Ooh, I'm so tired and lonely and blue
'Cause the one gal that I love won't be true
Got the blues and it's all 'cause of you
Got the blues and it's all 'cause of you
