Woke up with yawning, It's dawning
I'm still alive
Turned on my radio
To start up new day
As goddamned DJ chattered
How to survive
Amazing news got over
On that air wave

Tonight, love is rationed
Tonight, across the nation
Tonight, love reflects worldwide
Almost another day

Woke up with yawning, It's dawning
I'm still alive
Turned on my radio
To start up new day
As goddamned DJ chattered
How to survive
Amazing news got over
On that air wave

Tonight, love is rationed
Tonight, across the nation
Tonight, love reflects worldwide
Almost another day
Almost another day

She's a shooting star, good night, good night
She's a shooting star, good bye

Tonight, love is rationed
Tonight, across the nation
Tonight, love reflects worldwide
Tonight, love is rationed
Tonight, across the nation
Tonight, love reflects worldwide
Almost another day
See you some other day
