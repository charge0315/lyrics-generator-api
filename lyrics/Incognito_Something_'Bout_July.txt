What would you do if you were me? I caught a glimpse of what could be
I can't explain the way I feel, but I am certain that it’s real. It’s real
Forget tomorrow and love me now, abandoned dreams that that once belonged
There’s no more doubts inside my head tonight
When I didn't think that anything would ever turn out right
There’s something ‘bout July, she changed the scene all in one day
There’s something ‘bout July, I took to her right away
Something ‘bout July
Something wonderful about July
Just how all this has come to be, I don’t know how and I don’t know why, oh why?
I’m like a teenage driver at the lights, I just can’t wait, I just can’t wait to be movin’ on
Forget tomorrow and love me now, abandoned dreams that that once belonged
When I look back at the way it used to be
When I didn't think that anything would turn out right
I know it's only the beginning and time's not ever what it seems
Don’t want to shake this early feelin’, I feel that she is here to stay
July, July…
Something about that girl
July…
What would you do if you were me? Caught a glimpse of something that could be
Something about the way she makes me feel
She changed the scene all in one day
Something about her got me right away
Hey there girl listen…
Forget tomorrow and love me now
