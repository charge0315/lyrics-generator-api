Oh, whoa, da-da-da
Ah-ey

I had to escape
The city was sticky and cruel
Maybe I should have called you first
But I was dying to get to you
I was dreaming while I drove
The long straight road ahead, uh-huh, yeah

Could taste your sweet kisses, your arms open wide
This fever for you is just burning me up inside

I drove all night to get to you
Is that alright? (Is that alright?)
I drove all night
Crept in your room
Woke you from your sleep
To make love to you
Is that alright? (Is that alright?)
I drove all night

What in this world keeps us from falling apart?
No matter where I go, I hear the beating of our one heart
I think about you when the night is cold and dark, uh-huh, yeah
No one can move me the way that you do
Nothing erases this feeling between me and you, oh

I drove all night to get to you
Is that alright? (Is that alright?)
I drove all night
Crept in your room
Woke you from your sleep
To make love to you
Is that alright? (Is that alright?)
I drove all night

I taste your sweet kisses, your arms open wide
This fever for you is just burning me up inside

I drove all night to get to you
Is that alright (Is that alright?)
I drove all night
Crept in your room
Is that alright?
I drove all night

(I drove all night) I drove all night
(To get to you) To get to you
(Is that alright?) Is that alright?
(I drove all night) I drove all night
(Crept in your room) Crept in your room
(Is that alright?) Is that alright?
I drove all night
