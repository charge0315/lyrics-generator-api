Does it seem like
Like sometimes this life ain't what it seems?
Know what I mean?
When you dream at night
Does it feel like you are in between?
Caught in the beam

Mirror reflection of a boy and girl
The intersection of another world

What have we seen?
What have we done?
What have we done?
Can I really be the only one?
Can I be the only one under the sun?

Yes, the only one
Can I be--
The one and only one!
The only one

Train goes off the track
Chain reaction latched the casket closed
Petals of rose
Stop and wind it back
Is it faster than the path you chose?
Nobody knows I suppose

Mirror reflection of a boy and girl
The intersection of another world

What have we seen?
What have we done?
What have we done?
Can I really be the only one?
Can I be the only one under the sun?

How can I be the only one?
How can I be the only one?

What have we seen?
What have we done?
What have we done?
Can I really be the only one?
Can I be the only one under the sun?

Yes, the only one
Can I be--
The one and only one!
The only one

Like, let's split two shots between us two
And I need a pint because I don't have a rubberband
