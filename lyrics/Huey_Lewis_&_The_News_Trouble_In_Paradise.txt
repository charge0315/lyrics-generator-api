Billy's home, he just back from L.A
Plenty of lines but nothing to say
Seen this movie and it don't end nice
Looks like trouble in paradise
He used to be cool he used to laugh a lot
Down at the brothers in the parking lot
Now he's sick, and he's scared, and he's paying the price

Trouble in paradise (Trouble in paradise)
Mama said he always was so nice
(Trouble in paradise)

American son, he's not very old
An American dream that's never been sold
The smile on his face is just his last disguise
We've got trouble in paradise
There's a scream inside that shouts "Here I am"
Some people say we've got to do all we can
Me, I don't know, you see, I've been there myself once or twice

Trouble in paradise (Trouble in paradise)
Mama said he always was so nice
(Trouble in paradise)
I'm in trouble, I'm in trouble

(Trouble in paradise)
Mama said he always was so nice
(Trouble in paradise)
I'm in trouble, I'm in trouble

(Trouble in paradise)
(Trouble in paradise)
(Trouble in paradise)
(Trouble in paradise)
(Trouble in paradise)
