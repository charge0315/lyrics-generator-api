Feelin', happy feelin'
In the music that we're givin'
Feel the power every hour
Every moment that we're livin'
Little babies, tell the story
Mother Nature and its glory
Share the feelin' with your brother
Don't stop carin' one another, alright
Little babies, tell the story
Mother Nature and its glory
Share the feelin' with your brother
Don't stop carin' one another
There's a reason that we're pleasing
What you're yearnin' life's a burnin'
In the music hear the message
All the feelin' is a blessin', oh yeah
Ooh feelin', feelin'
Happy feelin', feelin' feelin' feelin'
Feelin' feelin'
Yeah, yeah yeah
Yeah, yeah yeah
Make ya groove
