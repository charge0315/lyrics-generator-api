Down where Egypt lies
The river Nile flows
Far beyond the gates of Jericho
Lashambeaux, oh
Said he I can't sleep at night
My dreams are not my own
So I tossed and turned
While shadows burned
I walked the streets alone
Swallowed like some love-struck heartache
When the drums are still
Call me to the west
Call me to the west
Although he flashed by, bent to win
His heart upon the trail
Though the world loves a bloody joke
True love's a fairy tale
Some folks think he's lying
But me I know he's true
And if that out the fire
We claim as power
Eternity will do
We are clinging to the self-same moment
As the leopard's pangs
God will mend his wings
God will mend his wings
God will mend his wings
God will mend his wings
Farewell Lashambeaux
Why don't you take your dreams to Jericho
Oh, oh ours will be the first to go
Just standing round and round
Rachel, lift your eyes
You mustn't lose the thread
'Cause there's a world above
This push and shove
Or so I say it's there
As he waited for us all to follow
Mother dry your eyes
He will surely rise
He will surely rise
He will surely rise
He will surely rise
Lashambeaux, Lashambeaux
Lashambeaux, Lashambeaux
Lashambeaux, Lashambeaux
Lashambeaux, Lashambeaux
Lashambeaux
The pain will put you down
Tell the story
(Lashambeaux)
The pain will put you down
(Lashambeaux)
Tell the story
Lashambeaux, Lashambeaux
Lashambeaux, Lashambeaux
Lashambeaux, Lashambeaux...
