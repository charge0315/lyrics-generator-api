The tide is high but I'm holding on
I'm gonna be your number one
I'm not the kinda man who gives up just like that
No
It's not the things you do that really hurts me bad
But it's the way you do the things you do to me
I'm not the kinda man who gives up just like that
No
The tide is high but I'm holding on
I'm gonna be your number one
Number one
Number one
Every man wants you to be his girl
But I'll wait, my dear, 'til it's my turn
I'm not the kinda man who gives up just like that
No
Every man wants you to be his girl
But I'll wait, my dear, 'til it's my turn
I'm not the kinda man who gives up just like that
No
The tide is high but I'm holding on
I'm gonna be your number one
The tide is high but I'm holding on
I'm gonna be your number one
The tide is high but I'm holding on
I'm gonna be your number one
