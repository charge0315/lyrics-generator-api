Can I borrow your hand?
Tell me when you need it back
And I'll personally thank you for the chance
I'm modest, honestly
Can I make it back? Probably
I'm just hoping that you ask for that

And if I hold onto this
I know that it's right for me
That's alright, don't you see?

I wanted to find some sleep
I know that it's been a while
I'm giving it all of me, but
Still like half the time, I'm
Running in circles
Creating a space I crave
Watch me make my great escape
Leaving a trail of simple shapes

(Oh-ooh, ooh)
Leaving a trail of simple shapes

Will I see you again?
I don't wanna make pretend
Even though I know
You're with me in my head

And if I hold onto this
I know that it's right for me
That's alright, don't you see?
(Don't you? Don't you?
Don't you? Don't you?)

I wanted to find some sleep
I know that it's been a whilе
I'm giving it all of me, but
Still like half the timе, I'm
Running in circles
Creating a space I crave
Watch me make my great escape
Leaving a trail of simple shapes

(Oh-ooh, ooh)
Leaving a trail of simple shapes
Ooh-woah-ooh
