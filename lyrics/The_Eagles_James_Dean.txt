Yeah, yeah, ayo

The underground done came alive and crawled up out the well
All you saw was scorched terrain and water up for sale
This for woke bitches who did it and didn’t kiss 'n' tell
This for coke sniffers dippin’ into this with fingernails
Rip the cap off the boot polish and pour the liquid in
Ravens Oil tattoos top to bottom the ridgie’s skin
Could of ended up as an addict or even in the clink
I guess the way I’m living through these bars ain’t a coincidink
I heard you bought the kitchen sink and change for your snow bunny
Living at high speeds is guaranteed to slow the money
Why I choose to keep the same hunger as them homeless folk
'Cause that ain’t what your mentors meant when they told you go for broke
Snappin' like the neck of Jeffrey Ep', still I show you the ropes, and better yet
Only item left was this open note
Khakis are Carharrt, car keys are coke dipped
When Crooky had the Mercedes, none of the paper came from Dada
A product of the '80s, had some ladies going gaga
The first line of the verse, well, I consider this the hard part
But once I get the car start, manoeuvre like a maniac
'Cause tryna navigate through this industry, that’s the dark art
We headed right in the dead of night, zombies shooting up
We’re used to seeing dirty fits, them dirty fits is used to us
Handle black jeeps down back streets we used to bus
'Stead of holding in traffic, we bag it till the Uber comes

The rules
The rules
The rules to the game are simple, win
“The wind get the ashes in the end, bro”

(Whoop whoop) I’m Lucky Luciano over looped piano
From the commission flats to the television screens
Feel like the truth of today is more than the youth can handle
(Golden Rule) Take the fuckin’ cake 'fore they blow out ya candles
Ninety per cent will get a spark, but it doesn’t last
Spend the rest of their limited years living in the past
Looking for answers in the bottom of their whiskey glass
But no sixteens is getting in between this thing of ours
Whoa now, don’t know how to slow down
Dried up all my tears, I can sell a slug salt now
Hold down the fort for the spitters from the old town
Told me how the very thing that’s driving you's bound to be the demise of you

The rules
The rules
The rules, peep the hidden jewels, the errands of fools
Class is back in session for those talking out of school (Mad idea)

Ayo, the end ain’t that far from the entrance
Time don’t fly, and we can’t make, take, or spend it
But it will make fools of those who’s tryna play God, and so
Bear witness,  swear, we livin’ for cuttin’ it close
So when it all falls apart or down, we gon’ be alright
And if all I can change is your mind, then that’s enough
Nothin’ survivin’ the cycle of build and destroy
But, for now, it ain’t nothin’ nice, but my boy
Make peace with it
