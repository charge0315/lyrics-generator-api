Ahhhhh, ahhh-ah
Dil cheez kya hai
Aap meri jaan lijiye
Ahhhhh, ahhh-ah
Dil cheez kya hai
Aap meri jaan lijiye

We saw the holy men come in from Sanchi
We touched their souls and heard the Martyrs crying
Among the fields of red, we took the strange brew
The windless sky Diwali moon were calling to me
The deeper I go, the higher I fly with you

You take my breath away
Oh, you
You take my breath away
Oh, you
You take my breath away
Oh, you
You take my breath away
Oh, you (Oh, you)
You take my breath away
Oh, you (Oh, you)
You take my breath away
Oh, you
