Skyline seems to disappear
When you're lonely in New York
Sidewalks don't lead anywhere
When you're lonely in New York
Rush hour traffic not a soul around
The echo of your heartbeat makes the only sound
Broadway is a dead end street
When you're lonely in New York

Rockefeller Center doesn't rock
When you're lonely in New York
Central Park, just a parking lot
When you're lonely in New York
The lady with the torch is your one and only friend
In the city that never sleeps your nightmare never ends
You'd trade Manhattan for a string of beads
When you're lonely in New York

Rockefeller Center doesn't rock
When you're lonely in New York
Oh, Central Park, just a parking lot
When you're lonely in New York
The lady with the torch is your one and only friend
In the city that never sleeps your nightmare never ends
You'd trade Manhattan for a string of beads
When you're lonely in New York
I say you'd trade Manhattan for a string of beads
When you're lonely in New York
