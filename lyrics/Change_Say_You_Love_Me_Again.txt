So far away
Say you love me again
I need to hear
So far away
Say you love me again
I need you here

Give me assurance
You're so far away
Tell me that you're thinking of me
It would bring me a little closer if heard you say
I love you
Over and over to me

So far away
Say you love me again
I need to hear
(Say you love me again)
So far away
Say you love me again
I need you here

You can be sure that while I'm away
I'm lonely, always thinking of you
Rushing to return to be by your side
So I can hear "I love you" whispered in my ear

So far away
Say you love me again
I need to hear
(I need to hear)
So far away
Say you love me again
I need you here
(And, oh, baby)

It's been two days since I held you
And it seems like such a long time
You never miss what you got until it's gone
And so far away, you are
And I need you to hold me close
In your loving arms
But when it's impossible, "I love you" will do

So far away
I miss you, baby
Baby, you know I miss you, too
You've been away for so long
It's been too long, too long
When are you coming back?
Well, as soon as I can
'Cause you know I love you, and you love me
And I love you, and you love me, too
Yes
So far away
Say you love me again
I love you, baby
