I don't like this picture, things don't add up
He's got you blinded, I can tell from the jump
That story he sold you, I can write out a lie
'Cause I know, I know this kind of guy

No, you're totally wrong about him, he's a good guy
And I love him

Don't you see what you're saying? The excuses you make?
I'm tryna tell you he's a big mistake
With no past, there's no future, gotta look in his eye
'Cause I know, I know this kind of guy

Oh, it's the same old thing
You can feel it in your blood
When a lie gets under your skin
You know no one's gonna win
Damn fool love

I know this is gonna sound crazy, but I think he beat the shit out of Jason in high school

That's insane, no, he didn't

I swear to God he did, I saw him do it
Which mеans he is way older than he says hе is, among other major problems
The second of which is that you are dating a wacko who put Jason in the hospital

Why are we talking about Jason?!

God knows what he told you, but I know who he is
God knows how it happened, but I know that was him
You'll be back on my shoulder, I'll be drying your eyes
'Cause I know, I know this kind of guy

Oh, it's that same old thing
You can feel it in your blood
When a lie gets under your skin
You know no one's gonna win

I swear to God, he was at Chelsea's party a decade ago and I still remember it

When a lie gets under your skin
When a lie gets under your skin
You know no one's gonna win
Damn fool love
