I'm laying here, I'm wondering
When I'm gonna be wrapped up in your arms again
It's almost like eternity
'Cause seconds feel like hours when you're gone from me

Baby, even though you were just by my side
I'm so missin' you, yeah yeah
And I know that I have you to myself
When you come home

And it seems like days go by
It feels like I'm so lost without you
And I don't really know what to do
The hands of time
Won't move when I'm away from you
And I don't really know what to do

I try to wait patiently
But everything is taking way too long, and I
I just wanna be with you
I'm trying to see it through
It's not fair

Don't wanna be alone another day
It's just too miserable, it's true
And baby, I have learned
When you're far away, time stands still

And it seems like days go by
It feels like I'm so lost without you
And I don't really know what to do
The hands of time
Won't move when I'm away from you
And I don't really know what to do
Days go by
It feels like I'm so lost without you
And I don't really know what to do
The hands of time
Won't move when I'm away from you
And I don't really know what to do

And it seems like days go by
It feels like I'm so lost without you
And I don't really know what to do
The hands of time
Won't move when I'm away from you
And I don't really know what to do
Days go by
It feels like I'm so lost without you
And I don't really know what to do
The hands of time
Won't move when I'm away from you
And I don't really know what to do
