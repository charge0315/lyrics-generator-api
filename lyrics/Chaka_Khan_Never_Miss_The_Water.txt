Never miss, never miss the
(You never miss the water till it's gone)
All is fair in love boy
When the love is shared, yeah
Now you've been acting for some time
Like you just don't care
About me
Well my mama used to say
There would come a day
When fools begin to open up their eyes...
Chorus:
Never miss the water
Till the well runs dry
Now I have had enough bad love
So I'm telling you goodbye (bye bye bye)
(You never miss the water till it's gone)
You've been taking me for granted
You even make me cry, yeah
And sorry just ain't good enough
Baby not this time, no no no
Well my mama used to say
There would come a day
When the truth can no longer be denied...
Never miss the water
Till the well runs dry
I have had enough bad love
I'm telling you goodbye...
Me'shell:
Hmm, some of you lies when love has gone
Maybe never been but it's time to move on
Now lookie here, you never miss the till it's gone baby, yeah
You got step back, 'cause if you don't care, there's no need
No need to be there
My heart no longer cries out for you
Looking for a love that's true
Tell me what cha' gonna do for me?
Come on, step back, once too blind to see
Come on and step back, you never miss the water till it's gone
Whoa
Chorus (2)
(You never miss the water till it's gone)
You never miss the water
You never miss the water
Till the well is dry
(You never miss the water till it's gone)
You never miss the water
Never till the well is dry
Never till the well is dry
