(Go on and fuck yourself)
(Go on and fuck yourself)
(Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh)
(Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh)

Watching outer space I see them shine
Crazy stuff like this it blows my mind (Oh, yeah)
So many times, waking up to the radio
I'm breaking out of the safety of radio
When did I stop searching for miracles?
It's bad enough when nobody helps

Memory, memory now
You are nothing but a
Memory, memory now
You are burning out
Washed up all the fight in your eyes
Watch and you can see it is mine
Memory, memory now
Go on and fuck yourself

All you ever do is scream and shout
No one ever knows what it's about (Oh, yeah)
In your mind going straight from the manual
That's so old, so many years ago
So when did I stop searching for miracles?
It's bad enough when nobody helps

You're just a memory, memory now
You are nothing but a
Memory, memory now
You are burning out
Washed up all the fight in your eyes
Watch and you can see it is mine
Memory, memory now
Go on and fuck yourself
(Go on and fuck yourself)

Don't wanna be a has-been
Never gonna happen, not like you
(Go on and fuck yourself)
Don't wanna be a has-been
Never gonna happen, not like you
(Go on and fuck yourself)
Don't wanna be a has-been
Never gonna happen, not like you
(Go on and fuck yourself)
Don't wanna be a has-been
Never gonna happen, not like you
Don't wanna be a has-been
Never gonna happen, not like you

Memory, memory now
You are nothing but a
Memory, memory now
You are burning out
Washed up all the fight in your eyes
Watch and you can see it is mine
Memory, memory now
Go on and fuck yourself
Go on and fuck yourself
