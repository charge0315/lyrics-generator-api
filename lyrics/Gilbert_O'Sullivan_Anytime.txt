Anytime you need a friend
Anytime you're at an end
Call on me and I'll be there with you
Just my luck if you don't want me to
Don't leave me in a spin
You know the state I'm in too
Anytime, anytime, anytime will do
Anytime your heart is sad
Anytime you're feeling bad
Say the word and I'll be on my way
Just my luck if I'm not home that day
It doesn't have to be
Now and forever it's true
Anytime, anytime, anytime will do
What's the use of me
Pretending I'm with you
When all I get is in effect
What in effect I knew
Don't keep me anymore
Although I'm longing for you
Anytime, anytime, anytime will do
What's the use of me
Pretending I'm with you
When all I get is I suspect
What I suspect I knew
Anytime you need a friend
Anytime you're at an end
Call on me and I'll be at your side
Just my luck if it should be denied
Don't leave me in a spin
You know the state I'm in too
It doesn't have to be
Now and forever it's true
Don't keep me anymore
When all I want is want you
Anytime, anytime, anytime will do
Anytime, anytime, anytime will do
