Blond and broad and six feet talt
Knowing I was gonna fall
For your smile
For your smile
I didn't try to run away
No, I simply had to stay
For your smile
For your smile
You came close
So close to me
I had no chance to say no
'Cause your smile
Your smile at me
Until I let myself go
For your smile
I'd like my life again
You are the only man
Who made it so worth while
For your smile
I'd throw myself away
If only you would stay
To look at me and smile
I'm feeling fine, I'm feeling well
Baby since the day I feel
For your smile
For your smile
You had planned it from the start
I would gladly give my heart
For your smile
For your smile
When you're close
So close to me
I will never say no
Only smile
Your smile at me
Until I let myself go
For your smile
I'd like my life again
You are the only man
Who made it so worth while
For your smile
I'd throw myself away
If only you would stay
To look at me, look at me and smile
For your smile
I'd like my life again
You are the only man
Who made it so worth while
For your smile
I'd throw myself away
If only you would stay
To look at me and smile
For your smile
I'd like my life again
You are the only man
Who made it so worth while
For your smile
I'd throw myself away
If only you would stay
To look at me and smile
For your smile
I'd like my life again
You are the only man
Who made it so worth while
For your smile
I'd throw myself away
If only you would stay
To look at me and smile
