I will be your Super Hero
But U must understand
If I'm 2 be your Super Hero
U must give me half a chance
I am born unto poverty and fear
I am scorned yet I hold back my tears
There's so much I can and will and want 2 do
But I cannot until I get through 2 U
(Chorus)
I am lucky if I learn 2 read and write
Where I live U must first learn 2 stand and fight
I'm the product of the system, I'm aware
What's my name? Don't matter -- nobody cares
(Chorus)
Listen 2 my band
I understand U need me if U ever 2 war
But I don't understand if I buy the goods
Why I can't own the store
Don't tell me that I am not worthy
After 400 years overtime
If it's yours then why can't it be mine?
I am just as good as U or any kind
There's so much I can and will and want 2 do
But I cannot 'til I get through 2 U
(Chorus)
Listen 2 my band
Give us what U give your brothers
Then U'll understand
I won't be your Super Hero
'Til U give us all U can now -- now!
