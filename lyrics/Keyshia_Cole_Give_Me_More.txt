Yeah
If you really wanna know
Come on

Never thought you'd be the one to play games the way you did
I gave my heart away to you
Never thought you'd leave the way you did
You meant the world to me
How could you just let me breathe?
Let me go away from you, let me be alone

And you never lied to me, baby
You said you'd always be around (Be around)
Now I need more

(Give me more)
Ooh, what you do for me, ooh, what you do (I want more)
Ooh, what you do for me, and ooh, what you do (I need more)
Ooh, what you do for me, ooh, what you do
(Give me more) Give it to me every day
I need you in every way

So don't stop the way you love me (The way you love me)
I don't wanna look no more (I don't wanna look no more)
(For another) Take me in your arms, understand I'm all for you
Until the end of time (The end of time)
Baby, you'll be mine, ooh-ooh-ooh

And you never lied to me, baby
You said you'd always be around (Be around)
Now I need more

(Give me more)
Ooh, what you do for me, ooh, what you do (I want more)
Ooh, what you do for me, and ooh, what you do (I need more)
Ooh, what you do for me, ooh, what you do
(Give me more) Give it to me every day
I need you in every way

When did you fall? When did it all just go away? (Go away)
When you said that we would never ever see the day (See the day)
I wouldn't wanna be without you and your love (And your love)
I thought we'd always be together, hey

And you never lied to me, baby
You said you'd always be around (Be around)
And now I need more

(Give me more)
Ooh, what you do for me, ooh, what you do (I want more)
Ooh, what you do for me, and ooh, what you do (I need more)
Ooh, what you do for me, ooh, what you do
(Give me more) Give it to me every day
I need you in every way

La di da
La di da da da
La di da (Give me more)
Give it to me every day
I need you in every way
(Give me more)
Give it to me every day
I need you in every way
Ooh, what you do
