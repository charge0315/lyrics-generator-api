I'd fly away with you, baby
Without a fear that they'd catch me
I'm not like all the insects that follow you
But you charmed the trees when you left me
And I found you there lately
But only fine butterflies can fall
The cord on the leaves saves
If you die, it could hurt me
You'd take away all my energy
You'd never know that I loved you
'Cause you'd get away
It can rain on the morning dew
But not the day I look for you
You won't find me around, when it rains
So please, make your way back home
Please, make your way back home to me
Blue butterfly is what I need
Flowers that bloom in day will fade
Before your eyes
Please, make your way back home to me
In my cocoon, you'll find a peace
Blue butterfly is what you see
Within your dreams
You see this world's for the living
Ultraviolet, twelve feet I'm givin'
If I touch you
Would you show me to the blooms?
So you ask why, I fly high
I wanna take you on a ride
On my own, solar powered wing glide
Give me your mind
Give me feed, let me eat you
Let my wings be so full of you
Make my path, the sunlight
I wanna live right
You can float but you can't hide
It's not easy when my flight is right
You won't find me around when there's rain
So please, make your way back home
Please, make your way back home to me
Blue butterfly is what I need
Flowers that bloom in day will fade
Before your eyes
Please, make your way back home to me
In my cocoon, you'll find a peace
Blue butterfly is what you see
Within your dreams
We should make our bed upon the leaves
With your soul in the air
The sun in its glare
There's no way I'll fly alone
