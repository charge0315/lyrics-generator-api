This girl's got me falling in love
And out of my mind
My heart is racing, I'm out of breath
And I'm wasting my time
She's looking at me like she's never seen me running round her head, oh yeah
So will you dance with me
Or do I have to show you how to love instead? (stead, stead)

So let me show you how to love
So let me show you how to love
So let me show you how to love
So let me show you how to love

Woah oh, oh, woah oh, oh
Woah oh, oh, oh
Imma show you how to
Woah oh, oh, woah oh, oh
Woah oh, oh, oh
Imma show you how to

Gimme one chance and I promise that I'll show you the way, oooh
I'll take you far from here and show you how the night turns to day
I can love you better than that other guy who broke your heart
Tell me, tell me, do you love me, baby?
This party's about to start, start, start, start

So let me show you how to love
So let me show you how to love

This party's about to start
Start, start, start
This party's about to start

Woah oh, oh, woah oh, oh
Woah oh, oh, oh
Woah oh, oh, woah oh, oh
Woah oh, oh, oh
Imma show you how to
Woah oh, oh, woah oh, oh
Woah oh, oh, oh
Imma show you how to
Woah oh, oh, woah oh, oh
Woah oh, oh, oh
Imma show you how to love
Woah oh, oh, woah oh, oh

Imma show you how to
Woah oh, oh, woah oh, oh
