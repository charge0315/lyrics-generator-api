It was only yesterday that i was down
And the world was looking cold and lonely
Had a face so long it almost touched the ground
A tear was in my eye I just wanted to cry
But you came and said to me: Don’t look so sad
A smile can make a whole lot happen
And I realized I needed you so bad
It was only yesterday, but I knew right away

Got me breathin’, feelin’
High up in air
Each time i hear you say you care
I’m flying, gliding
High as a kite
‘Cause you brought somethin’ special to my life

It’s a crazy thing you really can’t describe
A moment that will last forever
‘Cause I saw that look of love inside your eyes
My heart just started bumping like the fourth of July
I know I won’t ever be the same again
‘Cause danger’s sitting on my shoulder
It’s a magic feelin’ once you found a friend
‘Cause I know one thing for certain, babe, this love won’t ever end

Got me breathin’, feelin’
High up in air
Each time I hear you say you care
I’m flying, gliding
High as a kite
‘Cause you brought somethin’ special to my life

Don’t need no money, don’t need no fame
‘Cause love’s fallin’ all around like summer rain
I climb a mountain, cross any sea
As long as I know your sugar's waitin’ for me
Want your love, want your love

Got me breathin’, feelin’
High up in air
Each time I hear you say you care
I flying, gliding
High as a kite
‘Cause you brought somethin’ special to my life
Breathin’, feelin’
High up in air
Each time I hear you say you care
I’m flying, gliding
High as a kite
‘Cause you brought somethin’ special to my life
Breathin’, feelin’
High up in air
Each time I hear you say you care
Flying, gliding
High as a kite
‘Cause you brought somethin’ special to my life
