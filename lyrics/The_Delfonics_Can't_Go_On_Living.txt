As I wander through this lonely world
I face each lonely night without you, little girl (Without you)
Oh yeah, as I look out my windowpane
I can't see the sun, fallin' rain
Since you stepped aboard that train (Since you stepped aboard that train)
Oh yeah, baby
I won't give up, until I see your smiling face
Things that could never be replaced, honey, yeah
But I can't go on living, baby
If you stop giving your love to me
Frequently, I long for you desperately
Lord, I can't go on living, mama
If you stop giving your love to me
Listen to me, honey
On the banks of the shore is where I'll be
At the airport, I'll wait patiently for you, little girl (Patiently waiting for you)
Oh yeah, now the sea's softly drifting by
A reflection seems to catch my eye
Was it you, little girl, was it you, baby? (Was it you?)
With a seashell to my ear, listening for your call
If you don't come soon, Lord, I'm gonna end it all, baby
'Cause I can't go on living, mama
If you stop giving your love to me
Frequently, I long for you desperately, baby
Lord, I don't wanna go on without ya
If you stop giving your love to me
With a seashell to my ear, listening for your call
Lord, if you don't come soon, baby, I'm gonna end it all
Yeah, Lord, I don't wanna go on without you, baby
If you stop giving your love to me
Frequently, I long for you desperately, baby
What in the world am I gonna do without you, baby?
Ooh, don't leave me baby
Each and every day of my life, mama
How am I gonna live without you, baby?
Yeah, yeah, if you stop giving your love to me
