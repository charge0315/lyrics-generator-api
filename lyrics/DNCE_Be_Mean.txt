They say you like the torture, honey, but don't forget the whip (Yeah)
My left hand's gettin' loose, but don't let me slip (Yeah)
You say you got some handcuffs, we'll throw out the key (Yeah)
I don't need a safe word, but you don't gotta save me

If pain's what you like
Torture me all night

Make love burnin', love how you keep me hurtin'
So, ooh-ooh, be mean, be mean to me, be mean to me
With that body, you got the right to get naughty
So, ooh-ooh, be mean, be mean to me, be mean to me

You say you gotta be the boss 'cause you pay them bills (Yeah)
There's a brand new position that someone's gotta fill (Pick me)
You say you need a whisper, you wanna hear me scream (Yeah)
Lookin' so smokin', honey, I can barely breathe

If pain's what you like
Torture me all night

Make love burnin', love how you keep me hurtin'
So, ooh-ooh, be mean, be mean to me, be mean to me
With that body, you got the right to get naughty
So, ooh-ooh, be mean, be mean to me, be mean to me

Would you promise that you'll always be mean, be mean to me?
Would you promise that you'll always be mean, be mean to me?

You gotta be mean, baby
Listen up, hey

Gladly, I'll take poison from your lips (From your lips)
Touch you when I burn my fingertips (Ah-ah)
I blame that to love, I must commit
If you want, then I'll submit, if you want, then I'll submit (Ow)

Make love burnin', love how you keep me hurtin'
So, ooh-ooh, be mean, be mean to me, be mean to me
With that body, you got the right to get naughty
So, ooh-ooh, be mean, be mean to me, be mean to me

Would you promise that you'll always be mean, be mean to me?
Would you promise that you'll always be mean, be mean to me?
