You took a mystery and made me want it
You got a pedestal and put me on it
You made me love you out of feeling nothing
Something that you do, ah

And I was there and not dancing with anyone
You took a little, then you took me over
You set your mark on stealing my heart away
Crying, trying, anything for you

I'm in the middle of a chain reaction (Chain reaction)
You give me all the after midnight action (Don't pass me by)
I wanna get you where I can let you make (Share love with me)
All that love to me
I'm on a journey for the inspiration (Inspiration)
To anywhere and there ain't no salvation (Don't make me cry)
I need you to get me nearer to you (Sooner or later)
So you can set me free

We talk about love, love, love
We talk about love
We talk about love, love, love
We talk about love

You make me tremble when your hand moves lower (Love)
You taste a little then you swallow slower (You know it, love)
Nature has a way of yielding treasure
Pleasure made for you, oh

You gotta plan, your future is on the run
Shine a light for the whole world over
You never find your love if you hide away
Crying, dying, all you gotta do is

Get in the middle of a chain reaction (Chain reaction)
You get a medal when you're lost in action (Don't pass me by)
I wanna get your love all ready (Share love with me)
For the sweet sensation, instant radiation
You let me hold you for the first explosion (First explosion)
We get a picture of our love in motion (Don't make me cry)
My arms will cover, my lips will smother you (Sooner or later)
No more left to say

We talk about love, love, love
We talk about love

(Chain reaction)
You let me hold you for the first explosion (Chain reaction)
Arms will cover you
All you gotta do

Get in the middle of a chain reaction (A chain reaction)
You get a medal when you're lost in action (Don't pass me by)
I wanna get your love all ready (Share love with me)
For the sweet sensation, instant radiation (Oh, oh)
You let me hold you for the first explosion (A first explosion)
We get a picture of our love in motion (Don't make me cry)
My arms will cover, my lips will smother you (Sooner or later)
No more left to say (All you gotta do is)

Get in the middle of a chain reaction (Chain reaction, a chain reaction)
You get a medal when you're lost in action (Don't pass me by)
I wanna get your love all ready (Share love with me)
For the sweet sensation, instant radiation (Oh, oh)
You let me hold you for the first explosion (A first explosion)
