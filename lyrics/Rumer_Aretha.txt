I got Aretha
In the morning
High on my headphones and walking to school
I got the blues
In springtime
Cos I know that I'll never have the right shoes

Momma she'd notice but she's always crying
I got no-one to confide in
Aretha nobody but you
And momma she'd notice but she's always fighting
Something in her mind
And it sounds like breaking glass

I tell Aretha
In the morning
High on my headphones and walking to school
I got the blues
In springtime
Cos I know that I'll never have the right shoes

You got the words
Baby you got the words
You got the words
Baby you got the words

Oh Aretha
Aretha I don't wanna go to school
Cos they just don't understand me
And I think the place is cruel
Child
Sing out
Raise your voice
Stand up on your own
Go out there and strike out

I tell Aretha
In the morning
High on my headphones and walking to school
I got the blues
In springtime
Cos I know that I'll never have the right shoes
But I got the words
