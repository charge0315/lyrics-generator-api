An angel appeared
Of the highest One
And Mary believed
The word she received of God's only son
The Virgin rejoiced
Gave thanks to the Lord
And as Joseph dreamt
The angel was sent with tidings of peace and joy
Of the blessed baby boy

They travelled for miles
To reach Bethlehem
Yet when they arrived
No one could provide a place at the inn for them
But God kept them safe
From hurt, harm and danger
And His warm embrace
Away in a manger waiting for Jesus' birth
To glorify the Earth
Then He came

One child can change the world
Christmas Morn'
The King of all kings was born
He reigns forevermore
Let us worship and adore
Christ the Lord

Wondrous star
Led shepherds and wise men
Through valleys and mountains
Angels surrounded them as they travelled far
As a heavenly host
Rang out for the Saviour
The Sweet Prince of peace
Lay majestically asleep glorious and pure
And His mercy endures for always

One child can change the world
Christmas Morn'
The King of all kings was born
He reigns forevermore
Let us worship and adore
Christ the Lord

One child can change the world (oh oh)
Christmas Morn' (on Christmas Morn')
The King of all kings was born (the King of all kings was born)
He reigns (He reigns) forevermore (forevermore)
Let us worship him
Let us worship him
Let us worship
Christ the Lord

One child can change the world
Merry Christmas to all
(Forevermore)
Merry Christmas to all
One child can change the world
Merry Christmas to all
One child can change the world
Merry Christmas to all

This angel appeared
The angel appeared
Christ the Lord
On Christmas Morn'
