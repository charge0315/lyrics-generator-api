No one can save you, nobody wants to 'cause you've gone too far
Sharp as a knife's edge, is the edge of your bed, so in control
You make it seem, it's all a bad dream, you were never told
Oh Sesatia, I wanna save ya, don't be a hard chase, I'm gonna change ya
Your eyes were candy, your flesh was handy to an easy mark
Pearly white necklace, icy cold bracelets, pain and pleasure chains
They were a matched set, it was a bad bet, such a sordid scene
Oh Sesatia, I wanna save ya, don't be a hard case, I'm gonna change ya
Oh Sesatia, I wanna save ya, don't be a hard case, I'm gonna change ya
You took it out one time, but you didn't come back
You think it's just so fine, but it ain't gonna last
(Solo)
They were a matched set, it was a bad bet, such a sordid scene
Oh Sesatia, I wanna save ya, don't be a hard case, I'm gonna change ya
(repeats out)
