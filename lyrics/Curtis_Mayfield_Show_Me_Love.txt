Hey babe
Show me love, show me love
Baby
Show me love, show me love
There's a girl living behind the corner
I got to meet her and I'm gonna
Daddy wanna be your man
Be sure to fit me in your plans
I'm on you like a glove
I guess that I'm in love
No other woman can mean a thing
Baby let me show you what the love will bring
Baby
Show me love, show me love
Baby
Show me love, show me love
When meeting you looked so cool
Don't even know if I can rap that smooth
I got it and I got it bad
Its a feeling that I've never had
Let daddy love you crazy
With a whole lot of sugar gravy
No other woman now can mean a thing
Let me show you baby what I mean
Love, love yeah
Ooh baby
Show me love, show me love
Hey baby
Show me love, show me love
Through the weather whether rain or snow
It would never never be too cold
I'm whining baby on my knees
Baby baby if you please
One way to defy
Is for me to put the action behind
No other woman now can mean a thing
Let me show you baby
Let me show you baby
Love me
Love
Love, love
Love me, love
Love me
Show me, show me
Show me love
Show me love
Show me love
Show me love
Show me love
Show me love
