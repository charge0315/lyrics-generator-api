I said it's crazy in this world, when the knowledge unfurl
How I felt before I met this girl, -thought she wasn't crazy
She was the opposite, and I didn't see it at first
At first, I thought she was far from the worst
But love hurts, when ya' wrong, for how long
Can ya' keep it up and endure the pain, I stay strong
- Cause I knew it would become better with time
Only time can tell, if this girl's forever mine
It's tough with a job and a girl on ya' side
Can't only think about yourself, sleep short nights
Every day like that, I almost can't survive
I live life, but much of my time I have to sacrifice
To but a smile on her face is a pleasure, she's my treasure
We both learned to love each other way better, then before
Now it's some’ ya' can't measure, just can't ignore
Crazy love, hopefully forever we will be together

Crazy love, that’s what it is
Crazy love, that’s what I get
I’m in love with this girl and it’s crazy love
Crazy love, that’s what it is
…and I can’t stop

- It's amazing how my life is changing, next level
-Better than ever, I vanquished the devil
In the land of love-I live, never givin' up
I give love, I never stop, I give it all I got
No doubt that this the right choice, I listen to
My happy inner voice, bright future, no lies spoken
From my mouth to you, I would do anything for you
If I could I would give you the world
No I would give you the whole universe if you asked
You know from day one, you saw my personality unmasked
Forever I stay true to you, I know you do the same for me
When we apart, our hearts bleed, but we're safe when we're
Together, love shines brighter than the brightest star
Still remember the day at the bar, great I got
Ya' number, flirted for 7 months before we started something
Now I know the brighter days are coming, -crazy love

Crazy love, that’s what it is
Crazy love, that’s what I get
I’m in love with this girl and it’s crazy love
Crazy love, that’s what it is
…and I can’t stop
