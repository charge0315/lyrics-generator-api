Sometimes just to see you smile
Would make it all worthwhile
Sometimes just to be with you
Would be all I need
Then I'd have everything
I could ever need
Just to be with you
Is all I ever need
Just to see you smile
Would make it all worthwhile
Sometimes I
I would give anything
To take back all the things I said
That made you cry
Sometimes I
Pretend that I've got everything
Everything in my garden
Everything is so lovely
Think I'll just stop and smell the roses
Stop and smell the roses
Then I think of you
And I don't know where you are
You seem so far away
You're just so far away
And I don't expect to see you again
Sometimes I pretend
That everything in my garden's roses
Everything's so beautiful
