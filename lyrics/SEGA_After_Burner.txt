It's not that I don't know
It's something I don't show
The darker side is better left alone
Be careful what you learn
Be careful; some things burn
True evil exists; you better be concerned
Before you have to face it
They will try and break you
Trick you into losing truth
Deeper within
There has to be conviction
You have to be you
With my arms outstretched
I am such a mess, I confess
Staring at the sky
Asking questions, why
Don't believe the lies
I see with open eyes
I see through the disguise
I'm not about to compromise
The answers are conversed
Don't ask me which is worse
True evil exists; you better be concerned
Before you have to face it
They will try and break you
Trick you into losing truth
Deeper within
There has to be conviction
You have to be you
With my arms outstretched
I am such a mess, I confess
Staring at the sky
Asking questions, why
Don't believe the lies
Never give up; never give in
It doesn't have to be their way
Don't fit in
Madness infiltrating the species
Increasing man's violent tendencies
Reaching and climbing
For something we can't see
What will become of remnants
Of all things that we hold so close and tight
Everything, watch it burn
They will try and break you
Trick you into losing truth
Deeper within
There has to be conviction
You have to be you
With my arms outstretched
I am such a mess, I confess
Staring at the sky
Asking questions, why
Don't believe the lies
They will soon just disappear
Then it will all seem too clear
They will then face all their fears
Cursing their wicked ways
