Father comes home from work
And he's scared to death
Mother cries for the kid, and the note she read
Father runs to the table, he said, "What's goin' on?"
Mother cries desperately, "Our little baby's gone"

Do you know where your children are?
Because it's now twelve o'clock
If they're somewhere out on the street
Just imagine how scared they are
Do you know where your children are?
Because it's now twelve o'clock
If they're somewhere out on the street
Just imagine how scared they are

She wrote that she is tired of stepdaddy using her
Sayin' that he'll buy her things, while sexually abusing her
Just think that she's all alone, somewhere out on the street
How will this girl survive?
She ain't got nothin' to eat

Do you know where your children are?
Because it's now twelve o'clock
If they're somewhere out on the street
Just imagine how scared they are
Do you know where your children are?
Because it's now twelve o'clock, yeah
If they're somewhere out on the street
Just imagine how scared they are, oh

Save me (From this living hell)
Save me ('Cause I, I wanna help)
Save me (I'm tired and I'm mad)
Save me ('Cause this, it ain't no joke)
Save me ('Cause I'm out for blood)
Save me ('Cause I don't wanna ignore)
Save me (It's time I replied)
Save me ('Cause I, I wanna defeat)
Save me

Hee, hee
Hoo, hoo

Now, she's on the move, she's off to Hollywood
She says she wanna be a star, she heard the money's good
She gets off from the train station, the man is waitin' there
"I'll show you where the money is, girl, just let down your hair"
He's taking her on the streets of Sunset Boulevard
She's selling her body hot, girl, that will take you far
The police come 'round the corner, somebody there, they told
He's arresting this little girl
Who's only twelve years old
