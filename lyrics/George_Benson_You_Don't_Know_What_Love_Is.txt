You don't know what love is
Until you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you had to lose
You don't know what love is
You don't know how lips hurt
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost
Until you've flipped you're heart and you have lost
You don't know what love is
Do you know how a lost hearts fears
The thought of reminiscing?
Or how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing
You don't know how hearts burn
For love that cannot live yet never dies
Until you've faced the dawn with sleepless еyes
You don't know what love is

Do you know how a lost hearts fеars
The thought of reminiscing?
Or how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing
You don't know how hearts burn
For love that cannot live yet never dies
Until you've faced the dawn with sleepless eyes
You don't know what love is
You don't know what love is
