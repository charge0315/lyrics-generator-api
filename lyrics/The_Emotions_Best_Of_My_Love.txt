Doesn't take much to make me happy
And make me smile with glee
Never, never will I feel discouraged
'Cause our love's no mystery

Demonstrating love and affection
That you give so openly, yeah
I like the way ya make me feel about ya baby
Want the whole wide world to see

Whoa-whoa, you got the best of my love
Whoa-whoa, you got the best of my love
Whoa-whoa, you got the best of my love
Whoa-whoa, you've got the best of my love

Goin' in and out of changes
The kind that come around each day
My life has a better meaning
Love has kissed me in a beautiful way

And oh, yeah, (my love, my love)
Oh, oh yeah, my love (my love, my love)

Oh, you got the best of my love
Whoa-whoa, (yes you do) you've got the best of my love (yes)
Whoa-whoa, you've got the best of my love
Whoa-whoa, you've got the best of my love

Demonstrating sweet love and affection
That you give so openly, yeah
The way I feel about ya baby can't explain it
Want the whole wide world to see

Ohhh, but in my heart
You're all I need
You for me (my love, my love) and me for you
Ohhh, yeah, it's growin' every day, (my love, my love)
