Please don't hurt me
I have told you
All my love is
All I've got
And tomorrow is the day
When I for your sake
I'm coming back
And you tell me
That I don't love you
I'm trying hard to make you jealous
Thinking maybe it will make you stay
It's so hard, love drives me crazy
It's so hard when you're away
And you tell me
That I don't love you
Because I love you
I will show you all the faces my love can have
So, please
Let me come to you and stay this time
And you tell me
That I don't love you
Oh you know that it's just not true
And you know...
