Mmm-mmm, mmm, hmm

Me and Mrs. Jones
We got a thing going on
We both know that it's wrong
But it's much too strong
To let it go now

We meet every day at the same café
Six-thirty and no one knows she'll be there
Holding hands, making all kinds of plans
While the jukebox plays our favorite songs

Me and Mrs., Mrs. Jones, Mrs. Jones, Mrs. Jones, hmm
We got a thing going on
We both know that it's wrong
But it's much too strong
To let it go now, mmm

We gotta be extra careful
That we don't build our hopes up too high
'Cause she's got her own obligations
And so, ohh, do I

Me and Mrs., Mrs. Jones, Mrs. Jones, Mrs. Jones, Mrs. Jones, mm-mmm

Well, it's time for us to be leaving
And it hurts so much, it hurts so much inside
And now she'll go her way, and I'll go mine
But tomorrow we'll meet
At the same place, the same time

Me and Mrs., Mrs., Mrs., Mrs. Jones
Same place We both know that it's wrong
Same time Every day at the same café
Same place We got a thing going on
We know it's wrong
Same time But it's much too strong
Same place Me and Mrs. Jones
