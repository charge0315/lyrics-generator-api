Looking at the clouds in the sky
Floating image in my mind
Land of beauty and land of peace
And now I wonder where this place is from
Evidence is everywhere
I'm gonna try, but now I'm scared
Strange beings all around
Come everyone to this place I've found

I'm feeling psyched to be walking
I wonder why
All my joys could be open
No more cries

My eyes are clear and now I'm cured
Don't you wanna be for sure?
I know my rights, I'm allowed to die
So I'd rather swap your different guise
It's in my head if you will find
Mother love from all mankind
Look above and then you shout
You run away to say your last goodbye

Feeling psyched to be walking
I wonder why
And my joys could be open
No more cries

I'm feeling psyched to be walking
Wonder why
All my joys could be open
No more cries
