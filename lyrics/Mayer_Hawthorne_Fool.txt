Said you won't be back
I didn't react, I was lazy
Thinkin' I was cool, drivin' 'round school
Tryin' to be a man, boy I was crazy

I hate to be alone, you're a part of me
How many years ago did you die for me?

I was a fool back in high school
I was a fool before I met you

Smoking after class
They don't need to ask if I was listening (Listen)
And there's hell to pay
When everybody's comin' late, yeah

I hate to be alone, you're a part of me
How many years ago did you die for me?

I was a fool back in high school
I was a fool before I met you

Do do do do
I keep on knocking at your door
Do do do do
I keep on coming back for more
Do do do do
I keep on knocking at your door
Do do do do
I keep on coming back

I was a fool back in high school (Can't believe the things I did before)
I was a fool before I met you (people knockin at the door)
I was a fool back in high school (I was such a fool)
I was a fool before I met you
I was a fool back in high school
