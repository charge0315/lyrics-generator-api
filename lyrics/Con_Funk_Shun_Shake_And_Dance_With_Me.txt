Hey, baby, why you goin' that way?
Oh, sugar, come on, go it my way
And I'm goin' to a place where funky people play
Oh, honey, we'll sure enough dance the night away

Girl, you got that sexy smile
You move, it's driving me wild
Girl, I kinda like your style
For you, I'd walk a country mile

Shake and dance with me (Ooh, baby)
Every night and day (Yeah)
Shake and dance with me
Where funky people play

Oh, sugar, you got honey drippin' off the walls
We might be trippin', skinny dippin', makin' love in the halls
Oh, honey, your mind'll never be the same
No, darlin', you don't have to be ashamed

Groovin' is the game we play
Girl, we'll dance the night away
Girl, we comin' day by day
You'll always hear the people say, say, say, say

Shake and dance with me (Ooh, ah, ooh, yeah, well)
Every night and day
Shake and dance with me
Where funky people play (Ah, play it again, Sam)

One more time

Shake and dance with me (Ooh, ah, ooh)
Every night and day (Yeah, well)
Shake and dance with me
Where funky people play

Shake and dance with me (Yeah, shake your body, well, well, well)
Every night and day (Go on, baby)
Shake and dance with me
Where funky people play
Shake and dance with me
Every night and day
