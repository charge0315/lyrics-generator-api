Picture me upon my knee
Just tea for two and two for tea
Just me for you
And you for me alone

Nobody near us
To see us or hear us
No friends or relations
On weekend vacations
We won't have it known, dear
That we own a telephone, dear

Day will break and I'll awake
And start to bake a sugar sugar cake
For you to take
For all the boys to see
We will raise a family
A girl for you, and a boy for me
Oh, can't you see
How happy we would be?
