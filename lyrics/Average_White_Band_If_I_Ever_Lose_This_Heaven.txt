If you're foolin', only foolin'
All I ask is "Why?"
And if you're playin', all I'm sayin' is
Feelings sure can lie
And if you're lyin', keep on lyin'
Don't tell the truth, don't you dare
You can't drop me, baby, you still got me
After takin' me way up there (Way up there, yeah)

Oh
If I ever lose this heaven
If I ever, ever lose this heaven
Oh, I'll never be the same (Not the same, no)
Oh
If I ever lose this heaven
If I ever, ever lose this heaven (Ooh)
Oh, I'll never be the same (Never be the same, yeah)

When you're kind, ooh, extra kind
Then suddenly, oh, baby, get cross
You're so moody, but you really get to me
And I can't turn you off, oh
You're fascinating, much more fascinating
Than the dark side of the moon
You're so exciting, hey babe, I'm rewriting
This book of love called "You" (Yes, it's you)

Oh
If I ever lose this heaven
If I ever, ever, ever lose this heaven, ooh
Oh, I'll never be the same (Never, never be the same, oh, oh)
Oh
If I ever lose this heaven
If I ever, ever lose this heaven, ooh
Oh, I'll never be the same (No)
Oh
If I ever lose this heaven
If I ever, ever lose this heaven (If I ever lose it, baby)
Oh, I'll never (Never, never, baby)
Never (No, I won't, no)
Never (Never)
Never (Be the same)
Oh (Oh)
If I ever lose this heaven (If I ever lose it)
If I ever, ever lose this heaven (Yeah, yeah)
Oh, I'll never be the same (Never be the same, oh)
Oh (Woo-hoo)
If I ever lose this heaven
If I ever, ever lose this heaven (Oh, oh)
Oh, I'll never be the same
