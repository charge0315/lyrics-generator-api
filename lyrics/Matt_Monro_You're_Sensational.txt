I've no proof when people say you're more or less aloof
But you're sensational
I don't care if you are called the fair miss Frigidaire
'Cause you're sensational
Making love is quite an art
What you require is the proper squire to fire your heart
And if you say that one fine day you'll let me to come to call
We'll have a ball coz you're sensational
Sensational that's all that's all that's all
And if you say that one fine day you'll let me come to call
We'll havе a ball coz you're sensational
Sensational that's all that's all that's all
