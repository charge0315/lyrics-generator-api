Watching the stars till they're gone
Like an actor all alone
Who never knew the story he was in
Who never knew the story ends
Like the sky reflecting my heart
All the colors become visible
When the morning begins
I'll read the last line

終わらない雨　抱きしめた　夜が朝を向かえる
心はまだ濡れたまま

In endless rain, I've been walking
Like a poet feeling pain
Trying to find the answers
Trying to hide the tears
But it was just a circle
That never ends
When the rain stops, I'll turn the page
The page of the first chapter

傷つくだけ　傷ついて　解ったはずの答えを
どうしてまだ　問いかけてる

Am I wrong to be hurt?
Am I wrong to feel pain?
Am I wrong to be in the rain?
Am I wrong to wish the night won't end?
Am I wrong to cry?
But I know it's not wrong to sing the last song
'Cause forever fades

気がつけば又　独り夜の空を見つめてる
少しづつ消えて行く　Our memories
傷つくだけ　傷ついて　解ったはずの答えを
どうしてまだ　問いかけてる

I see red
I see blue
But the silver lining gradually takes over
When the morning begins
I'll be in the next chapter

終わらない雨　抱きしめた　夜が朝を向かえる
心はまだ濡れたまま
傷つくだけ　傷ついて　解ったはずの答えを
どうしてまだ　問いかけてる
