[There is a more humanizing element at working music
And one of the manifestations of this
Is the return to the association of the individual
And his own feeling, his own emotion]
Welcome to the best years of your life
Welcome to the best years of your life
Welcome to the best years of your life
There is no release
In this faithful sky
All I wanna do is live then die
And if I am wandering
Through the loneliness inside
It's hard to even see the light
And in my dreams, your recurring lies
They tried to ruin all my eyes
And if we wanted to be inside
I dig a hole inside my mind
Welcome to the best years for your life
Welcome to the best years for your life
Welcome to the best years for your life
Welcome to the best years for your life
Welcome to the best years for your life
Welcome to the best years for your life
Welcome to the best years for your life
From there I would see all I wanted to see
Instead of all this misery
Surrounding me everywhere I'd be
Oh, the hatred coming home from sea
And if I wanted to be all I have to be
To be with you for you to be with me
And in a crazy
Hazy moment my mind
I thought that love in you I'd truly find
Welcome to the best years for your life
Welcome to the best years for your life
Welcome to the best years for your life
Welcome to the best years for your life
Welcome to the best years for your life
Welcome to the best years for your life
Welcome to the best years for your life
[There is a more humanizing element in working music
And one of the manifestations of this
Is the return to the association of the individual
And his own feeling, his own emotion]
