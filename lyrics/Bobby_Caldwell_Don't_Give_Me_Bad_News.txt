Hello, baby
It's been one of those days
And I've worked my heart out
For one more honest wage
I'm so weary
And it's taking its toll
So if you're gonna tell me
Something I don't wanna know

Hold on, baby
Don't think I should hear this yet
Can't it wait until tomorrow
Don't say something you might regret
Don't give me bad news
Not until I close my eyes
I don't wanna see you
See me so surprised

Little by little
It's gettin' me down
So if it's gonna be bad news
I don't wanna hang around

So hold on, baby
I don't think I should hear this yet
Can't it wait until tomorrow
Don't say something you might regret
Don't give me bad news

Someone tell me what a man has got to do
I don't think I ever ask that much of you
I don't want another confrontation
Either way I'm gonna lose
Don't give me bad news
Not until I loosen my tie
Not until I've had a chance to
Tell you not to say goodbye

So hold on, baby
I don't think I should hear this yet
Can't it wait until tomorrow
Don't say something you might regret
Don't give me bad news

Hello, baby
Come and take off your shoes
Tell me all your troubles
But don't give me bad news
Don't give me bad news
Don't give me bad news
