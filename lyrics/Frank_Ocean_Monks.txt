Mosh pits and bare chest
Stage divin' sky diver
Spray the crowd with cold water
Now it's mosh pits and wet tits
I think I need a cold shower
Cool waters
African girl speaks in English accent
Likes to fuck boys in bands
Likes to watch Westerns
And ride me without the hands
Show me her passport
She's on her own tour

But you're beautiful to me, ooh
Wave 'em high, girl, to the sky
But you're beautiful to me, oh (Woah)
We're in the clouds
Wave 'em high, girl, to the sky
But you're beautiful to me, oh (Woah)
Life in the clouds
Keep em high, y'all
Beautiful stars in the sky

Monks in the mosh pit
Stage divin' Dalai Lama
Feet covered in cut flowers
They mosh for enlightenment
Clean chakra, good karma
Oh, one with the water
Indian girl sleeps above the temple
Plannin' a runaway, young at heart
You found a boyfriend
And now you wanna get away, get away
Just a virgin lover on a getaway, get away
And at sunset, they're gonna try and get away, get away
Abhayamudra

I never ask for much
But please keep up, lover
We've got no choices left
The runnin's fast
Run, run, run, run
You're beautiful to me
Run, run, run, run, you'd better run
You mean so much to me
In my world, my world

We made it safely
Even with your father's army trailin' us
We escaped him
Even with his archers' bows at our backs
What a great escape (Oh, wow)
But there's a long way still, in fact (Ooh)
We're lost in a jungle, underneath these clouds
There's a monsoon that never ends
A coke-white tiger woke us from our slumber
To guide and protect us 'til the end

Woah, we're in the clouds
Wave 'em high now, to the sky
But you're beautiful to me, oh
Keep 'em high, y'all, show you right
But you're beautiful to me, oh
Right, beautiful
