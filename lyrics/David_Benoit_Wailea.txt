Was that your brother visiting?
It seemed a little late
Your eyes locked on him as he fought with the gate
Your car, it's dirty
You've let the garden grow
You've worn that dress two days in a row

If only you could see me
How I look at you
How I look at you

I saw you staying in last night
Dressed to the nines
Waiting for me
Your secret valentine
Never alone (never alone)
Never alone

If only you could see me
How I look at you
How I look at you

If only you could see me
How I look at you {never alone}
At least you'd know you're nеver alone (nevеr alone)
If only you could see me
How I look at you {never alone}
At least you'd know you're never alone (never alone)
If only you could see me
How I look at you {never alone}
At least you'd know you're never alone (never alone)
If only you could see me
How I look at you {never alone}
At least you'd know you're never alone (never alone)
