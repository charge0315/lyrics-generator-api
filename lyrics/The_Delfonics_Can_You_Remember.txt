Can you remember when we were children?
(Children)
We were always together and we were best friends
But now that you are grown, girl, you left me all alone
You know I'll never find no one to call my own
And girl, I love you, I love you
Baby, let me love you
(I love you)
I sure would like for you to remember if you can
(Try to remember)
The time we had and the times we spent just a-playin' in the sand
Ooh
Can you remember when we were children?
(Children)
We were always together and our love had no pain
When sunny skies were blue, girl, you know that I love you
And I'll always promise you that this is what I'll do
And girl, I love you, I love you
Baby, let me love you
(I love you)
I sure would like for you to remember if you can the fun we had
And the times we spent just a-playin' in the sand
Ooh, I sure would like for you to remember if you can
The fun we had
