I got a hand but my hand has changed it's mind
I got a hand but my hand has changed it's mind
It wiz not drunk
It wiz not sick
Jes dissatisfied
I got a mind to fold the hand I'm holding tonight
I got a mind to fold the hand I'm holding tonight
I wuz not nuts
Wuz not high
Jes Dissatisfied
Dissatisfaction
Caused this reaction, this old hand
Changed it's mind, still dissatisfied
Not a helpin' hand
Coz my mind underhanded me
Keep it dissatisfied with your back hand signs
Got a hand but my hand dun changed it's mind
