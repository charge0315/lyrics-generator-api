Three came in the clothes that I'm in
And through the phone on my wall
They were strangers
They drive in the car that I'm in
And you never see their face at all
They were strangers
They drive in the car that I'm in
And you never see their face at all
They know my fears and cry my tears
Through a face without an eye at all
They came in the phone that I'm in
And through the face on my wall
Know my tears and cry my fears
Through an eye without a face at all
They came in the phone that I'm in
And through the face on my wall
Know my tears and cry my fears
Through an eye without a face at all
