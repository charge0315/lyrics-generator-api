Fun is in, it's no sin, it's that time again
To shed your load, hit the road on the run again
Summer skies in our eyes and a warmer sun
It's one for all, all for one, all for all out fun

Gotta go to it
(Yeah)
Gonna go through it
(Yeah)
Gotta get with it

Looking good down the hood of a funky ride
On the way to the tide just to tan your hide (On the way)
In the shade, lemonade, in the sun, ocean spray (In the shade)
To get your face in the race or lay back's no disgrace (Ocean spray)

Gotta go to it
(Yeah)
Gonna go through it
(Yeah)
Gotta get with it

It's OK to get out there and have some fun (It's OK)
By yourself maybe or else with a special one (By yourself)
Good or bad, glad or sad, it's all going to pass (Good or bad)
So it's OK, let's all play and enjoy it while it lasts (It's OK)

Gotta go to it
(Yeah)
Gonna go through it
