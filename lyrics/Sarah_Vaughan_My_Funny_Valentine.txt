My funny valentine
Sweet comic valentine
You make me smile with my heart
Your looks are laughable, un-photographable
Yet, you're my favourite work of art
Is your figure less than greek?
Is your mouth a little weak?
When you open it to speak, are you smart?
But, don't change a hair for me
Not if you care for me
Stay little valentine, stay!
Each day is valentine, my valentine
Each day is valentine's day
