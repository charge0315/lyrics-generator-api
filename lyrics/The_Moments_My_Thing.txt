I don't want nobody () in the world
Messin' around with my thing
A sweet, tender, lovin', groovy thing
(No he don't want nobody in the world
Messin' around with his thing)
Hands off, you hear me?
Leave my thing alone

I told you guys
She's my special prize
When I turn my back
You want to try her out for size

But I don't want nobody () in the world
Messin' around with my thing
A sweet, tender, lovin', groovy thing
(No, he don't want nobody in the world
Messin' around with his thing)
Hands off, you hear me?
Leave my thing alone

Into each life, some rain must fall
If I catch you messin' with mine
You won't have no life at all

'Cause you won't want nobody () in the world
Messin' around with your thing (Your thing, your thing)
You groovy, groove thing
And likewisе, I don't want nobody in the world
Messin' around with my thing (My thing, my thing)
Leavе my thing alone

I don't want nobody () in the world
Messin' around with my thing
A sweet, tender, lovin', groovy thing
