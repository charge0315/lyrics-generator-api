Come
Lie down beneath my shadow
Lie down beneath my shadow with great delight
And you feel will be sweet to me
Come
My left hand under your head
While my right embraces time
Therein, my virgin, love's wine

Pheromone make a nigga go crazy
Fuckin' around make a nigga wanna die

L is for lust
O is for obsession
V is for the vast way you envelop my soul
This is crazy, this is crazy
I could die from the pheromone

I can see the castle, I can see the throne
I can see the beloved and she's not alone
But it's cool like that
'Cause I'll be digging her just the same
I can see the curtain wrestled from the wall
I can see her hands tied, I can see it all
He pulls a gat
This is how they play the game
And I'm around the back
'Cause curiosity, it knows no shame

Pheromone, rush over me like an ocean
Pheromone, controlling my every motion
Pheromone, I'm helpless as a pet
Pheromone, when your body's wet

I can feel the tension through the crack in the door
He begs for love while she's disgusted more
And I'm on fire, 'cause I never seen her nude before
I wanna save her (save her)
I want for watch (watch)
All my vital signs go up a couple of notches
When he unties her and she runs to the open door
He trips and grinds her (grinds her)
Right there all on the floor (on the floor)
She's so close I can touch her (touch her)

Pheromone, rush over me like an ocean
Pheromone, controlling my every motion
Pheromone, I'm helpless as a pet
Pheromone, when your body's wet

Her eyes are closed but there's no penetration
He just makes her point the pistol to his nose
While he masturbates and now I see a tear
Heading down towards her smile
What happens next, it all depends upon your style

Oh, this is crazy baby

Pheromone, rush over me like an ocean
Pheromone, controlling my every motion
Pheromone, I'm helpless as a pet
Pheromone, when your body's wet
Pheromone, rush over me like an ocean
Pheromone, controlling my every motion
Pheromone, I'm helpless as a pet
Pheromone, when your body's wet
