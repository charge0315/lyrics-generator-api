That's the joint
That's the joint
That's the joint
That's the joint
That's the joint
That's the joint
That's the joint
That's the jam
Play it again

I like the way the rhythm makes me jump and move
It gots a feelin' that makes me wanna do my do
Got me feelin' joy, turn my grey sky blue
And when you hear a cut, baby doll, I know you
Feel it, huh? Get up on the floor, start movin' some
Body parts that got brothers actin’ dumb
And they be actin’ dumb, dumb
And they be actin' dumb from the cut that's playin'
People break they neck from this demonstration
We about mass appeal, no segregation
Got Black to Asian, and Caucasian

That's the joint
That's the joint
That's the jam
Play it again
That's the joint
That's the joint
That's the jam
Play it again

Let your body collide to the rhythm provided
By the mind state affairs, classified to make y'all
Heat up and flare, I swear
I serenade the soul and, so beware
And what's happenin' here, seek one to help you
Feelin’ a piece of mind, let your spine unwind
Maybe in time we can stop this crime
But until then, yo, I'ma rock a rhyme sayin'

That's the joint
That's the joint
That's the jam
Play it again
That's the joint
That's the joint
That's the jam
Play it again
That's the joint
That's the joint
That's the joint
That's the joint
That's the joint
That's the joint
That's the joint
That's the joint

Got some streets appeal with the junk that’s real
I don't need no steel to make my point
Get down and dirty ‘cause that's my joint
Ha! Ha! Ha! That's my joint
Ha! Ha! Ha! That's my joint
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha, that's my joint
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha, that's my joint
We preferably make our point
Through a nation we build off the musical field
Or a visual thrill, we do what we feel
Any time or place, on stage, in your face
Orbiting in Earth, and outer space

We rock that urm, we flip that um
Some East coast, West coast, cosmic um
Some Northbound um, some, some Southbound um
Some overseas London out of town um
Rockin' the joint, rockin' the jams

Turn that shit up, play it again
'Cause that's the joint, that's the jam
Turn that shit

That's the joint
That's the joint
That's the jam
Play it again
That's the joint
That's the joint
That's the jam
Play it again
That's the joint
