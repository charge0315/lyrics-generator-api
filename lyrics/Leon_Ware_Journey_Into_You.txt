It's a journey, into you
It's a journey
Let me look at you
From your head down to your toes
I'll try to memorize, every curve and a every line
In my journey into you
Won't seem to take so long
Let your love show, at the road to your heart
Feeling far, when we're in each other's arms
Woo, baby
I've been waiting so long to love you
Ooh sugar
Can't you show me
Show me the way to love you
Ooh, you shock me lady
Take me by the hand
Guide me deep inside your heart
Let love's feelings flow
Like honey, trickling from the comb
In my journey into you
Won't seem to take so long
Let love flow
To my heart
Till we're in each other's arms
Ooh baby
I've been waiting, so long to love you
Come and show me the way to love you
Ooh
In my journey, into you
Won't seem to take so long
Let love flow to your heart
Till we're in each other's arms
In my journey into you
Won't seem to take so long
Let love flow to your heart
Ooh, till in each other's arms
Ooh, baby
We're in each other's arms
In my journey into you
Won't seem to take so long
Let love flow to your heart
Till we're in each other's arms
It's a journey
Into you
It's a journey, it's a journey
Into you
Journey
Journey
(It's a journey)
Journey
Oh, journey
(It's a journey)
Journey
(Into you)
Journey...
