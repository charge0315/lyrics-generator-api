Butterfly
Came into our room one summer night
Lit the gloom
And our hearts took flight
You and I and our butterfly
Two wings
Such pretty things. I still recall
I close my eyes
To a waterfall
Why, oh, why, baby butterfly?
One day
We’ll follow you into the garden
We’ll lay down flowers in the rain
Where life would never be the same
That day
You flew away and left us changed
Who could have known
You’d need more
Than life could give?
One day
We’ll follow you into the garden
We’ll lay our flowers in the rain
Where life would never be the same
And someday
We’ll know where life goes into colour
And everyone we’ve loved before
Will take us through
Butterfly
Came into our room one summer night
Lit the gloom
And our hearts took flight
You and I and our butterfly
