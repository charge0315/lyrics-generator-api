Hearts are like flowers
To be broken
When you spaced them on the floor
It always stinged
And you said you'd always
Be a friend to be
But you do things in your life
That will change someone
More that you'll ever changed youself
And it will never be the same
No it will never be the same
No it will never be the same
Loving you
Heart are like lovers in the spring
Everyday has something new to bring
But now my heart is like your tears on a string
Cause you do things in your life
That will change someone
More than you'll ever change yourself
And it will never be the same
No it will never be the same
No it will never be the same
Loving you
No it will never be the same
No it will never be the same
No it will never be the same
No it will never be the same
It will never be the same
It will never be the same
Never be the same
Be the same
Never be the same
Never be the same
Never be the same
Never be the same
Be the same
Oh la la la oh la la la
Oh la la la oh la la la
