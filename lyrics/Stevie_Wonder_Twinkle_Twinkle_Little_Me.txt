Twinkle twinkle
Little me
I have a lovely light
I'm the star
Upon your tree
That makes your Christmas bright
Twinkle twinkle little me
I left the milky way
Just so I could come and be with you on Christmas day

Angels brought me where you are
And heaven gave me light
I'm that friendly little star
You wish upon each night

Twinkle twinkle little me
I have a present too
If you give unselfishly
And make a wish come true
I'll always shine for you

Hi kids!
Look out your window
You see that little star way up there?
The one that's all alone
Well that's me
That's right
And this Christmas, I'm coming all the way down
To where you are
Just to light up your Christmas tree
And I hope
To light up your hearts

Well, twinkle twinkle little me
I have a present too
If you give unselfishly
And make a wish come true

I'll always shine for you
