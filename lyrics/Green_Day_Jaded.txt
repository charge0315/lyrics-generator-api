Somebody keep my balance, I think I'm fallin' off
Into a state of regression
The expiration date rapidly coming up
It's leavin' me behind to rank

Always move forward
Goin' straight will get you nowhere
There is no progress, evolution killed it all
I found my place in nowhere

I'm taking one step sideways, leadin' with my crutch
Got a fucked up equilibrium
Count down from nine to five, hooray, we're gonna die
Blessed into our distinction

Always move forward
Goin' straight will get you nowhere
There is no progress, evolution killed it all
I found my place in nowhere

Always move forward
Goin' straight will get you nowhere
There is no progress, evolution killed it all
I found my place in nowhere
In nowhere, in nowhere
