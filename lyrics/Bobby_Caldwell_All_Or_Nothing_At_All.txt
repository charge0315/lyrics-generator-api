Every day we go through
I do something that'll please you baby
And I know
Having you around
Keeps me grounded
If I get jealous
If I act like a fool
It's an over reaction to loving you

I want it all or nothing at all
That's what I need from you
And baby it's true
I'll be there whenever you call
But I need all or nothing at all

Other men try for you
They won't give you what I do now baby
I won't share
Want you to myself
And I'll keep trying
Gonna make my lovin'
The best it can be
'Cause I need your devotion desperately

Want it all or nothing at all
That's what I need from you
And baby it's true
I'll be there whenever you call
But I need all or nothing at all

Just tell me now there's no other man
'Cause I don't want my heart broken up again
And when you say that you'll never let go
Only then will I know

All or nothing at all
That's what I need from you
And baby it's true
I'll be there whenever you call
But I need all or nothing at all
