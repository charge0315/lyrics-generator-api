I'm just homeless
Homeless
I'm just homeless
Homeless
Ooh lord
Just a year ago
I was in the go
(?)
And walking on air
Never thought as far
I just hit a bar
Saw the signs of grief
And still would not care
(?)
These words they repeat
(?)
Look out for the need
Of these
I was someone more
Cause I was no one poor
To find that I too was down on my knees
I'm just homeless
Homeless
I'm just homeless
Homeless
And people wonder why
Homeless
Homeless
Ooh lord
I'm just homeless
Homeless
Don't you cry for me
Just out here I see
Babies and families
Don't have a dad
(?)
Crack (?)
Politicians see but won't take the time
Homeless
Homeless
Ooh yeah
Homeless
Homeless
See me walking by
Homeless
Homeless
Homeless
Homeless
Homeless
Homeless
Homeless
Homeless
I'm just homeless
Homeless
I'm just homeless
Homeless
(?) and fat tables
Leaving biscuits and gravy (?)
Men and ladies
In their Mercedes
Passing by me
But no time for the poor
Without some money
Sure 'nuff the money talk
Just try to buy with your pocket unfilled
(No bills)
Become invisible
And indefensible
(?)
Just don't bring a meal
I'm just homeless
Homeless
Homeless
Homeless
See me walking by
People wonderin' why
Tears flow down my eyes
Take it to the street
I feel so incomplete
Worry worry me
Politicians see
Trying to keep my pride
Don't want to die inside
