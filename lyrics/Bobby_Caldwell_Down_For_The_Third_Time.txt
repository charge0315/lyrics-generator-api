Left your mark
In a distant past
But somehow it's all gone now
Good things can never last
You are down for the third time
And you spent your change
Memories of your prime
Make life seem so strange

Through your life
You've been well-to-do
Times have changed
And rearranged
Now no one remembers you
You are down for the third time
And you spent your change
Daddy won't mind
When you rearrange your life
