Let the junkie bust the pusher
Let the junkie bust the pusher

Get high, slidin' by
(Could this be)
Floatin' with ease, like he please
So nimble and on his knees

Let the junkie bust the pusher
Let the junkie bust the pusher

Society makes it,  break it
It's much too much, now I can't take it
It's disgrace to lose your place
The man is high, what a waste

Let the junkie bust the pusher
Let the junkie bust the pusher

Walk in the street, often eat
Duckin' quick to get a fix
With the world coming to
 look like you

(In that stash, in the stash
It's in the stash, in the stash
In the , it's in the bag
Do the stash,  in the bag)

 is wrong to turn him in
Start his life over again
Get it high, lost in the game
Full of misery, full of pain

Let the junkie bust the pusher
Let the junkie bust the pusher
Let the junkie bust the pusher
Let the junkie bust the pusher

(In that stash, in the stash
It's in the stash, in the stash
In the , it's in the bag
Do the stash,  in the bag)
(In that stash, in the stash
It's in the stash, in the stash
In the , it's in the bag
Do the stash,  in the bag)
