Like a long, lonely stream
I keep runnin' towards a dream
Movin' on (Movin' on), movin' on (Movin' on)
Like a branch on a tree
I keep reachin' to be free
Movin' on (Movin' on), movin' on (Movin' on)

'Cause there's a place in the sun
Where there's hope for everyone
Where my poor, restless heart's gotta run
There's a place in the sun
And before my life is done
Got to find me a place in the sun

Like an old, dusty road
I get weary from the load
Movin' on (Movin' on), movin' on (Movin' on)
Like this tired, troubled earth
I've been rollin' since my birth
Movin' on (Movin' on), movin' on (Movin' on)

'Cause there's a place in the sun
Where there's hope for everyone
Where my poor, restless heart's gotta run
I know there's a place in the sun
And before my life is done
Got to find me a place in the sun

You know, when times are bad
And you're feeling sad (I will find me a place in the sun)
I want you to always remember—

Yes, there's a place in the sun (Place in the sun, place in the sun)
Where there's hope for everyone (Hope for everyone, hope for everyone)
Where my poor, restless heart's gotta run (Poor, restless heart, poor, restless heart, run)
I know there's a place in the sun (Place in the sun, place in the sun)
And before
