Yes this is the year
To make your decision
(We've gotta get it together)
Yes this is the year
To open up your mind

If you've been holding back
(yeah)
Kind of slack
Now's the time to get the things you need
There ain't no reason why you should be shy
People have died to set you free

Oh we need everyone to succeed
Everybody to succeed
(Need everybody)
We're just like soldiers in an army
Come on and join us please
Come on, come on and join us please

Yes this is the year
(come on)
To make your decision
(We gotta get it together)
Yes this is the year
(come on)
To open up your mind

If you're strung out on a Jones, yeah
You better make sure
That you leave the bad stuff alone
Whatever you wanna do
Think it over good
'cause the choice is up to you

Oh we need everyone to succeed
Everybody to succeed
(We need everybody)
We're just like soldiers in an army
Come on and join us please
Come on, come on and join us please

Yes this is the year
(come on)
To make your decision
(We gotta get it together)
Yes this is the year
(come on)
To open up your mind
