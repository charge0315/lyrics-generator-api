And now she's stinging in the rain
Cause she's got so much to give
And I still don't know her name
But I really wish I did
There's a magic in her moves
And I bet you never knew
Come on, stand here for a while
She'll be standing into you
I love it when you get on down and work me babe
On your knees, once again
She's a fast persuader, outer space
Escalated to elation any place
Girl's got crazy rhythm
She's coming from a stranger place
All wrapped up in music
With a star gaze on her face
She got it
Straight ahead, you and me, something I can't hold forever
Love it when she's tearing up the brakes
She's a dream, fantasy, I don't need too much persuading
Give her all the heart she wants to take
Now and then I wonder why cupid shot me with his arrow
See my wings are melting near the sun
Got my head in a spin, there's no job that she's begun to
Get on down and work me, babe
On your knees, once again
She's a fast persuader, outer space
Escalated to elation any place
Girl's got crazy rhythm
She's coming from a stranger place
All wrapped up in music
With a star gaze on her face
She got it
I love it when you get on down, work me, babe
On your knees, once again
She's a fast persuader, yeah, outer space
Escalated to elation any place
Girl's got crazy rhythm
She's coming from a stranger place
All wrapped up in music
With a star gaze on her face
You know she's got it
Come on down, come on, work me, baby
And she never ever gonna let it go
Come on down, come on work me, baby
She got it, she got it
Come on down, come on work me, baby
You got me wrapped up in your music
Come on down, come on work me, baby
Yeah, I'm traveling at the speed of light tonight, baby
Yeah, I'm traveling at the speed of sound
And now, yeah, I'm traveling at the speed of light tonight, baby
Yeah, I'm traveling at the speed of sound
And now
