You're so right for me
I’m so right for you
But I know that you don't think it's right
To love the way we do
But both of us hurt someone else
Every time we touch
But we’ve gone too far too fast
And now it's time to think of us
A love so right just can't be wrong
And when it feels so strong
We know that we should be together
The time for us is here and now
The night will show us how
To let this moment last forever
In some other time
Or in some other place
Who knows, I might have passed you by
As just another face
But something deep inside of me moved
And all at once I knew
That life is more than just
A string of days for getting through
A love so right just can't be wrong
And when it feels this strong
We know that we should be together
The time for us is here and now
The night will show us how
To let this moment last forever
Tonight we're not gonna fight this feelin'
God only knows how hard we try
So tomorrow I'll wake and watch you sleepin'
And the moment you rise
The love in your eyes will tell me
A love so right just can’t be wrong
And when it feels this strong
We know that we should be together
The time for us is here and now
The night will show us how
To let this moment like forever
A love so right just can’t be wrong
And when it feels this strong
We know that we should be together
The time for us is here and now
The night will show us how
To let this moment like forever...
