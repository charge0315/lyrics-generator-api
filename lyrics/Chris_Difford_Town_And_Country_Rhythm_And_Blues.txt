I like the city, I like the sound
There's all that music
That's pumping around
I like the heat, pacing the street
From Clapham Junction
To Camden Town
It's town and country
It's rhythm and blues
It's big tall building
It's perfect views
I love my life
Well it's alright
When I'm not here
I'm not all there
I like the fields, I like the hills
There's all that fresh air
Around the wheels
I like the clam, the hops on the farm
The color of the landscape
The pitch of the barn
Town and country rhythm and blues
Always makes me think of you
Heading out in my walking shoes
Town and country rhythm and blues
Well I ride my bike, I drive my car
The sun is burning but I won't go far
Without that speed, that's all I need
To get where I''m going
From where I've been
