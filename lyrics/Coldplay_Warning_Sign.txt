A warning sign
I missed the good part, then I realised
I started lookin' and the bubble burst
I started lookin' for excuses

Come on in
I've gotta tell you what a state I'm in
I've gotta tell you in my loudest tones
That I started lookin' for a warning sign

When the truth is
I miss you
Yeah, the truth is
That I miss you so

A warning sign
You came back to haunt me and I realised
That you were an island and I passed you by
When you were an island to discover

Come on in
I've gotta tell you what a state I'm in
I've gotta tell you in my loudest tones
That I started lookin' for a warning sign

When the truth is
I miss you
Yeah, the truth is
That I miss you so

And I'm tired
I should not have let you go

(No)
So I crawl back into your open arms
Yes, I crawl back into your open arms
And I crawl back into your open arms
Yes, I crawl back into your open arms
