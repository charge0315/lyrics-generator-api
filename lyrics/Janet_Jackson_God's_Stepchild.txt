Got a story for you
'Bout a little friend
Never felt good enough
Had a heart to mend
Never felt pretty
Learned to just pretend
Wished someone had listened
For her silent cries of pain

Maybe I'm the lucky one
Maybe the forgotten one
Maybe, but I know
I'm not God's stepchild

Didn't want to burden
Mother had enough distress
So often I'd talk to you
Through my four-legged friends
Always there to listen
Though I felt so all alone
And in my times of trouble
I know you saw my smiles of pain

Maybe I'm the lucky one
Maybe the forgotten one
Maybe, but I know
I'm not God's stepchild

Now that I'm much older
I've gone through so much pain
I learned that I should love me
No more feeling ashamed
I've seen the great illusions
I've sought the rough terrain
I'm walking my own journey
And my love for you remains

Maybe I'm the lucky one
Maybe the forgotten one
Maybe, but I know
I'm not God's stepchild
Maybe I'm the lucky one
Maybe the forgotten one
Maybe, but I know
I'm not God's stepchild

I know I'm the lucky one
I know I'm a special one
I know that God does
Not have a stepchild
