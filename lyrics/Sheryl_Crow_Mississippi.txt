Every step of the way, we walk the line
Your days are numbered, so are mine
Time is pilin' up, we struggle and we scrape
All boxed in, nowhere to escape

The city's just a jungle, more games to play
I'm trapped in the heart of it, tryin' to get away
I was raised in the country,  een workin' in the town
I been in trouble since I set my suitcase down

I ain't got nothing for you, I had nothing before
Don't even have anything for myself anymore
Sky's full of fire and the rain is pourin' down
There's nothin' you can sell me, so I'll see you around

All my powers of expression
And thoughts so sublime
Could never do you justice
Reason or rhyme

Well, there's only one thing that I did wrong
I stayed in Mississippi a day too long

The devil's in the alley, the mule kickin' in the stall
Say anything you wanna, I've heard it all
I was thinkin' about the things that she said
I was dreamin' I was sleepin' in your bed

Walkin' through the leaves, fallin' from the trees
Feel like a stranger nobody sees
So many things we never will undo
I know you're sorry, well, I'm sorry too

Some people will offer you their hand and some won't
Last night I knew you, tonight, I don't
I need somethin' strong to distract my mind
I'm gonna look at you 'til my eyes go blind

Well, I got here, followin' the southern star
I crossed that river just to be where you are

There's only one thing that I did wrong
I stayed in Mississippi a day too long

Well, my ship's been split to splinters
It's sinkin' fast
I'm drownin' in the poison
Got no future, got no past
But my heart is not weary, it's light and it's free
I've got nothin' but affection for those who've sailed with me

Everybody's movin' if they ain't already there
Everybody's gotta move somewhere
Well, stick with me, baby, anyhow
Things should start to get interesting right about now

Well, my clothes are wet, they're tight on my skin
Not as tight as the corner that I painted myself in
I know that fortune is waiting to be kind
So give me your hand and say you'll be mine

The emptiness is endless, cold as clay
You can always come back
But you can't come back all the way

Well, there's only one thing that I did wrong
I stayed in Mississippi a day too long
Yeah, the only one thing that I did wrong
I stayed in Mississippi a day too long
The only one thing that I did wrong
I stayed in Mississippi a day too long (Woo)
