Lookin' at me, now who do you see
Somebody with sparkling eyes
Not so long ago my tears would flow
You gave me a lovely surprise

I was tired of being alone
You lifted me my love
So glad I got 'cha
I was tired of being alone
You lifted me my love
I'm mad about 'cha

Lookin' at you I see how I knew
Somebody had something to say
Turned me around, and your sweet sound
Will keep me smilin' for days

I was tired of being alone
You lifted me my love
So glad I got 'cha
I was tired of being alone
You lifted me my love
I'm mad about 'cha

Once I sang a song of pain
'Bout the clouds and the pourin' rain
Now I sing a song of love
'Bout the happiness you bring

Glad I got 'cha
So glad I got 'cha
You lifted me up and I'm mad about 'cha
I got 'cha my love
I got 'cha my love
Glad I got 'cha
So glad I got 'cha
You lifted me up and I'm mad about 'cha
I got 'cha my love
I got 'cha my love

I was tired of being alone
You lifted me my love
So glad I got 'cha
I was tired of being alone
You lifted me my love
I'm mad about 'cha
