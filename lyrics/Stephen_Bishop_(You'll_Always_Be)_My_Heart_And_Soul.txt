The years they come and go
And change will come I know
You won't be there, my heart and soul
With every time and place
But time cannot erase
The smile that lines your face
As you gaze in mine, you will always shine
And you would always be
An angel making sure I care
The memory, that's always there
Your dreams won't die, they live inside of me
You know you'll always be
My heart and soul
The years roll on and on
I looked and you were gone
I miss you so, my heart and soul
The years can make you wise
Now I finally realize
That if I just close my eyes
I can see you there, and the love we share
And you will always be
A dream so real, that cannot die
A trusting faith that lets me fly
A love so strong that just belong to me
You know you'll always be
My heart and soul
Oh, an angel making sure I care
The memory that's always there
You'll always be my heart and soul
