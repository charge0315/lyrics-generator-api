Destiny
Destiny, protect me from the world
Destiny
Hold my hand, protect me from the world

Here we are
With our running and confusion
And I don't see no confusion anywhere

And if the world does turn
And if London burns
I'll be standing on the beach with my guitar
I wanna be in a band when I get to heaven
Anyone can play guitar
And they won't be a nothing anymore

Grow my hair
Grow my hair, I am Jim Morrison
Grow my hair
I wanna be, wanna be, wanna be Jim Morrison

Here we are
With our running and confusion
And I don't see no confusion anywhere

And if the world does turn
And if London burns
I'll be standing on the beach with my guitar
I wanna be in a band when I get to heaven
Anyone can play guitar
And they won't be a nothing anymore
