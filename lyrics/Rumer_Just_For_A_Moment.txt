I've been up drinking
Biding my time
I've loaded and wasted, all my desires
I've been using myself
Like only I can
But I understand
That you understand
'Cause just for a moment
I found my peace
Just for a moment
I came across me
Everything is on
There's nothing I'm missing
Just for a moment
I found my way
I've been up drinking
Biding my time
I've loaded and wasted, all my desires
I've been using myself
Like only I can
But I understand
That you understand
'Cause just for a moment
I found my peace
Just for a moment
I came across me
Everything is on
There's nothing I'm missing
Just for a moment
I was complete
Just for a moment I was complete
