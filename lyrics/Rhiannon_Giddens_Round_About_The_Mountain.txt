Round about the mountain, round about the mountain
My Lord's a-rulin' and she'll rise in His arms
Round about the mountain, round about the mountain
My Lord's a-rulin' and she'll rise in His arms

The Lord loves a sinner, the Lord loves a sinner man
The Lord loves a sinner and she'll rise in his arms

When I was a sinner, a-seekin' just like you
I went down in the valley and I prayed till I come through
You hypocrite, you concubine, your place amongst the swine
You go to God with your lips and tongues, but you leave your heart behind

The Lord loves a sinner, the Lord loves a sinner man
The Lord loves a sinner and she'll rise in his arms

Goin' round the mountain, there I'll take my stand
I heard the voice of Jesus, thank God he's in this land

The Lord loves a sinner, the Lord loves a sinner man
The Lord loves a sinner and she'll rise
