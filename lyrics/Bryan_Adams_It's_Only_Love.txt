When the feeling has ended
There ain't no use pretending
Don't you worry, it's only love
When your world has been shattered
Ain't nothing else matters
It ain't over, it's only love
And that's all, yeah

When your heart has been broken
Hard words have been spoken
It ain't easy, but it's only love
And if your life ain't worth living
And you're ready to give in
Just remember that it's only love, oh

You can live without the aggravation
You gotta wanna win, you gotta wanna win
You keep looking back in desperation
Over and over and over again

Yeah, yeah, it's only love, baby
Oh, yeah, hey, hey
Ooh, baby, baby, it's only love, love, love
Love, love, love
When your world has been shattered
Ain't nothing else matters
It ain't over, it's only love
If your life ain't worth living
And you're ready to give in
Just remember that it's only love, yeah
That's all
Yeah, it ain't easy, baby, it's only love
And that's all
