If the groove fits your desire
Then let it take you a little bit higher
I see we've finally found the groove
The kind of groove that's gonna make you move
And if you're feelin' what I feel
I'll bet you know that the groove is real
Hold on, don't let go
Hold on, take it slow
And if the groove fits your desire
Let it take you a little bit higher
Hold on,hold on,hold on,hey
Everybody's groovin' to the funky beat
It's the kind of beat
That makes you wanna tap your feet
And you can do it without really tryin'
This funky groove is so electrifyin'
Hold on, don't let go
Hold on, take it slow
And if the groove fits your desire
Let it take you a little bit higher
Hold on,hold on,hold on,hey
I see we've finally found the groove
The kinda groove that's gonna make you move
And if you're feelin' what I feel
Then you know that the groove is real
Hold on,hold on,hold on,hold on
Comon on,fellows
Hold on,hold that groove
Hold on,hold that groove
Hold on,hold that groove
Hold on,hold that groove
Hold on,hold that groove
Hold on,hold that groove
Hold on,hold that groove
Hold on,hold that groove
