I can see your face every time
Anywhere, any place in my mind
If my guard is ever low (Ever low)
There's a place that I can go

Elixer (Elixer)
Elixer (Elixer)
Elixer (Elixer)

You can fight in vain (Fight in vain)
I'm gonna have my way
All night and all day
Seven tears fall like rain in between the joy and pain (Fall like rain)
Oowie, baby

Elixer (Elixer)
Elixer (Elixer)
Elixer
Elixer
Elixer
Elixer (Yes it does)

Hand in hand woman and man
Through the tallest doors, up the stairs (Up the stairs)
Two animals spawning in a river
They go there (They go there), oowie, baby

Oh elixer, up and down
Elixer, 'round and 'round
Elixer (Don't stop, baby)
Oh, oh, oh
Elixer
Elixer
Elixer

Write this down:
With his pen
Amid the sound
Ink and tongue
Of machinations
Is this real or all in fun?
City noise
He writes it there
Oh yes, he writes it
Writes it there
Elixier
Naked girl
A single word
Naked boy
That she heard
They lay exposed
Exposed
Can you hear it?
Oh yes, she heard it
Can you hear it?
Fully clothed, fully clothed

Oh elixir (It's early in the day for their relationship)
Elixir (In the truth he hardly knows her except for her lips)
Elixir (She moans, sighs, and groans)
Oh elixir
Ooh, baby, ooh
Elixir (Do it, baby)
Elixir
Almost there, baby
Yeah
