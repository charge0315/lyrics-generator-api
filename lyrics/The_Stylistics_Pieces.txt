Foolish pride can reap destruction
A feeling lost through the mind
I let my pride stand in between us
Never knowing that I
Had build wall protecting a need inside me
I was a fool thinking only of me
Not seeing nothing more than
My precious pride and ego
Now all that's left for me

Pieces of a photograph
I tore in half
Pieces of love
Pieces of the past

Time is made with face a shadow
And like a thief in the night
It comes to call slowly creeping
It disappears in the light
But I won't ever break that the chain around me
I'll find away to shine off the things that bind me
Memories still spinning their webs upon me
But now I'm left alone

Pieces of a photograph
I tore in half
Pieces of love
Pieces of the past

 X4
Pieces of a photograph
I tore in half
Pieces of love
Pieces of the past
