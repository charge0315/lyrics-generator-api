Well first you gotta wanna get off bad enough to wanna get on him in the first place
And you better trust in your lady luck
Pray to God that she don't give up on you right now
Live fast die young bull rider
One hand hold is all you got it's you and the bull against the clock and a cross crowd
And once upon a spinnin' ton nothin' else you've ever done can pull this way
You're just outside the buckin' shoot
Lose a spur you lose your seat and you lose yourself
By now he's buckin' mean and dirty
Slingin' mud and cowboy boots and kickin' clowns
No fools no fun bull rider
You gotta feel the way he's movin' you gotta watch his head
And brace yourself for anything that a friend of you might dead
You know the art of hangin' loose hangin' just as tight
Well there's something like a hurricane who's dancin' with the kite
Live fast die young bull rider
Well the rodeo is more than rough
It's a fact of life it's tough to cut his fever ass
It's drinkin' beer and pullin' trailers
Tighten may on barreled razors and horse's buck
No fools no fun bull rider
Live fast die young bull rider
