I know I got words
The world is open wide
I would like to know how come
We should be in tears
Time flies like a bird
The turning of the world
I'd like to go even things are wrong
So long!
Last Good-bye
Time to fly
I don't think I'm lonely one
Last Good-bye
Time to fly
I want things are going fine
I know I got words
The world is open wide
I would like to know how come
We should be in tears
Time flies like a bird
The turning of the world
I'd like to go even things are wrong
So long!
Last Good-bye
Time to fly
I don't think I'm lonely one
Last Good-bye
Time to fly
I want things are going fine
