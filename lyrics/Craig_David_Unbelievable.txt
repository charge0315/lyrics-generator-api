Always said I would know where to find love
Always thought I'd be ready, strong enough
But sometimes I just felt I could give up
But you came and you changed my whole world now
I'm somewhere I've never been before
Now I see what love means

It's so unbelievable
And I don't wanna let it go
Something so beautiful
Flowing down like a waterfall
I feel like you've always been
Forever a part of me
And it's so unbelievable
To finally be in love
Somewhere I never thought I'd be

In my heart, in my head, it's so clear now
Hold my hand, you've got nothing to fear now
I was lost and you've rescued me somehow
I'm alive, I'm in love, you complete me
And I've never been here before
Now I see, ah, what love means

It's so unbelievable (It's so unbelievable)
And I don't wanna let it go (And I don't wanna let it go)
Something so beautiful (Something so beautiful)
Flowing down like a waterfall
I feel like you've always been (I feel like you've always been)
Forever a part of me (Forever a part of me)
And it's so unbelievable (And it's so unbelievable)
To finally be in love
Somewhere I never thought I'd be

When I think of what I have
And this chance I nearly lost
I can't help but break down and cry
Oh yeah, break down and cry, oh
Oh yeah

It's so unbelievable
And I don't wanna let it go
Something so beautiful
Flowing down like a waterfall
I feel like you've always been (I feel like you've always been)
Forever a part of me (Forever a part of me)
And it's so unbelievable (It's so unbelievable)
To finally be in love
Somewhere I never thought I'd be

Now I see what love means
