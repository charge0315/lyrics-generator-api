It could be the first day
When dreams are once again the things that I will have to say
And with my next haze
I'll learn the secrets of the games I've often had to play
And when I finally settle down
To where my spirit can be found
I will call on all my friends
To say I've finally seen the end
It could be the last day
To live in all the places where I've often longed to stay
It could be the last way
To live among the things that I've often talked away
And when I finally realize
Try my new day on for size
I will call on all my friends
To say I've finally seen my eyes
It could be the first day
It could be the last day
It could be the first day
It could be the last day
