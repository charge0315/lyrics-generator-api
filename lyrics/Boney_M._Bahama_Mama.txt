Bahama, Bahama mama
Got the biggest house in town, Bahama mama
Bahama, Bahama mama
But her trouble's getting down, Bahama mama
She has six daughters and not one of them is married yet
And she's looking high and low
And none of them plays ever hard to get
So if you're lonesome: go there, go!
Bahama, Bahama mama
You should all be looking for Bahama mama
Bahama, Bahama mama
And I'm sure you will adore Bahama mama
Bahama, Bahama mama
Got the biggest house in town, Bahama mama
Bahama, Bahama mama
But her trouble's getting down, Bahama mama
You'll meet her daughters, they 'll be treatin' you to honeycake
They'll be sweet and nice to you
And maybe there is one you'd like to take
Well, then you'll know just what to do
Bahama, Bahama mama
She is really in a fix, Bahama mama
Bahama, Bahama mama
Being stuck with all them six, Bahama mama
(What's the matter with men today?
Six beautiful roses and nobody to pluck them
It's a crying shame!) (Hey!
Hey, hey, hey!)
Bahama, Bahama mama
Got the biggest house in town, Bahama mama
Bahama, Bahama mama
But her trouble's getting down, Bahama mama
The thing is: each of them looks like a gorgeous movie queen
Everyone a perfect find
And if a man refused that tempting scene
He simply can't make up his mind
Bahama, Bahama mama
Got the biggest house in town, Bahama mama
Bahama, Bahama mama
But her trouble's getting down, Bahama mama
Bahama, Bahama mama
Got the biggest house in town, Bahama mama
Bahama, Bahama mama
But her trouble's getting down, Bahama mama
(Hey, hey!
Hey!)
