Here we are
Neither one of us caring why
A love so strong, can't be all wrong
‘Cause now we're here together, and I'm so glad
Here we are
With so little time to share
Soon you'll be going back to her, and I'll be going back to him
So hold me closer, tonight

I'm gonna miss you in the morning
I'm gonna miss you in the morning
I'm gonna miss you in the morning
So baby love me tonight
(Oh, I…) (Repeat 4X)
(Oh, I…)(I’m gonna miss ya) (Repeat 4X)
(Oh, I…)(I’m gonna miss ya)(in the morning)(Repeat 3X)
(Oh, I…)(I’m gonna miss ya)
I'm gonna miss you in the morning
I'm gonna miss you in the morning
I'm gonna miss you in the morning
Oh, baby, love me tonight

Here we are, feeling to good for words
I wanna hold back the time
‘Cause living a lie will soon get me down
‘Cause you’re not around

I'm gonna miss you in the morning
I'm gonna miss you in the morning
I'm gonna miss you in the morning…
