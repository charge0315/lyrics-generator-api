In this world of ordinary people
Extraordinary people
I'm glad there is you
In this world of overrated pleasures
Of underrated treasures
I'm so glad there is you
I'll live to love
I'll love to live with you beside me
This role so new
I'll muddle through with you to guide me
In this world
Where many, many play at love
And hardly any stay in love
I'm glad there is you
More than ever
I'm glad there is you
More than ever
I'm glad thеre is you
