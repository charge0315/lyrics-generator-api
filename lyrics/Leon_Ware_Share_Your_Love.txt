Ooh
Yeah, ooh
Ooh
Ooh, ooh yeah
Ooh hoo
Look at the child
When you want to, touch his head
He pays you back in marvelous smiles
That means more than words that's said
(Don't say no, baby) There'll be no way you'll say no
No way of forgetting
Together we'll walk over mountain will go
Together we'll have each earning a home
So share your love
Share your love
While walk away
Share your love
Share your love
It really pays
The wall keeps on knocking you down
The blows get easier
When someone's specials always around
(Don't say no, baby) The more you give love
(Don't say no, baby) The more you get it
(Don't say no, baby) It's a simple fact
(Don't say no, baby) Most people tend to forget
Ooh, share your love
Share your love
While walk away
Ooh, share your love
Share your love
It really pays
You can save it baby
Put it in a bet
Oh, the pleasure you gave
Is being loved back
(Share, share, share, share) Give it to me, give it to me
(Share your love) Yeah some love
(Share, share, share, share) ooh ooh
(Share your love)
(Share, share, share, share) Bring it to me, bring it to me
(Share your love) Don't hold back
Ooh ooh
(Share your love)
Share your love
Ooh ooh
Share your love
