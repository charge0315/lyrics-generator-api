Whispering in his ear
My magic potion for love
Telling him I'm sincere
And that there's nothing too good for us
And I just got to be me, free, free

Whispering in his ear
My magic potion for love
Telling him I'm sincere
And that there's nothing too good for us

But I want to be free, free, free
And I just got to be me, yeah, me, me

Teasing hands on his mind
Give our night such mystery
Happiness all the time
Oh and how that man pleases me

But I want to be free, free, free
And I just got to be me, yeah, me, me

I just got to be me, me, me

Feeling you close to me
Makes all my senses smile
Let's not waste ecstasy
'Cause I'll only be here for a while

I've got to be free, free, free, oh
And I just got to be me, yeah, yeah, me, me, oh

Free, free, free, oh, baby, yeah (I just got to be me, me)
And I just wanna, I just wanna be me
Free, free (I just got to be me, me)
I just got to be me, me
Whoa, free (I just got to be me, me)
Ooh, me, myself and I got to be me
Free, yeah (I just got to be me, me)
Gotta be me, understand I gotta be me
