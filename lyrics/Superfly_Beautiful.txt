Looking in the mirror, staring at my enemy
Every day's a battle with the girl in front of me
I tell her that she's perfect, but she's no good at listening
Some days, it's hard to love her
She never makes it easy, yeah

Those days, I just wanna say to her
"Girl, don't you know that–

"On your worst day, you're still beautiful?
So goddamn beautiful
It's a feeling that you can't let go
Yes, you're so beautiful"

Aren't you gettin' tired, yeah
Of hiding who you're meant to be? Oh, no
Baby, what you don't know
Is you got everything you need, no

One day, someone's gonna say to you
"Hey, don't you know that–

"On your worst day, you're still beautiful?
So goddamn beautiful
It's a feeling that you can't let go
Yes, you're so beautiful (You're so beautiful)
When I look into your eyes, I know
Yes, love can make you whole
Now you're feeling it and watch it grow
Yes, you're so beautiful"

Do you feel beautiful? (Hell yeah)
'Cause you look beautiful tonight
Just feel it in your soul (Hell yeah)
'Cause you are beautiful
Do you feel beautiful? (Hell yeah)
'Cause you look beautiful tonight
Just feel it in your soul (Hell yeah)
'Cause you are beautiful

On your worst day, you're still beautiful
So goddamn beautiful
It's a feeling that you can't let go
Yes, you're so beautiful (You're so beautiful)
When I look into your eyes, I know
Yes, love can make you whole
Now you're feeling it, and watch it grow
Yes, you're so beautiful

Do you feel beautiful? (Hell yeah)
'Cause you look beautiful tonight
Just feel it in your soul (Hell yeah)
'Cause you are beautiful
Do you feel beautiful? (Hell yeah)
'Cause you look beautiful tonight
Just feel it in your soul (Hell yeah)
'Cause you are beautiful
