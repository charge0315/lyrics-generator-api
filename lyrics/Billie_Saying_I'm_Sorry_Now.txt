This is B
First class, y'know
This is B here
Unh, unh, unh, yeah

Nobody knows this but me
All I could see was someone
Who didn't love me for me
How could I have been so dumb?
I tried to act like I knew
You never cared from the start
I gave you problems 'cause I
Knew that you gave me your heart (One, two, whatcha gonna do?)

My baby, my my baby (Ooh)
I wanna come back home (Ooh)
My baby, my, my baby (My baby, my, my baby)
Back to those open arms
I'm everything you want (That you want)
Lord knows I'm everything you need (That you need)
I'll be those promises
That you always said to me (Unh, unh, unh, I said, unh)

If I never told you I need you (Unh, yeah, that's right, I said, unh, yeah, that's right, I said)
I'm sayin' that I need you now (Sayin' I need you now) (Unh, yeah, that's right, I said, unh, yeah, that's right, I said)
If I never told you I'm sorry (Unh, yeah, that's right, I said, unh, yeah, that's right, I said)
I'm sayin' that I'm sorry now (Sayin' I'm sorry now) (Unh, yeah, that's right, I said, unh, unh, unh, yeah)

And now I'm all alone (Bah, bah)
My friends don't understand (Bah, bah)
Is that you can't have a good life
If you can't keep a good man (If you can't keep a good man)
I was a fool back then (Bah, bah)
I tried to be Ms. Strong (Bah, bah)
I let you go when you
Didn't do a damn thing wrong (One, two, whatcha gonna do?)

My baby, my my baby (Ooh)
I wanna come back home (Ooh)
My baby, my, my baby (My baby, my, my baby)
Back to those open arms
I'm everything you want (That you want)
Lord knows I'm everything you need (That you need)
I'll be those promises
That you always said to me (Unh, unh, unh, I said, unh)

If I never told you I need you (Unh, yeah, that's right, I said, unh, yeah, that's right, I said)
I'm sayin' that I need you now (Sayin' I need you now) (Unh, yeah, that's right, I said, unh, yeah, that's right, I said)
If I never told you I'm sorry (Unh, yeah, that's right, I said, unh, yeah, that's right, I said)
I'm sayin' that I'm sorry now (Sayin' I'm sorry now) (Unh, yeah, that's right, I said, unh, unh, unh, yeah)

Deep down, you know, you know I'm sorry (Why, why?)
Deep down, you know, you know I'm sorry (Why did I let you go?)
Deep down, you know, you know I'm sorry (Why, why? Why, why?)
Deep down, you know, you know I'm sorry (Why did I let you go?)

My baby, my my baby (Ooh)
I wanna come back home (Ooh)
My baby, my, my baby (My baby, my, my baby)
Back to those open arms
I'm everything you want (That you want)
Lord knows I'm everything you need (That you need)
I'll be those promises
That you always said to me (Unh, unh, unh, I said)
