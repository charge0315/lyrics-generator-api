Goin' to a go-go
Goin' to a go-go
Na na na na, yeah

Well, there's a brand new place I've found
Where people go from miles around
They come from everywhere
And if you drop in there
You might see anyone in town

Goin' to a go-go
(Everybody's)
Goin' to a go-go
(Come on, now)
Don't you want to go
(Yeah!
One more time, yeah)
(I'm) Goin' to a go-go
(Ooh, ooh, whee)
Goin' to a go-go
(Baby, come on now)

It doesn't matter (Go-go) where you are
A go-go (Go-go) can't be far
You'll see the people (Go-go) from your block
And don't be shocked
If you see your (Go-go) favorite star

Goin' to a go-go
('Cause everybody's)
Goin' to a go-go
(Oh, come on now)
Don't you want to go
(Yeah, people, come on)

Na na na na, yeah
Tell me, don't you want to go
Yeah!
Now, it's all right

I'm goin' to a go-go
Yes I am
Goin' to a go-go
Oh, come on now

It doesn't matter if you go stag-uh (Go-go)
It doesn't matter if you go drag-uh (Go-go)
You're sure to have some fun (Go-go)
I'm telling everyone (Go-go)
Most every taxi that you flag is (Go-go)

Goin' to a go-go
(Oh, come on baby)
Goin' to a go-go
(Baby, come on now)
Don't you want to go
(Yeah
One more time, yeah)
I'm goin' to a go-go
(Ooh, ooh, whee)
Goin' to a go-go
(Baby, come on now)
Goin' to a go-go
(Come on, baby)
Goin' to a go-go

Goin' to a go-go
