Hahahahaha!

I can't hide, no, on the mantle
I'm not sad until I'm home
It's the season, I'm all reason
I have seen all I have grown

Sheared at the seams
Cheat on me
Cheat on me
Cheat on me
And not seen
And not seen
And not seen
Cheat on me
At the seams

I'm a lantern, I'm a planter
I set something in the garden
In the handle, on the mantle
I love Santa, I met God

Sheared at the seams
Cheat on me
Cheat on me
Cheat on me
Cheat on me
At the seams
At the seams
At the seams
Cheat on me

I'm a lady, can you save me?
It's the sulfur, I have drunk
'Tis the season and I'm all reason
I have fleas so run on home

Sheared at the seams
Cheat on me
Cheat on me
Cheat on me
Cheat on me
Cheat on me
Cheat on me
At the seams
At the seams
Cheat on me
