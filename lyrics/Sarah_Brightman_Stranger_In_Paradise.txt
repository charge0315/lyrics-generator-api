Take my hand
I'm a stranger in paradise
All lost in a wonderland
A stranger in paradise
If I stand starry-eyed
There's a danger in paradise
For mortals who stand beside
An angel like you

I saw your face ascended
Out of the commonplace and into the rare
Now somewhere out in space I hang suspended
Until I'm certain that there's a chance that you care

Won't you answer the fervent prayer
Of a stranger in paradise?
Don't send me in dark despair
From all that I hunger for
But open your angel's arms
To the stranger in paradise
And tell him that he need be
A stranger no more

Take my hand
I'm a stranger in paradise
All lost in a wonderland
A stranger in paradise
If I stand starry-eyed
There's a danger in paradise
For mortals who stand beside
An angel like you

I saw your face ascended
Out of the commonplace and into the rare
Now somewhere out in space I hang suspended
Until I'm certain that there's a chance that you care

Won't you answer the fervent prayer
Of a stranger in paradise?
Don't send me in dark despair
From all that I hunger for
But open your angel's arms
To the stranger in paradise
And tell him that he need be
A stranger no more

A stranger no more
