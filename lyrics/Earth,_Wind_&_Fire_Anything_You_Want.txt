You were so right all along
I wouldn't believe 'til love had gone
Replacing the old with the new
And now that I want to see it through
You tell me you care
He's still inside your heart
It's tearing me apart
That I'm anything you want

I'll be there to listen to everything you cry
All you need
Ever to believe in you without a reason why
Baby, for your love
I'll be near to be with you to wipe the tear away
Though it's hard for me
I'm anything you want
(I'll be anything, I'll be anything, I'll be anything)
Baby, it was so wrong and we both knew
And yet it was all that I could do
You were living a life you could not feel
Thinking he was the way to make it real
You can't let him go
I'm still a part of you
I'll do what I must do, hey
Anything, anything you want
I'll be there to listen to everything you cry
All you need
Ever to believe in you without a reason why
Baby, for your love
I'll be near to be with you to wipe the tear away
You know it's so hard for me, hard for me
To be anything you want

Every time you talk about him
You'll never know how it hurts my, hurts my heart
But I'll be there for you, baby
He's still inside your heart
It's tearing me apart
Anything you want
I'll be there to listen to everything you cry
Baby, all you need
Ever to believe in you without a reason why
For your love
I'll be near to be with you to wipe the tear away
(I'll be anything, I'll be anything, I'll be anything)
Anything you want, yeah
(I'll be anything, I'll be anything, I'll be anything)
All you need
(I'll be anything, I'll be anything, I'll be anything)
Anything you want
(I'll be anything, I'll be anything, I'll be anything)
Anything
