Are we really sure
Can a love that lasted for so long
Still endure?
Do I really care?
Hey, hey, let's talk about the distractions
Goin' on elsewhere

I keep hearin' footsteps, baby
In the dark, oh, in the dark
Why? I keep hearin' footsteps, baby
In the dark, oh, in the dark, ooh

My mind drifts now and then
Lookin' down dark corridors and wonders what might have been
Something's up ahead
Hey, should I keep this same direction or go back instead?

I, I keep hearin' footsteps, baby
In the dark, oh, in the dark
Why? I keep hearin' footsteps, baby
In the dark, oh, in the dark, ooh

Honey, now let's stop walkin' around
When there's love lost to be found
Oh, and you know I still care, I still care
What's the sense in goin' elsewhere?

Who feels really sure?
Can that feelin' guarantee your happiness shall endure?
And do we, really care? Hey, hey
Let's look at what's been happenin', try to be more aware

I, I keep hearin' footsteps, baby
In the dark, in the dark
Why? I keep hearin' footsteps, baby
In the dark, oh, in the dark, ooh

Yeah, let's stop walkin' around
Well, when there's love lost, lost to be found
Oh, honey, you know I still care, I still care
What's the sense in goin', goin' elsewhere?

Oh, honey, let's stop walkin' around and around and around
When there's no love to be found
Hey, baby, you know, I still care, I still care
What's the sense of goin', goin' elsewhere?
