I won't say a word about my nightmares
'Cause I'm scared I could pass them on to you
I just need to tidy up my mind
So they can hide where they can't be found
If I talk, you'll turn my stories upside down
And read the signs where there's nothing to see
You can keep the rest all for yourself
But I'll keep mine like a book on the shelf
I'll write you a letter, send you a picture
When there's a change in the weather
I'll, sooner or later, see everything clearer
When I feel a little better
I don't know if you can wait for a while
If you've been hurt and it might take some time
I ain't runnin' away, I'm just goin' underground
But one day, I'll come back around
I'll write you a letter, send you a picture
When there's a change in the weather
I'll, sooner or later, see everything clearer
When I feel a little better
When I feel a little better
It's only a nightmare, don't you worry
It's only a nightmare, don't you worry
It's only a nightmare, don't you worry
It's only a nightmare, don't you worry
It's only a nightmare, don't you worry
It's only a nightmare
I'll write you a letter, send you a picture
When there's a change in the weather
I'll, sooner or later, see everything clearer
When I feel a little better
When I feel a little better
When I feel a little better
When I feel a little better
