Alright
Yea I'm gonna tell ya a story 'bout this cat
His name was Dirty
And, uh, he lived down the street from me
Second house, shotgun house
You can check this out, OK
He's not around anymore
No his name was Dirty
He was slick and thought he was purty
Wide hats and women
Wore anything that was tight and he could fit in
Had a way with numbers
Ran 'em so unencumbered
Had a reputation
But love inflation
You see that was his employment
As he worked for enjoyment
Tell ya bout dirty (he's not around anymore)
Tell ya bout dirty (dirty)
