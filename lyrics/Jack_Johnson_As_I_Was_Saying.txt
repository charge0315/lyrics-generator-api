As I was saying
Just before you left the room before
Before I assumed that you might not
Come around
As I was saying
Just after I took my foot from
My mouth and put it back
On the ground

Well I don't want to disappoint you
And I don't want to disappear
From here or now or you

This is worth saving
'Cause the sum of us is more than us
If you add us up then subtract
My lack of sleep
'Cause my mind feels crazy
When all these thoughts come rushing in
Should I be trusting them or
Only let them be?

'Cause I don't want to disappoint you
And I don't want to disappear
From here or now or you

Is it just a matter of time?
Does it even matter at all?
'Cause even if this story should fall from the sky to the sea
If I should fall, would you fall down with me?
Would you fall with me?

Found my foundation
It was underneath me all alone
On this path I'm on, now I
Never walk alone
And I've been erasing
Rewrote the second half like this
So my protagonist might find
His way back home

And I don't want to disappoint you
I don't want to disappear
From here or now or you
No, not from here or now or you
