Your precious sweetheart, she is so faithful
She is so true, woah, yeah
Her dreams are tumbling
Her world is crumbling
Because of you, uh-huh
One day, you'll hurt her just once too much
And when you finally lose your tender touch

Shoo-be-doo-be-doo-be-doo-da-day
Her feet may wander, her heart may stray
Shoo-be-doo-be-doo-be-doo-da-dee
You're gonna send your baby straight to me

I'm gonna give her all the loving
Within my heart, oh, yeah
I'm gonna patch up every single little dream
You've torn apart, understand me now?
And when she tells you, she's crying her last tear
Heaven knows I am going to be somewhere near

Shoo-be-doo-be-doo-be-doo-da-day
Her feet may wander, her heart may stray
Shoo-be-doo-be-doo-be-doo-da-dee
That's gonna send your baby straight to me
Oh, yeah-yeah, you better
You better listen to me, yeah

Heartaches are calling and tears are falling
Because of you, oh, yeah
And when you're gone, she'll know
I'm the one to go to her rescue
Maybe you didn't know that man
You're gonna leave her one too many times
And when you come back, that girl's gonna be mine, all mine
