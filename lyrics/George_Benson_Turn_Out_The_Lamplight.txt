Coming home is always joy to me
Ain't a place that I would rather be
I need to see the heaven in your eyes
'Cause you're the love that's always hard to find
Every dream that's ever crossed my mind
Only you can make the day end right

So turn out the lamplight (Turn out the lamplight)
Sit by my side
Love me tonight
Turn out the lamplight (Turn out the lamplight)
Let's dream for a while
Just you and I
And we'll let the world go spinning by
(Turn out the lamplight) Hoo

On a day when problems get me down
It's nice to think about the love we found
All I need is you and I'll get by
And though the years may make me old and grey
Darling, you still take my breath away
'Cause time can't change the warmth inside your smile

So turn out the lamplight (Turn out the lamplight)
Sit by my side
Love me tonight
Turn out the lamplight (Turn out the lamplight)
Let's dream for a while
Just you and I
And we'll let the world go spinning by
(Turn out the lamplight) Hoo, hoo

(Turn out the lamplight) Sit here by my side
Sit by my side and love me, love me tonight
(Turn out the lamplight) Turn out the lamplights, and let's dream
(Turn out the lamplight) Let's dream for a while
Just you and I (Turn out the lamplight)
Ooh, oh, oh, sit by my side
