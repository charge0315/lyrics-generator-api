Trust me for I will never leave you cold
Lonely in the night
Trust me for I will bring good fortune
And you know I'm always right
Woo-oo-oo
Oh darling is there nothing I can do
Do you hear me
As always those dark clouds fill your skies
Won't you let me come inside
Our tears have left me weak and breathless
And I don't know what to say
Our years have made us both so reckless
Does it have to be that way
Woo-oo-oo
Oh darling this bough is bending low
Deep water
Please tell me if there's somеthing I should know
What can I do that really matters
If you don't trust me
Oh darling is thеre nothing I can do
Do you hear me
As always those dark clouds, oh my, my
Won't you let me come inside
