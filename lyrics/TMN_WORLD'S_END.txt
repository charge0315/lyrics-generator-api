Step in to the garden
We're gonna lock the gate
We gotta keep out the sinners
We gotta keep out the hate
Look at the horizon
The time is coming near
Look out at the world on fire
Look at the people frozen in fear

We won't listen to their crying
They had their chance to see the light
We won't be handing out no pardons
'Cause the world is gonna end tonight

See the rabbits running
See the mountains shake
Now the sea is flooding
And the earth begins to quake
Hear the boom of thunder
It sounds just like the voice
They should have listened closer when they went and made that choice

We won't listen to their screaming
They had their chance to do what's right
They'll be begging for forgiveness
'Cause the world is gonna end tonight

Those non-believers out by the path
They're gonna burn forever
They're gonna burn to ash
So take heed young heathen, listen to me close
You're either in or out and you're stuck with what you chose

We won't listen to your begging
You had your chance to stand and fight
And now you'll end your days in darkness
'Cause the world is gonna end tonight
