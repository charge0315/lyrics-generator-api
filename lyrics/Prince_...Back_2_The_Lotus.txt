From a lotus flower
Somewhere in the South Pacific
Corner of my studio
From up in the clouds, the enemy of your seed
Performs a righteous deed
It looks a little gray to the atmosphere
That's been corrupted by the impure
Cleansing all the airways
Don't fret
It's done at this point
Over
All right
What?
How are the plants?
And the lotus flower
Somewhere in the South Pacific
Corner of my studio
