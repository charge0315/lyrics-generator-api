Photogenic memory
Past looks better than reality
Believe me, it's just an illusion
Photogenic memory
Makes it better than it used to be
Believe me, you're better without him
You see her leave with him
You want him back again
But remember what your life was like
You can't forget the nights
You forget the lies and fights
You remember only the good times
Photogenic memory
Makes it better than it used to be
Believe me, you're better without him
Yesterday you'd have done him harm
Now you wanna be on his arm
Remember the way he pretended
Yesterday he was history
Now today he's all you see
You remember the way that it ended
Photogenic memory
Past looks better than reality
Believe me, it's just an illusion
Photogenic memory
Makes it better than it used to be
Believe me, you're better without him
Slip away before you fall
Rip the phone out of the wall when he calls
Anything to keep him out
Out of your new life that he inspires
Photogenic memory
Past looks better than reality

Slip away before you fall
Rip the phone out of the wall when he calls
Anything to keep him out
Out of your new life that he inspires
