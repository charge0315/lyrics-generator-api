Somebody somewhere
In the heat of the night
Looking pretty dangerous
Running out of patience

Tonight in the city
You won't find any pity
Hearts are being twisted
Another lover cheated, cheated

In the bars and the cafes (Passion)
In the streets and the alleys (Passion)
A lot of pretending (Passion)
Everybody searching (Passion)

Once in love, you're never out of danger
One hot night spent with a stranger
All you wanted was somebody to hold on to, yeah
(Passion, passion)
(Passion, passion)

New York, Moscow (Passion)
Hong Kong, Tokyo (Passion)
Paris and Bangkok (Passion)
A lotta people ain't got (Passion)
Hear it in the radio (Passion)
Read it in the papers (Passion)
Hear it in the churches (Passion)
See it in the schoolyards (Passion)

Once in love, you're never out of danger
One hot night spent with a stranger
All you wanted was somebody to hold on to, yeah
Once in love, you're never out of danger
One hot night spent with a stranger
All you wanted was somebody to hold on to

Alone in your bed at night (Passion)
It's half past midnight (Passion)
As you turn out your sidelight (Passion)
Something ain't right (Passion)
There's no passion, there's no passion
There's no passion, I need passion
You need passion, we need passion
Can't live without passion
Won't live without passion
Can't live without passion

Even the president needs passion
Everybody I know needs some passion
Some people die and kill for passion
Nobody admits they need passion
Some people are scared of passion
Yeah, passion
