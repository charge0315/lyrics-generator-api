I remember when, as a child
I used to stop and stare
Looking in the sky, wondering
How did my life compare
So I found through my desire
I could take it to the sky, baby
Now my heart can fly
Time moved on and then
Life and I became the best of friends
There's no limit to
All the smiles in life that's in store for you
So I found through my desire
I could take it to the sky, baby
Now my heart can fly
Now my heart can fly
Life is a word you live
Strong as the vibes you give, baby
Yeah, living in happiness is knowing
That you've been blessed, oo yeah
Ohh, learning to fly, it seems
Is learning to live your dreams, oh yeah
Take it to the sky
Learn the reason why, baby
Then your heart can fly
