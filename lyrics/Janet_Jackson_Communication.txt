It's traveling faster than the eye can see
Information in the sky
Messages beamed across the atmosphere
Transmitted by you and I

Communication
Say the words, are you there? Can I be heard?
Person to person
Heart to heart, come together, worlds apart

Oh, thank heavens for the microwave
Can't ignore technology
It's so easy to communicate
How come you're not hearing me?

Communication
Say the words, are you there? Can I be heard?
Person to person
Heart to heart, come together, worlds apart
Station to station
Coast to coast, face to face will tell you most
(Would you leave a message? Sorry)

Now we're living in the computer age
The picture's on my video
I keep your number In my database
Turn it on to audio

Communication
Say the words, are you there? Can I be heard?
(Why don't you say that you need me?)
Person to person
Heart to heart, come together, worlds apart

Communication
Say the words, are you there? Can I be heard?
Person to person
Heart to heart, come together, worlds apart
Station to station
Coast to coast, face to face will tell you most

Communication
Say the words, are you there? Can I be heard?
Communication, baby
Heart to heart, come together, worlds apart

Communication
Say the words, are you there? Can I be heard? (Why don't you say it, babe, why don't you say it, babe?, why don't you say it, babe?)
Communication (Why don't you say it, babe?)

Heart to heart, come together, worlds apart
Communication (Baby)
