We spend so much time
Inside these four walls
Watching TV
Or lost in technology
I need a change of scene
To step inside a different dream
Remember how things used to be?
It’s a beautiful day
Let’s go outside and play
Let’s run through sprinklers
Race a Pinewood Derby
Eat cotton candy
Drink a Slurpie
Let’s look for worms
Near a fishing hole
Catch a crawdad in a Mason jar
Chew cigar gum
Trade Matchbox cars
Play ball and jacks
Let’s ride on our bikes
‘Kiss’ cards in the spokes
Go clickety-clack
Clickety-clack
Clickety-clack
We need a change of scene
Let’s step inside a different dream
Remember how things used to be?
It’s a beautiful day
Let’s go outside…
Let’s run through sprinklers
Race a Pinewood Derby
Eat cotton candy
Slurp a Slurpie
We’ll watch cartoons
On Saturdays
And ice cream Sundays
Make real big fun days
You’ll make a splash
With a cannonball
I’ll make you laugh
Say, “Hey” like The Fonz
Eat pizza and play pinball
Go where we want to
Do what we want to
Go where we want to
Do what we want to
(where we want to when we want to)
Let’s run through sprinklers
Race a Pinewood Derby
Eat cotton candy
Slurp a Slurpie
Let’s dig for worms
Near a fishing hole
Catch a crawdad in a Mason jar
Chew cigar gum
Trade Matchbox cars
Play ball and jacks
Let’s ride on our bikes
‘Kiss’ cards in the spokes
Go clickety-clack
Clickety-clack
Clickety-clack
Say, “Hey” like The Fonz
Eat pizza and play pinball
