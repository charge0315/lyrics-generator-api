In your eyes, I see only one
Find me the place for us, that's where I belong
There we rise, your glory and mine
Your pain is over now, I make you shine
Still believing

All the love in the world won't take me away from you
My love is stronger, I am what you make me
All the love in the world won't take you away from me
In all my wonder, I forever lay down here with you

I find when love slips away
Reach out for all you can before it's too late
There you fly returnin' to me
Out of your darkest nights, I stand alone
Still believing

All the love in the world won't take me away from you
My love is stronger, I forever lay down here with you

My love is true
All your darkest nights, I stand alone
Still believing

All the love in the world won't take me away from you
My love is stronger, I forever lay down here with you
All the love in the world won't take me away from you
My love is stronger, I forever lay down here with you
All the love in the world won't take me away from you
