Wake up and we touchin' but I can't feel
I got too many problems I put off still for the mornin'
I'm thinkin' 'bout your body
Wake up in the mornin' and to your smell
There's somethin' that I know all too well, now we yawnin'
It's early in the mornin'
I know that your love, baby, is a mystery
I want you all over me
I'll be honest baby, it ain't stoppin' me
From watching that body
From watching that body
I'll be honest baby, it ain't stoppin' me
From watching that body
From watching that body
Wake up in the mornin' and to your smell
There's somethin' that I know all too well, now we yawnin'
It's early in the mornin'
