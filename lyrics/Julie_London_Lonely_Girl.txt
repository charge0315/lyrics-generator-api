I'd love to meet some boy
Whom I'd love because I'm such a lonely
Lonely girl

I'd like to be the girl
Some guy liked to call his one and only
Only girl

He doesn't have to be especially handsome
As long as he cares for me and he's kind of romance-some

Please try to understand why I cry
It's 'cause I'm such a lonely
Lonely girl

Lonely girl
Lonely girl
