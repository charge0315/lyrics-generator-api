I stalked you for so long
You watched me just as stro-o-ong
It feels right bein' wro-o-ong
Never thought I'd get you, no, but here you are at my front door

The less you show, the more you get
It doesn't matter if you're feelin' it
Put down your phone, don't send that pic
They won't come back unless they're missin' it

But now that I got ya
It keeps gettin' hotter
I don't want a water (Oh)

My mind's blown (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
My mind's blown (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Down to my toes (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
My mind's blown (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah)

I'll never let you go (Never let you go)
My sweet tooth is too stro-o-ong, yeah
Your sugar is my home (Sugar is my home)
Never thought I'd get you, no, but here you are at my front door

The less you show, the more you get
It doesn't matter if you're feelin' it
Put down your phone (Put down that phone)
Don't send that pic (Don't send that pic)
They won't come back unless they're missin' it

But now that I got ya
It keeps gettin' hotter
I don't want a water (Ow)

My mind's blown (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
My mind's blown (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Down to my toes (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
My mind's blown (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)

I know you act like you don't want it (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Girl, I know you need it (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
'Cause you be actin' like my woman (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Every time you see me (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh), my mind blown

I wanna pebble, I wanna marble, I wanna stone, I wanna rock, rock right now
I rock bass, so she came to get down, she said, "In honesty, he wasn't fly when I met him"
She said, "You're separate, Kent, you're fly on another level," I call her Melody 'cause I got her hittin' falsetto
She said, "No strings attached," so Geppetto had a couple side puppets just to make her feel special (
My mind's blown
)
I like girls that niggas look at on the comment, on my mama, Keke Palmer, I'm just bein' honest
She gon' play hard-to-get, now that she know I want it, but I'm sure to break her off before I break a promise
Leavin' Memphis, on my way to Nash', head while I'm drivin', almost made me crash
I hate smart-mouth girls that fuck the vibe up, she jumped out the window and hit the Stacey Dash (Ow)

But now that I got ya
It keeps gettin' hotter
I don't want a water (Ow)

My mind's blown (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
My mind's blown (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, hey)
Down to my toes (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, hey, ha)
My mind's blown (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, oh)

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (Come on)
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (Oh, my mind's blown)
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (Hey)
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (Yeah, yeah, my mind's blown)
