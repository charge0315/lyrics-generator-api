For once in my life, I have someone who needs me
Someone I've needed so long
For once, unafraid, I can go where life leads me
And somehow I know I'll be strong
For once, I can touch what my heart used to dream of
Long before I knew someone warm like you (Mm)
Who could make my dreams come true

For once in my life, I won't let sorrow hurt me
Not like it's hurt me before
For once, I have somеone I know won't desert mе
I'm not alone anymore
For once I can say, "This is mine, you can't take it
Long as I know I have love, I can make it"
For once in my life, I have someone who needs me
Haha

For once I can say, "This is mine, you can't take it
Long as I know I have love, I can make it"
For once in my life I have someone who needs me
For once in my life, for once in my life
I have someone, someone, ooh, I've got someone
Who needs me
Wow, Stevie Wonder-ful
The great Tony Bennett
Haha
Happy birthday
Thank you
