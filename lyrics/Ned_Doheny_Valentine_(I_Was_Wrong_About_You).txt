Valentine, my heart keeps on aching
Make-believe can bring such uneasy peace
In a moment, it can slip away
Is there nothing that we have to say?
Valentine, my luck has outrun me
What little I bought I lost in the fray
In a moment, I may lose the rest
Are you nowhere near? I must confess
That I was wrong about you
Had no right to doubt you
So when the feeling runs me through
I write the words in blue
Valentine, I'll always be waiting
Down the line, you'll always be there for me
Come whatever we must face each day
There's just one thing that I've left to say:
That I was wrong about you
Had no right to doubt you
So when the feeling runs me through
I write the words in blue
Love's the last to go
Love's the last to go
Love's the last to go
Love's the last to go
You know, I
(Love's the last to go)
Hate to say it, hate to say it
(Love's the last to go)
Hate to say it, hate to say it
(Love's the last to go)
Hate to say it, hate to say it
(Love's the last to go)
Hate to say it, hate to say it
(Love's the last to go)
