From too much talk to silent touches
Sweet touches
We turned our hearts to love, then tried it
First time romance
There in the quiet, love learns to dance

We loved, we slept, we left the lights on
The night's gone
And morning finds us caught in life's most sensible trance
Turn up the quiet, love wants to dance

Old souls on a new life
And hearts that are listening like ours
And old dreams find young wings
In silence, in silence

From too much talk to loving touches
Love touches
When pure emotion takes the moment
We take the chance
Turn up the quiet, love wants to dance

Love wants to dance
