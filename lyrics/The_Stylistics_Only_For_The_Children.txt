Give
All that you have to give
When she has strained you
And bitterly blamed you
'Cause she's so unhappy
Give
Swallowing compromise
Though it won't matter
You'll soon hear the chatter of her
Whining mouth, but you
Somehow supply
All the demands that never seem to end
You try to withstand
All of her moods, her childish attitudes

Only for the children
I'll keep love alive
'Cause it's only for the children
My love, survives

Give
Though it means sacrifice
You feel temptation
But your imitation of hope
Must satisfy you
Give
Though it means you ignore
The lack of affection
And constant rejection bestown
Though it hurts you
I swallow my pride, tossed it aside
Though deep inside of me
I feel like a liar
Living this lie knowing it has to be

Only for the children
I'll keep love alive
'Cause it's only for the children
Our love survives

 X3
Only for the children
I'll keep love alive
'Cause it's only for the children
My love, survives
