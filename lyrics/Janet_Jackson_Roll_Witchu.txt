Roll it, stop
Roll it, stop
Roll it and drop
Baby, now rock it with me
Roll it, stop
Roll it, stop
Roll it and drop
Baby, now rock it with me

Oh baby, oh baby pop
Follow my directions
You will be okay
Roll with it, roll with it, stop
When you do it right
You'll see it on my face
Gotta one: let it drop
Two: make it hot
Three: don't you stop
'Til you hit that spot tonight
Let's go on, let it rock
Ready or not
Come on, baby, ride on it
Come on, lay that vibe on it

Can I just roll withchu
Out on the floor witchu?
Oh, the sexy way you move
Layin' it down
Takin' it slow witchu
Like when the flow is smooth
Keepin' it inside the mood
Layin' it down
Love everything you do
Wanna do it all night witchu
And truly go home with you
Layin' it down
Can I just roll withchu
Out on the floor witchu?
Oh, the sexy way you move
Layin' it down

Roll, baby, roll with it, drop
That extra little thing that you do; it drives me crazy
Now roll with it, roll, baby, drop
Doing different moves that keep drivin' me insane
Close in four, let it rock
Five on top
Six: don't you stop
'Til you hit the spot tonight
Let's go and let it rock
Ready or not
Come on, baby, ride on it
Come on, lay that vibe on it

Can I just roll withchu
Out on the floor witchu?
Oh, the sexy way you move
Layin' it down
Takin' it slow witchu
Like when the flow is smooth
Keepin' it inside the mood
Layin' it down
Love everything you do
Wanna do it all night witchu
And truly go home with you
Layin' it down
Can I just roll withchu
Out on the floor witchu?
Oh, the sexy way you move
Layin' it down

Roll it, stop
Roll it, stop
Roll it and drop
Baby, now rock it with me
Roll it, stop
Roll it, stop
Roll it and drop
Baby now rock it with me

Anytime we're dancin'
Ain't no holdin' back
Our bodies start to react
Just let go and be free (I get the feelin')
When you're dancing close to me (Keepin' the rhythm)
I feel you all over me
You make me feel so right
When you're holding me tight
Roll with it, wanna roll witchu
Baby, tonight

I wanna roll witchu
Dance slow witchu
I wanna roll witchu
Get low witchu
Baby

Can I just roll withchu
Out on the floor witchu?
Oh, the sexy way you move
Layin' it down
Takin' it slow witchu
Like when the flow is smooth
Keepin' it inside the mood
Layin' it down
Love everything you do
Wanna do it all night witchu
And truly go home with you
Layin' it down
Can I just roll withchu
Out on the floor witchu?
Oh, the sexy way you move
Layin' it down
Can I just roll withchu
Out on the floor witchu?
Oh, the sexy way you move
Layin' it down
Takin' it slow witchu
Like when the flow is smooth
Keepin' it inside the mood
Layin' it down
Love everything you do
Wanna do it all night witchu
And truly go home with you
Layin' it down
Can I just roll withchu
Out on the floor witchu?
Oh, the sexy way you move
Layin' it down
