Did you ever tell somebody you're in love
Like the way I'm telling you I'm in love
With you
Baby baby with you
I'm in love
I'm in love
I'm in love
I'm in love
Love
Love
With you
You can tell me how it feels to be loved
Only I can tell you how it feels to be loved
By you
Believe me baby baby by you
To be loved
To be loved
To be loved
To be loved
Loved
Loved
By you
Oh I life can be short
Of that there's no doubt
However I'm not pushed for time
If you can't come out till
Round about nine
When that sun don't shine for me I won't care
Only sunshine that I'll need is waiting there
With you
Believe me baby, baby with you
Waiting there
Waiting there
Waiting there
Waiting there
There
There
With you
