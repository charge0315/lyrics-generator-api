African heartbeat, oh what a dance
African heartbeat, I wanna dance
Born in Africa, children of the sun
Walk upon this Earth as the chosen ones
Guided by the light of an eastern moon
The fire of the dance is alive in you
African heartbeat, oh what a dance
African heartbeat, I wanna dance
Lion in your heart, eagle in your eye
Awaken to the dawn of eternal life
Let your spirits beat to a distant drum
Dreams of Africa, children of the sun
I will dream of Africa
Joy to the children, let freedom ring
My heart beats strong for Africa
Child of creation, the song of a nation is calling us to dance
African heartbeat, oh what a dance
African heartbeat, I wanna dance
Let's ride the wings of Isis upon the wind
From the Valley of the Kings where the dance begin
This will be your land, prince of ebony
Stars above the the desert watch over me
Let's sing a song of Africa
Raise up our voices and touch the sun
My heart beats strong for Africa
Joy to the child, the gift of the wild, bring light into this land
I dream of Africa, children of the ray
I dream of Africa, your time will come again
Boat upon the river, take my heart to paradise
Ashes from the fire rising high into the sky
Ancient song, take me back in time
We will dream of Africa
Joy to the children, let freedom ring
My heart beats strong for Africa
Africa, oh Africa
Give your heart and spread the word of love right across the land
Africa, oh Africa
Talking drums are calling us to dance
Send your dreams to Africa
Free as the lion forever more
Dreams are made in Africa
Sing a song of Africa
My heart beats strong for Africa
