Our love is the power
Through the darkest hour
Free your heart today
Now is the time to step away
Through the night, our love will shine
You and I shining bright
Our love is the power
Through the darkest hour
Dream until the dawn
Knowing the love will keep us warm
Heaven is nigh
Just hold on tight
Reach the sky...
Hold the dawn
Keep us strong
Keep on
Stay True!
Free your heart today
Now is the time to slip away
Through the night our love will shine
You and I
Shining Bright
Hold tight to the Guiding Light
Til the loving, sharing
Ahhhhhhhhh
Our love is the power
Through the darkest hour
Our love is the power
Through the darkest hour
Dreamin til the dawn

Heaven comes to you

Nothing will go wrong

And Love will see you through

Dreamin til the dawn
