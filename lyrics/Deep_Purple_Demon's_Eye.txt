I don't mind just what you say
I never heard you, baby, never heard you anyway
I don't care what you do
Just so long as it ain't me and you

Sly, sly, like a demon's eye

Everything's good, I said, everything's fine
You don't know, don't know it's the end of your time
How does it feel to be turned away?
I've known it, baby, almost every day

Sly, sly, like a demon's eye

I don't need you anymore
I don't want you, baby, hanging round my door
You slip and slide round my brain
You think you're so clever, yeah, but you know you're insane

Sly, sly, like a demon's eye

I d-d-don't mind just what you say
I never heard you, I never heard you anyway, no I didn't
Everything's good, everything's fine
You don't know, it's the end of your time

Sly, sly, like a demon's eye
Like a demon's eye

Oh oh yeah, you're so sly baby yeah ooh yeah
You make me feel upside down, oh
Like a demons eye, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh!!
