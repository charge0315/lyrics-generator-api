Oh, the good life
Full of fun, seems to be the ideal
Yes, the good life
Lets you hide all the sadness you feel
You won't really fall in love
Or you can't take the chance
So please, be honest with yourself
Don't try to fake romance
It's the good life
To be free and explore the unknown
Like the heartaches when you learn
You must face them alone
Please, remember I still want you
And in case you wonder why
Well, just wake up, kiss the good life
Goodbye
You just wake up, kiss the good life
Goodbye
