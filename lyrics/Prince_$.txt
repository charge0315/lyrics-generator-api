Here she come, the most popular girl in the whole wide world today
You don't know if she would, but what's good is she'd come and look your way
You're standing over there trying to be gangster, copping your favorite lean
You give her the head nod
Oh my god, you're the craziest thing she's ever seen

But you’re dancing
And she's loving you all night long
In your little world, she's your best girl
It's all money, ain't nothing wrong
You’re dancing
Oh, she's loving you all night long
Funky dollar bill, it's real, y'all
Easy come, easy gone

Where you go, everybody want to know
So they can put it in a magazine
Next to the ad for the latest fad
In black hair care – Vaseline
With this car, these rims, this grill
You'll be the illest on the scene
Whatever whatever, all you need is your music
And you'll be a party machine

'Cause you'll be dancing
Mm, she'll be loving you all night long
In your little world, she's your best girl
It's money, ain't nothing wrong
You're dancing, yes, you are
She's loving you all night long
Funky dollar bill, it's real, y'all
Easy come, easy gone
Mmm
One, two

How many times you look for happy
And you never see the rich folks there?
But if the DJ really dropped a needle
All the true players just don't care
When all the news just give me the blues
And make you wanna pop a pill
What difference does it make who gots the most bank?
It's just ink and chlorophyll

Everybody's dancing, ooh Lord
And loving you all night long
In your little world, she's your best girl
It's all money, ain't nothing wrong
You're dancing, oohee
And loving you all night long
Funky dollar bill, it's real, y'all
Easy come, easy gone
Dancing, dancing
She’s loving you all night long
In your little world, she's your best girl
Your best girl, oh, it’s my name, my name
Dancing, yes sir
Loving you all night long
Easy come, easy gone
We got this
Nah, we got this
Listen

Pawns aside, who's the king of two and fo’
Wit’ hot sauce from the bay to Baltimo'?
Take your woman ‘fore she hit the front do’
And whoop your whole crew 'cause they fat and slow
Short
Oh, yeah, right, exactly
That’s all you got to rhyme with that?
Let me see
Dancing, whoo
Loving you all night long
It's all money
Ain't nothing wrong
Dancing
Loving you all night long
Easy come, easy gone
Dancing
Loving you all night long
It’s all money
Ain’t nothing wrong
Dancing
Loving you all night long
