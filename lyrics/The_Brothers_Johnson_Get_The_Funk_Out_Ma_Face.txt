Hi
Hello

Get the funk out of my face, get the funk out my face
Get the funk out of my face, get the funk out my face

You don't like my music? You don't have to use it
Funking is a thing that all of us release
You don't have to get it, all you do is let it
Then you'll know exactly how to groove

You don't like my music? You don't have to use it
Funking is a thing that all of us release
You don't have to play it, you don't have to say it
You don't even have to try to sing

Get the funk out my face, get the funk out my face (Out my face!)
Get the funk out my face, get the funk out my face
Get the funk out my face, get the funk out my face (Out my face!)
Get the funk out my face, get the funk out my face

You don't like my music? You don't have to use it
Funking is a thing that all of us release
You don't have to get it, all you do is let it
Then tell us our funk did you some good

You don't like my music? You don't have to use it
Funking is a thing that all of us release
You don't have to get it, all you do is let it
Then you'll know exactly how to groove

Get the funk out my face, get the funk out my face
Get the funk out my face, get the funk out my face
Get the funk out my face, get the funk out my face
