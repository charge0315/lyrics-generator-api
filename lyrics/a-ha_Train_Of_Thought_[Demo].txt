Hey!
Hey!
He likes to have the morning paper's crossword solved
Words go up, words come down
Forwards, backwards, twisted round
He doesn't act that strangely now there's people around
He's looking at their faces
They won't stick in his mind
Hoo-hoo-hoooo-hoo
He grabs a pile of letters from a small suitcase
Disappears into an office
It's another working day
And his thoughts are full of strangers
Corridors of naked lights
And his mind once full of reason
Now there's more than meets the eye
Now a stranger's face he carries with him
Ooooh
He likes a bit of reading on the subway home
Yeah
A distant radio's whistling tunes that nobody knows
He says "Hey... Won't you hurry? Hurry!"
A sudden interruption on his train of thought
This Monday is the Tuesday from the week before
He-he-he
Hoo-hoo-hoooo
Yeah
At home a house awaits him
He unlocks the door
Thinking "once there was a sea here
But there never was a door"
And his thoughts are full of strangers
And his eyes too numb to see
And nothing that he knows of
And nowhere where he's been
Was never quite like this
Yeah!
And at heart, he's full of strangers
Dodging on his train of thought
Train of thought
Train of thought
Train of thought
Train of thought
Train of thought
