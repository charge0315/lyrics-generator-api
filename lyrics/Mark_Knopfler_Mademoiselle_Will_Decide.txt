Wait a minute now
The girl is thinking
Well, well, will she wear that hat
Before she goes outside?
Will she do this or that
And be satisfied?
Who can tell?
Mademoiselle will decide
Come on down the midway
Baby, do you wanna ride?
Is it gonna be the roller coaster
Or the slippery slide?
Who can tell?
Mademoiselle will decide
Whatever you want, baby
Whatever you wanna do
Whatever you want, baby
You know daddy's right here for you
Wait a minute now
The girl is still thinking
She's got a divorce lawyer
Once she was a beautiful bride
She's got the house and the money
Will she want what she can't divide?
Who can tell?
Mademoiselle will decide
Well, well, Mademoiselle
Well, well, Mademoiselle
Well, well, Mademoiselle
Well, well, Mademoiselle
Who can tell?
Mademoiselle will decide
Well, well, Mademoiselle
Well, well, Mademoiselle
Well, well, Mademoiselle
Well, well, Mademoiselle
Who can tell?
Mademoiselle will decide
Who can tell?
Mademoiselle will decide
