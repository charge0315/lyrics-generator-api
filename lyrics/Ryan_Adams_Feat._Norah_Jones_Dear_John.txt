I got a house full of walls and utility bills
Every Monday the company calls
I got a nice bed to sleep on and a chest of drawers
Where I keep those dreams of yours

'Cause you're always mine
To keep when you're gone
Two silver rings, one's on my finger and the other one's gone
It went underground with you, oh John

Ten years passed
And I ended up with a house full of cats
But most of them went missing
From the window you never fixed, the door you never latched
When you were on your way out the last time

'Cause you're always mine
To keep when you're gone
Two silver rings
One's on my finger and the other one's gone
It went underground with you, oh John

I knew what you were doing that summer when Candy came around
But I had too much hurt to bother you
When we lost our first child, a little payment was overdue
And I wanted you so bad

'Cause you're always mine
To keep when you're gone
Two silver rings
One's on my finger and the other one's gone
It went underground with you, oh John

Oh John
Oh John
Oh John
I miss you
I miss you
Oh John
