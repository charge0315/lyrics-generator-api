Gotta be right, gotta hold ya tight, my baby
'Cause you're my lady, you're the one (you're the one)
Love just don't happen overnight, my honey
Let's take our time, baby
And make it right (make it right)
'Cause I want to love you (keep it real)
And I want to trust you (can you, girl)
'Cause I really need you (got to be real)
Can you keep it real with me?
'Cause I want to love you (keep it real)
And I want to trust you (can you, girl)
'Cause I really, really need you (got to be real)
Can you keep it real with me?
My heart's been going all around in circles
Looking for you, baby, you're the one
Might take more than just a day or two
To make sure our love is true
Ow, this is what we're gonna do
'Cause I want to love you (keep it real)
And I want to trust you (can you, girl)
'Cause I really need you (got to be real)
Can you keep it real with me?
Make sure that love is true (keep it real)
Invest some time in you (can you, girl)
'Cause our love is coming through (got to be real)
Can you keep it real with me?
Gone tomorrow, here today
These are all the games we play
Baby, keep it real
Can you keep it real?
'Cause I want to love you (keep it real)
And I want to trust you (can you, girl)
'Cause I really need you (got to be real)
Can you keep it real with me?
Make sure that love is true (keep it real)
Invest some time in you (can you, girl)
'Cause our love is coming through (got to be real)
Can you keep it real with me?
