Variety is the spice of life
So, why can't I be the one you call
When you need a change in love
I'll be the one that you need
When you need some kissin' and huggin'
Change from the same ol' lovin'
I'll be there to take his place
Just call on me
For what you need
CHORUS:
Oh
Let me (let me)
Let me be the one you need
(Let me be the one)
Let me (let me)
Let me be the one you need
(You need)
You need
Reality is so hard to find
Let me make all of your dreams come true
If you give my love a try
You'll see that I live for you
If your woman's intuition
Says there's something you've been missin'
Then, a chance on romance might be what you need
Just call on me
CHORUS
If your woman's intuition
Says there's something you've been missin'
Then, a chance on romance might be what you need
Just call on me
CHORUS (3X)
Instrumental break
