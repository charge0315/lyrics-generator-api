I am that, thou art that, and all this is that
I am that, thou art that, and all this is that
I am that, thou art that, and all this is that
This is that
Ooh

Daybreak and I take a glide
Into the pool of peace inside
Two ways and I both travel by
Life supporting waves of bliss
Mother Divine's precious kiss
Brings with love the light of wisdom
And the gift of eternal freedom
Two ways and I both travel by
And that makes all the difference to me

I am that, thou art that, and all this is that
I am that, thou art that, and all this is that
This is that
Ooh

Dusk time the shadows fall
Into the timeless time of all
Two ways and I both travel by
Golden auras glow around you
Omnipresent love surrounds you
Wisdom warming as the sun
You and I are truly one
Two ways and I both travel by
And that makes all the difference to me

Jai guru dev
I am that, thou art that, and all this is that
I am that, thou art that, and all this is that
I am that, thou art that, and all this is that
I am that, thou art that, and all this is that
I am that, thou art that, and all this is that
I am that, thou art that, and all this is that
I am that, thou art that, and all this is that
I am that, thou art that, and all this is that
