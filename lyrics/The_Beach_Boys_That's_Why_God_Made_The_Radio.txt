Tuning in the latest star
From the dashboard of my car
Cruisin' at seven
Push button heaven
Capturing memories from afar
In my car

That's why God made the radio (That's why God made)
(That's why God made)
So tune right in everywhere you go
He waved his hand, gave us rock 'n' roll
The soundtrack of falling in love
Falling in love, oh, falling in
That's why God made the radio

Feel the music in the air
Find a song to take us there
It's paradise when I
Lift up my antenna
Receiving your signal like a prayer
Like a prayer

That's why God made the radio (That's why God made)
(That's why God made)
So tune right in everywhere you go
He waved his hand, gave us rock 'n' roll
The soundtrack of falling in love
Falling in love, oh, falling in
That's why God made the radio

Making this night a celebration (Celebration)
Spreading the love and sunshine
To a whole new generation
Whole new generation

That's why God made
That's why God made
That's why God made the radio
That's why God made (That's why God made the radio)
That's why God made
That's why God made the radio
(Of falling in love)
That's why God made (God made)
That's why God made (God made)
That's why God made the radio
(Well, just like this)
That's why God made (God made)
That's why God made (God made)
That's why God made the radio
(Of falling in love)
That's...
