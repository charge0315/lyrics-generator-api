I'm in the mood for love simply because you're near me
Funny but when you're near me, I'm in the mood for love
Heaven is in your eyes, bright as the stars we're under
Or is it any wonder, I'm in the mood for love
Why stop to think of whether this little dream might fade
We'll put our hearts together - now we are one, I'm not afraid
If there's a cloud above, if it should rain, we'll let it
But for tonight forget it, I'm in the mood for love
