In our minds, there's hope and dreams of tomorrow
And in time, we'll find the key to our sorrow
With lots of love forever
Take the time to show your love for the symphony
Don't forget to thank the Lord for being here
Learn the things, sing like you know what's good for you
God is everywhere and he is watching you
In the stars, there are the answers we seek
And our hearts will beat the rhythms we need
To find ourselves again
Take the time to show your love for someone near
Don't forget to thank the Lord for being here
Learn the things, sing like you know what's good for you
God is everywhere and he is watching you
Someday when we assume
And God thinks we're ready, we'll know the truth
We will know the truth
We are all what we think, a bad song, things to be commands
To be commands
We'll, we'll
Take the time to show your love for someone near
Don't forget to thank the Lord for being here
Learn the things, sing like you know what's good for you
God is everywhere and he is watching you
Take the time to show your love for someone near
Don't forget to thank the Lord for being here
Learn the things, sing like you know what's good for you
God is everywhere and he is watching you
Take the time to show your love for someone near
Don't forget to thank the Lord for being here
Learn the things, sing like you know what's good for you
God is everywhere and he is watching you
Take the time to show your love for someone near
Don't forget to thank the Lord for being here
Learn the things, sing like you know what's good for you
God is everywhere and he is watching you
