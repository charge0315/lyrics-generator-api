I've traveled far
Over the oceans
Seen other worlds
Only one girl has my devotion

China, my love
I dream about you
And I guess I've learned
There's no return to life without you

Open your heart
I know that you can
You'll never find love till you do
China, it's true

China, I know
You've been conditioned
But on this night
Maybe you might forget your traditions

There must be love
Somewhere inside you
And you must confess
Your happiness has been denied you

Ten thousand miles
Can't keep us apart
I swear I will come back to you
China, I do

China, your eyes
Say you're believing
All I want to do
Is make love to you and not be dreaming

Open your heart
I know that you can
You'll never find love till you do
China, it's true
