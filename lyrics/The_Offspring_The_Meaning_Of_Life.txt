On the way, tryna get where I'd like to stay
I'm always feelin' steered away
By someone tryin' to tell me
What to say and do
I don't want it, I gotta go find my own way
Gotta go make my own mistakes
Sorry man for feelin'
Feelin' the way I do

Oh yeah, oh yeah
Open wide and they'll shove in their meaning of life
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Not for me, I'll do it on my own
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Open wide and swallow their meaning of life

Can't make it work your way
Thanks but no thanks!

Whoa-oh-oh

By the way, I know your path has been tried and so
It may seem like the way to go
Me, I'd rather be found
Tryin' something new
And the bottom line in all of this seems to say
There's no right and wrong way
Sorry if I don't feel like
Livin' the way you do

Oh yeah, oh yeah
Open wide and they'll shove in their meaning of life
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Not for me, I'll do it on my own
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Open wide and swallow their meaning of life

Can't make it work your way
Thanks but no thanks

Oh yeah, oh yeah
Open wide and they'll shove in their meaning of life
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Not for me, I'll do it on my own
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Open wide and swallow their meaning of life

Can't make it work your way
Thanks but no thanks

Whoa-oh-oh
