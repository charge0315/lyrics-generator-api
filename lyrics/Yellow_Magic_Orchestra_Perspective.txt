Everyday, I open the window
Everyday, I brush my teeth
Everyday, I read the paper
Everyday, I see your face

In the gleam of a brilliant twilight
I see people torn apart
From each other
Maybe that's their way of life

Everyday, I ride in cars
Everyday, I watch TV
Everyday, I write my diary
Everyday, I go to sleep

In the gleam of a brilliant twilight
I see people torn apart
From each other
Maybe that's their way of life

Everyday, I open the window
Everyday, I brush my teeth
Everyday, I read the paper
Everyday, I see your face
Everyday, I ride in cars
Everyday, I watch TV
Everyday, I write my diary
Everyday, I go to sleep
