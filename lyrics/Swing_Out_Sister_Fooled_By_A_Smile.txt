Words once said with tenderness
Have become meaningless
Broken promises take their toll
Now you're playing the fool

Torn between torment and bliss
Beckoned by temptation's kiss
Leave your ambitions standing still
All your dreams left unfulfilled
Make up your mind while there's still time to turn around

Fooled by a smile
You'll regret, won't forget what you've left behind
Fooled by a smile
You'll regret, won't forget what you've left behind

Lies that leave you cold inside
With a pain too hard to hide
Broken promises take their toll
Now you're playing the fool

Hide your face to save your shame
No one but yourself to blame
Leave your ambitions standing still
All your dreams left unfulfilled
Make up your mind while there's still time to turn around

Fooled by a smile
You'll regret, won't forget what you've left behind
Fooled by a smile
You'll regret, won't forget what you've left behind
Fooled by a smile
You'll regret, won't forget what you've left behind
Fooled by a smile
You'll regret, won't forget what you've left behind
Fooled by a smile

Fooled by a smile
You regret, won't forget what you've left behind
Fooled by a smile
You regret, won't forget what you've left behind
Fooled by a smile
You regret, won't forget what you've left behind
Fooled by a smile
You regret, won't forget what you've left behind
