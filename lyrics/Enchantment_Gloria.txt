Gloria
My Gloria
Things ain't been the same
Since you went away, yeah
Gloria (Gloria)
My Gloria (Ooh, Gloria), yeah
I don't wanna see another day

Seems like only yesterday
I beheld your sweet face
And in my lonely room
My memories (Memories) of your embrace, oh

Gloria (Gloria)
My Gloria, yeah
Things ain't been the same since you went away, yeah
Gloria (Gloria)
My Gloria (Ooh, Gloria), yeah
I don't wanna see another day (Ah)

Isn't it funny how time can change
All the things you want to believe
But time won't change the way I feel
'Cause in my mind (In my mind), it's you and me
(You and me) You and me, ah

Gloria (Gloria)
My Gloria, yeah
Things ain't been the same since you went away
I just can't go on
Gloria (Gloria)
My baby (Ooh, Gloria)
I don't wanna see another day (Ah)
So lonely, girl

Isn't it funny how time can change
All the things you want to believe
Oh, but time won't change the way I feel
'Cause in my mind (In my mind), it's still you and me
(You and me) You and me

Gloria (Gloria)
My Gloria, yeah
Things ain't been the same since you went away
I just can't go on
Gloria (Gloria)
My Gloria (Ooh, Gloria), yeah
I don't wanna see another day (Ah)

I don't wanna see, no, another day (Ah)
Without your love, I don't wanna see, oh, another day (Ah)
It's a real sad thing
But I don't wanna see, no, another day (Ah)
Without your love, I don't wanna see, no, another day (Ah)
It's gonna hurt me
But I don't wanna see, no, ooh (Ah), another day
I can't face the world no longer (Don't wanna see), no (Ah)
I just can't bear to be without your love (Don't wanna see), no (Ah)
Can't you hear me talking
