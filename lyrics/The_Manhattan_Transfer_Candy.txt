Candy
I call my sugar Candy
Because I'm sweet on Candy
And Candy's sweet on me
She understands me
My understanding Candy
And Candy's always handy
When I need sympathy
You wish that there were four of her
So I could love much more of her
She has taken your complete heart
Got a sweet tooth for my sweetheart
Candy
It's gonna be just dandy
The day I take my Candy
And make her mine, all mine
Candy
I call my sugar Candy
Because I'm sweet, so sweet on Candy
And Candy's sweet on me
You wish that there were four of him
Oh how I could love much more of him
He has taken your complete heart
You got a sweet tooth for your sweetheart
Candy
It's gonna be just dandy
The day I take my candy
Gee how the sun will shine
On the day my Candy
On the day my Candy
On the day my Candy's mine
