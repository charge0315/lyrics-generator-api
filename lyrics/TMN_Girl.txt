Ok excuse little mama, I'm not trying to waste yo time
But I saw your ass on campus, and ooh, you mighty fine
See, I heard you kinda goofy, and you like to laugh
Maybe we can have a little date right down the cafe
See, I don't care about yo nigga, he some cheese, call him "Cheddar"
He ain't treat you right, but Leek Jack will treat you better
I'm not tryna be yo friend, I'm not tryna be yo buddy
I'm tryna be yo man, and together we can study
I can bring in my dorm if you not real busy
And maybe we lay up while we watch a little tv
Baby tell how you feel, tell me what you gotta say
Let me rub on them feet while you tell me about yo day
I could see it in your face, I know you want some love
It's getting cold outside baby, do you want some hugs?
I'm just being real and, no, I'm not tripping
You make me wanna pay all the rest of your tuition

Girl, stop playin with me, I'ma make you my wifey
I don't care about your man
He don't really matter, he just temporary
Girl, stop playin with me, I'ma make you my wifey
I don't care about your man
He don't really matter, he just temporary

See, I'm really not the type to express just how I feel
But some reason, you are different, so I got to keep it real
See, you need a real nigga, something sweet, somebody loyal
Maybe we could fall in love and I can treat you like you spoil
I don't care about your past, this the present, let it go
There is a lot of things about you I'm still tryna get to know
I don't want to just hit, 'cause I want this shit to last
But let me fall back, I think I moving kinda fast
I can bring you to my crib baby if you act real calm
'Cause I ain't never let a female come and meet my mom
Baby, tell me how that sound, nod your head if that's OK
Now you understand I'm serious and I don't like to play
Tell me what you want to eat, I'll feed you nice and well
I know you want them panties 'cause they always got that sale
I'm just tryna love you, I'm done with all this talking
I knew I wanted you when I first saw you walking

Girl, stop playin with me, I'ma make you my wifey
I don't care about your man
He don't really matter, he just temporary
Girl, stop playin with me, I'ma make you my wifey
I don't care about your man
He don't really matter, he just temporary

You are something special, don't pretend you're not that (not that)
Something like a needle in a haystack
I hope you understand, did you hear what I said?
Write it down, let it go to your head
Like, and did you hear what I said?
Write it down, and let it go to your head
Stop, stop playing with me, he is just temporary
Stop playing with me, cuz Imma make you my wifey
Stop playing with me, yeah oh ohhhh
Playing with me, stop, stop playing with me
Imma make you my wifey
