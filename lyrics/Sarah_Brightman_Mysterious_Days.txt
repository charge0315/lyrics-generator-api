Springtime in Tangier
The sky's getting wider
Renewing its splendour
The world's getting brighter
Setting out just like the sun
That's never seen the rain
Stepping out, we're homeward bound
And never be the same

Ah, we lay our hearts wide open
Ah, we live mysterious days

American writers
Now work in the attic
Up in the Casbah
There's plenty to worship
Shine again, Arabian moon
And be the guiding light
Life is changing like the dunes
Wandering in the night

Ah, we lay our hearts wide open
Ah, we live mysterious days

We live mysterious days

Ah, we lay our hearts wide open
Ah, we live mysterious days
Ah, the spell cannot be broken
Ah, we live mysterious days

Ah-ya-ya, ah-ya-ya, ah-ya (We live mysterious days)
Ah-ya-ya, ah-ya-ya, ah-ya (We live mysterious days)
Oh (We live mysterious days)
Oh, oh (We live mysterious days)
