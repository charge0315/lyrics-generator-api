He's got a smile and it seems to me
Reminds me of childhood memories
Where everything was as fresh as a bright blue sky
And now and then when I see his face
It takes me away to that special place
And if I stared too long, I'd probably break down and cry

Oh, ooh-oh, sweet child o' mine
Ooh, oh-oh-oh, sweet love of mine

He's got eyes of the bluest skies
As if they thought of rain
I'd hate to look into those eyes
And see an ounce of pain
His hair reminds me of a warm safe place
Where as a child, I'd hide
And pray for the thunder and the rain
To quietly pass me by

Oh, ooh-oh, sweet child o' mine
Ooh, oh-oh-oh, sweet love of mine
Oh, oh-oh-oh, sweet child o' mine, oh, hey, hey
Oh, oh, sweet love of mine

Where do we go? Where do we go now?
Where do we go?
Where do we go? Where do we go now?
Where do we go?

Where do we go, sweet child?
Where do we go now?
Ah, where do we go?
Where do we go, sweet child?
Where do we go now?
Where do we go?
Where do we go now?
Where do we go?
Where do we go now
Now, now, now, now, now, now, now?
Sweet child, sweet child o' mine
