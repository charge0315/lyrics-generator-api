A faded photograph I mailed to you
With feelings I don't want to face
And a love song of surrender in blue
I remember when you took my breath away

Chanson papillon, we were very young
Like butterflies, like hot butterfly
Chanson papillon, we had just begun
We let it slide on by, we didn't realize

All our memories are burning in time
Like a bittersweet perfume
Can you tell me how a love that's so fine
Could have climaxed in a single afternoon?

Chanson papillon, we were very young
Like butterflies, like hot butterflies
Chanson papillon, we had just begun
We let it slide on by, didn't realize

Chanson papillon, chanson papillon
Ooh, ooh

Gone are the days of instant romance
And the nights of slow goodbyes
That was a time of life when foxy was the dance
And then you got wise to all my lies

Chanson papillon, we were very young
Like butterflies, like hot butterflies
Chanson papillon, we had just begun
We let it slide on by
Chanson papillon, we were very young
Like butterflies, like hot butterflies
Chanson papillon, we had just begun
Just begun to fly

Oh, yeah
I wanna say
Chanson papillon, chanson
I just want to remind you
Chanson papillon, chanson
Oh, do you remember?
Chanson papillon, chanson
Do you remember?
Chanson papillon, chanson
Chanson papillon, chanson
