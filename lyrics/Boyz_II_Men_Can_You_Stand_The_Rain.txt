On a perfect day
I know that I can count on you, ooh
When that's not possible
Tell me, can you weather the storm?

'Cause I need somebody who will stand by me (Yeah, yeah)
Through the good times and bad times
She will always, always be right there, yeah

Sunny days, everybody loves them
Tell me, can you stand the rain? (No)
Storms will come, this we know for sure (This we know for sure)
Can you stand the rain?

Your love unconditional
I'm not asking this of you, ooh
And girl, to make it last
I'll do whatever needs to be done

'Cause I need somebody (Yeah, yeah)
Who will stand by me (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
When it's tough she won't run
She will always be right there for me

Sunny days, everybody loves them
Tell me, can you stand the rain? (Can you stand it? Woah, woah)
Storms will come (I know, I know), this we know for sure (All the days won't be perfect, but tell me, can you stand it?)
Can you stand the rain? (Can you stand the rain?)

Can you stand the rain? (Can you stand the rain? No pressure, no pressure from me, baby)
Can you stand the rain?
Can you stand the rain? ('Cause I want you and I need you and I love you, yeah, tell me, yeah)
Can you stand the rain? (Will you be there for me?)
C'mon, baby, let's go get wet (Woah)
Can you stand the rain? (Can you stand the rain? This we know for sure)
Can you stand the rain? (Can you stand the rain? This we know for sure)
Can you stand the rain? (Storms will come, this we know for sure)
Can you stand the rain?
Can you stand the rain? (Yeah, it's kinda cold but I know, I know I'll be right there, yeah)
Can you stand the rain? (Yeah, oh)
