Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Oh oh oh
Hahaha!

Whatever happened to the Teenage Dream?

Surprise, surprise, the boys are home
My guardian angel's rung down my telephone
The heat's on mister, can't you hear them scream?

Whatever happened to the Teenage Dream?

The curfew comes at the, crack of night
The sad old wino aches to dissipate the fright
The jet junk jiver speeds past in his machine

But, whatever happened to the Teenage Dream?

A broken god, from a musty world
Sweetly mouthed touched, an onyx girl
His prison bars were very hard to clean, but

Whatever happened to the Teenage Dream?
Oh... Yeah!

Do it, do it, do it to me babe
Do it to me babe, ahhh

Whatever happened to the Teenage Dream?

The Wizard of Oz, and the bronzen thief
Ruled my girl with teutonic teeth
But all was lost, when her mouth turned green

Whatever happened to the Teenage Dream?
Yeah

Silver Surfer, and the Ragged Kid
Are all sad and rusted boy, they don't have a gig
Believe me Pope Paul, my toes are clean

Whatever happened to the Teenage Dream?
Yeah

Now black is black, and white is white
Some go to heaven and some get it light
Nobody disapproves but his wicked screams

Whatever happened to the Teenage Dream?
Yeah

Ohhh Hmm
Yeah
Ha haha
Okay, yeah let us try that
I'm talking teenage to you woman, yeah

Oh!
