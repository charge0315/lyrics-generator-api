There you were, beautiful
The promise of love was written on your face
You led me on with untrue kisses
Oh you held me captive in your false embrace

Quicker than I could bat an eye (I could bat an eye)
Seems you were telling me goodbye (Telling me goodbye)
Oh-oh, just a minute ago your love was here
All of a sudden it seemed to disappear
Sweetness was only heartache's camouflage
The love I saw in you was just a mirage

We used to meet in romantic places
Oh, you gave the illusion that your love was real
Now all that's left are lipstick traces
From the kisses you only pretended to feel

And now our meetings you avoid (Meetings you avoid)
And so my world you have destroyed (World you have destroyed)
Oh-oh, just a minute ago your love (Was here)
Oh but baby, all of a sudden it seemed to (Disappear)
Yeah, the way you wrecked my life was like sabotage
The love I saw in you was just a mirage

Oh, yeah

You only filled me with despair (Filled me with despair)
By showing love that wasn't there (Love that wasn't there)
Oh, just like the desert shows a thirsty man
A green oasis where there's only sand
You lured me into something I should have dodged
Oh, the love I saw in you was just a mirage
Ooh, yeah
Just like the desert shows a, yeah (Shows a thirsty man)
A green oasis where there's only, ooh (Where there's only sand)
Ooh ooh ooh you lured me into something I should have dodged
