I was a fool 'cause I fell for you
I should have known then
You were too good to be true
I went the distance but you faded away
Sometimes I feel like I'm all alone
Guess who's lookin' for love again?
(Guess who's lookin' for love?)
(Who's looking for love?)
Guess who's lookin' for love?
Cooling your heels at a local dive
You're a pistol
You make the place come alive
You'd like to linger
But you're too long away
Sometimes you feel like a souvenir
Guess who's lookin' for love again?
(Guess who's lookin' for love?)
(Who's looking for love?)
Guеss who's lookin' for love?
You said that you
(You said that you...)
Would never play that part
You had your own mind
(Hеy)
You'd never lead with your heart
You came together
(Came together)
But you went home alone
Sometimes you feel like you're overdue
Guess who's lookin' for love again?
(Guess who's lookin' for love?)
(Who's looking for love?)
Guess who's lookin' for love?
Guess who's lookin' for love again?
(Guess who's lookin' for love?)
(Who's looking for love?)
Guess who's lookin' for love again? Whoa
(Guess who's lookin' for love?)
(Who's looking for love?)
Guess who's lookin' for love?
