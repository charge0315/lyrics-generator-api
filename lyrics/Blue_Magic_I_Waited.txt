I can tell by your touch, that I'm not enough, or you want too much
Tell me truthfully (How, how)
Now the game is the same, never new to me, no variety
Like it used to be
Well, constantly on a stage, of a masquerade, of a moving page
In a storybook
Oh I never thought, that I could will to love another
It’s strange to me
And now you want me to stay
Just until my heart recovers from all the pain
Wanna tell you that I, I could've left anytime
But I waited
I, I could've loved anyone
But I waited
All my dreams would comе true
And I waited
I, I only knew mе and you
So I waited
And now I dry my eyes, and I wonder why
I’m blue, baby yeah
I'm blue, baby
Magic of the blue
I waited for you, ah oouh
Oh I never thought, that I could will to love another
It's strange to me
And now you want me to stay
Just until my heart recovers from all the pain
Wanna tell you that I, I could've left anytime
But I waited
I, I could've loved anyone
But I waited
All my dreams would come true
And I waited
But I, I only knew me and you
So I waited
Now I dry my eyes, and I wonder why
'Cause I, I could've left anytime, left anytime
But I waited
Oh I, I could've loved anyone
But I waited
And all my dreams would come true
And I waited
Oh I, I only knew me and you
And I waited
Hey I, I left anytime
But I waited
Oh I, I could’ve loved anyone
But I waited
Oh I, I only knew me and you
So I waited
And all my dreams would come true
And I waited
And I, I could’ve left anytime, I could've left anytime
But I waited
I, I could’ve loved anyone
But I waited
