Good bye, old friend
This is the end of the man(girl) I used to be
'cause there's been a strange and welcome change in me
For once in my life I have someone who needs me
Someone I've needed so long
For once, unafraid I can go where life leads me
And somehow I know I'll be strong
For once I can touch what my heart used to dream of long before I knew
Someone warm like you would make my dream come true
For once in my life I won't let sorrow hurt me
Not like it's hurt me before
For once I have something I know won't desert me
I'm not alone anymore
For once I can say this is mine, you can't take it
Long as I know I have love, I can make it
For once in my life I have someone who needs me
For once in my life I have someone who needs me
Someone I've needed so long
For once, unafraid I can go where life leads me
And somehow I know I'll be strong
For once I can touch what my heart used to dream of long before I knew
Someone warm like you would make my dream come true
For once in my life I won't let sorrow hurt me
Not like it's hurt me before
For once I have something I know won't desert me
I'm not alone anymore
For once I can say this is mine, you can't take it
Long as I know I have love, I can make it
For once I can feel that somebody's heard my plea
