Sometimes when life gets too tough
I guess I don't act too cool
I lose my head, and I mess things up, like a fool

But you, you never put me down
You understand and you care
Through thick and thin
Good and bad times, oh baby
You're always there

Jenny, Jenny
Jenny, I'm glad you're mine
Right or wrong, I'm a hero in your eyes
Jenny, Jenny
God was good to me
When He let you be my Jenny

When people asked about you
I have no words to describe
Just what you are
Except that you are my whole life

I know I'm such a lucky guy
Sometimes it's hard to believe
No matter how much I hurt you
You never stopped loving me

Jenny, Jenny
Jenny, I'm glad you're mine
Right or wrong, I'm a hero in your eyes
Jenny, Jenny
God was good to me
When He let you be my Jenny
Jenny
God was good to me...
