How can I know
We're 'bout our best
When more than dreams
Defer to confess
At our best there's worlds between
What would we do
And what we do to me and you
Walk in your shoes
Never mind much
Color of my skin won't tell of how I've been
Shouldn't we rather than
Supposin' 'bout my name
Supposin' 'bout my game
Suppose we're more the same
Suppose you like me
And rather than supposin' my guilt's to blame
Or that I'll never change
Suppose we share the pain
Suppose you like me
What would improve
The way we demonstrate "I do"
Commit such a love
Regarding none except you
Continue the bond
Let workin' peace calm all storms
Hold you like me
Never mind the
Amount account owed won't stop how far we'd go
If we would just rather than
Supposin' 'bout my name
Supposin' 'bout my game
Suppose we're more the same
Suppose you like me
Rather than supposin' my guilt's to blame
Or that I'll never change
Suppose we share the pain
Suppose you like me
