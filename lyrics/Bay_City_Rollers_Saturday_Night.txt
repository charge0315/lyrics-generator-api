Gonna keep on dancing to the rock and roll
On Saturday night, Saturday night
Dancin' to the rhythm in our heart and soul
On Saturday night, Saturday night
I-yi-yi-yi, I just can't wait
I-yi-yi, I gotta date

At the good ol' rock and roll
Folk show, I've gotta go!
Saturday night, Saturday night
Gonna rock it up, roll it up
Do it all, have a ball
Saturday night, Saturday night
It's just a Saturday night
It's just a Saturday night
It's just a Saturday night

Gonna dance with my baby
'Til the night is through
On Saturday night, Saturday night
Tell her all the little things I'm gonna do
On Saturday night, Saturday night
I-yi-yi-yi, I love her so
I-yi-yi, I'm gonna let her know

At the good ol' rock and roll
Folk show, I've gotta go!
Saturday night, Saturday night
Gonna rock it up, roll it up
Do it all, have a ball
Saturday night, Saturday night
It's just a Saturday night
It's just a Saturday night
It's just a Saturday night
