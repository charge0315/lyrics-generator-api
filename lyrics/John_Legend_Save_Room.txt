Say that you'll stay a little
Don't say bye-bye tonight
Say you'll be mine; just a little bit of love
Is worth a moment of your time
Knockin' on your door just a little
It's so cold outside tonight
Let's get a fire burnin', oh, I know
I'll keep it burnin' bright if you stay
Won't you save, save

Save room for my love
Save room for a moment to be with me
Save room for my love, save a little
Save a little for me, won't you save a little?
Save a little for me, oh

This just might hurt a little
Love hurts sometimes when you do it right
Don't be afraid of a little bit of pain
Pleasure is on the other side
Let down your guard just a little
I'll keep you safe in these arms of mine
Hold on to me, pretty baby
You will see, I can be all you need if you stay
Won't you save, save

Save room for my love
Save room for a moment to be with me
Save room for my love, save a little
Save a little for me, won't you save a little?
Save a little for me, oh

Oh, come on
Make time to live a little
Don't let this moment slip by tonight
You'll never know what you're missing till you try
I'll keep you satisfied, if you stay
Won't you save, save

Save room for my love
Save room for a moment to be with me
Save room for my love, save a little
Save a little for me, won't you save a little?
Save a little for me, oh
Save room for my love
Save room for a moment to be with me
Save room for my love, save a little
Save a little for me, won't you save a little?
Save a little for me, oh
