One day you'll find out that
Whatever and whenever will be
'Coz our life's are never meant to be
Happiness and
I can always take it but I miss you so much

Taken away from, taken away from my life
'Coz you were taken away from
Taken away from, taken away from my life
'Coz you were taken away from
Taken away from, taken away from my life
'Coz you were taken away from
Taken away from, taken away from my life
