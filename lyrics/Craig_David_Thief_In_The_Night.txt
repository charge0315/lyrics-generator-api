You were the one
Trusted me and you, we got something strong
But even I can tell, when somethings going on
You see my best friend and you ain't being straight
You two been hanging out while I been working late
And last night when we all went out to the club
Like it wasn't enough
You and him flirting and stuff, ohh
That's when he took you aside
His hand all up on your thighs
Baby, I see everything clearer now

When I was gonna trip the alarm
Girl, I can see through his charm
So I know when I'm out making dough
He be calling you on the low
Things you don't expect from a friend
And that's why I don't understand
'Cause you know what's up
But he let me down
Nigga steal the keys to my range
Credit cards and even my name
But when it comes to you, girl, it ain't the same
'Cause it causes way too much pain
Thought he could keep it all out of sight
He was like a thief in the night
'Cause you know what's up
But he let me down

I had enough and now you forced me
To get a few things off my mind
'Cause I can see right through your crying
Girl, you must think that I'm blind
And even though I don't want to
I just can't ignore the signs
And if you knew how much it hurts me
You wouldn't try to waste my time
Girl that's when you said (Because I love you)
I don't believe (There's no one but you)
'Cause I know you've used those words, girl
A million times before

When I was gonna trip the alarm
Girl, I can see through his charm
So I know when I'm out making dough
He be calling you on the low
Things you don't expect from a friend
And that's why I don't understand
'Cause you know what's up
But he let me down
Nigga steal the keys to my range
Credit cards and even my name
When it comes to you, girl, it ain't the same
'Cause it causes too much pain
Thought he could keep it all out of sight
He was like a thief in the night
'Cause you know what's up
But he let me down

Now I don't know what I'm gonna do, oh yeah
Never dealt with something quite like this before in my life, no no
It weren't suppose to be this way
You both disappointed me
Knew something was wrong
But it took me so long
To see, girl

When I was gonna trip the alarm
Girl, I can see through his charm
So I know when I'm out making dough
He be calling you on the low
Things you don't expect from a friend
And that's why I don't understand
'Cause you know what's up
But he let me down
Nigga steal the keys to my range
Credit cards and even my name
When it comes to you, girl, it ain't the same
'Cause it causes too much pain
Thought he could keep it all out of sight
He was like a thief in the night
'Cause you know what's up
But he let me down
When I was gonna trip the alarm
Girl, I can see through his charm
So I know when I'm out making dough
He be calling you on the low
Things you don't expect from a friend
And that's why I don't understand
'Cause you know what's up
But he let me down
Nigga steal the keys to my range
Credit cards and even my name
When it comes to you, girl, it ain't the same
'Cause it causes too much pain
Thought he could keep it all out of sight
He was like a thief in the night
'Cause you know what's up
But he let me down
