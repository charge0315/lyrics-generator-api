She must be all that he had
To  make him feel complete
What  more could a man ask for
A peace eternally
You've shown me worlds that I'm afraid of
But  all that I need
What  am I searching for when you're
In front of me
I  blame it on the rain that still cries
Sometimes your love's in the moonlight
Uninvisible queen
That one you'll find
In  the bed of your heart
He must be all she's ever wanted
To take that abuse
And still today she loves him
And he ditto too
You gave me children to care for
A reason to smile
So what am I crying for now
You're still in my life
I blame it on the times the sun don't shine
Sometimes your love's in the moonlight
Uninvisible queen
That one you'll find
In the bed of your heart

Don't wanna spend no idle time
I want my heart's shine
Sometimes your heart is in the moonlight
Uninvisible queen
That one you'll find
In the bed of your heart
Sometimes your love's in the moonlight
Uninvisible queen
That one you'll find
In the bed of your heart
