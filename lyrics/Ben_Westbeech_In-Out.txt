I breathe quickly
Every time you touch me
When the lights go out at night
I feel the joy inside me
Every time I push inside you
Don't say it, oh, squeeze tightly
Make it nicely, twice a nightly
Let's do it, coats around us
Put the Scheffers right inside
In and out, inside out
In and out, inside out, oh
In and out, inside out
In and out, inside out, oh
In and out, inside out
In and out, inside out, oh
In and out, inside out
In and out, inside out, oh
I move quicker
Every time you say to me
You want it faster
Then I love the way we end it
I know when I slip inside you
Let's slow down now, let's beat up
We know how to please each other
I want you moving more each day
Your my contagious lover
In and out, inside out
In and out, inside out, oh
In and out, inside out
In and out, inside out, oh
In and out, inside out
In and out, inside out, oh
In and out, inside out
In and out, inside out, oh
In and out, in and out
In and out, in and out, oh
In and out, in and out
In and out, in and out, oh
In and out, in and out
In and out, in and out, oh
In and out, in and out
In and out, in and out, oh
In and out, inside out
In and out, inside out, oh
In and out, inside out
In and out, inside out, oh
In and out, inside out
In and out, inside out, oh
In and out, inside out
In and out, inside out
