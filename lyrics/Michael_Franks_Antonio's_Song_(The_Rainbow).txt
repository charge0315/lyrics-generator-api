Antonio lives life's frevo
Antonio prays for truth
Antonio says our friendship is a hundred-proof
The vulture that circles Rio
Hangs in this L.A. sky
The blankets they give the Indians
Only make them die
But sing the song
Forgotten for so long
And let the music flow
Like light into the rainbow
We know the dance, we have
We still have the chance
To break these chains and flow
Like light into the rainbow
But sing the song
Forgotten for so long
And let the music flow
Like light into the rainbow
We know the dance, we have
We still have the chance
To break these chains and flow
Like light into the rainbow
Antonio loves the desert
Antonio prays for rain
Antonio knows that pleasure is the child of pain
And lost in La Califusa
When most of my hope was gone
Antonio's samba led me to the Amazon
We sing the song
Forgotten for so long
And let the music flow
Like light into the rainbow
We know the dance, we have
We still have the chance
To break these chains and flow
Like light into the rainbow
