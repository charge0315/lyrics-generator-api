Whenever dark has fallen
You know the spirit of the party starts to come alive
Until the day is dawning
You can throw out all your blues and hit the city lights

'Cause there's music in the air
And lots of lovin' everywhere
So gimme the night (In the evening)
(Alright, tonight)
Gimme the night (In the evening)
(Every night)

You need the evening action (Ba-dubadub-dubadub-dubadub)
A place to dine, a glass of wine, a little late romance
It's a chain reaction (Ba-dubadub-dubadub-dubadub)
You'll see the people of the world coming out to dance

'Cause there's music in the air
And lots of lovin' everywhere
So gimme the night (In the evening)
(Every night)
Gimme the night (In the evening)
(Alright, tonight)

So come on out tonight and we'll lead the others
On a ride through paradise
And if you feel all right
Then we can be lovers 'cause I see that starlight
Look in your eyes
Don't you know we can fly?

Just gimme the night (In the evening)
(Alright, tonight)
Gimme the night (In the evening)

Don't you know we can fly?

And if we stay together (Ba-dubadub-dubadub-dubadub)
We'll feel the rhythm of the evening taking us up high
Never mind the weather (Ba-dubadub-dubadub-dubadub)
We'll be dancing in the street until the morning light
