Please baby don't (Baby, don't)
Don't fall in love with me
Please baby don't (Baby, don't)
You know my history
See, honey I'm (Honey I'm)
I'm just trying to warn you (Let me warn you)
Please baby don't (Baby, don't)
Don't fall in love with me

We've been cruisin' down this road for a while now
I should tell the truth
Girl, you've been so good to me
But I know I'm no good for you
You should run while you can
Find yourself a better man
'Cause I'm known for brief romance
And breakin' hearts across the land

Yes, I've been known to have a few temptations
Out there on the road
And let's say hypothetically I slipped and took a couple home
Girl, I know that's not fair
You need someone who'll be there
So just get away before it's too late
And your pain's too much to bear

Please baby don't (Baby, don't)
Don't fall in love with me
Please baby don't (Baby, don't)
You know my history
See, honey I'm (Honey I'm)
I'm just trying to warn you (Let me warn you)
Please baby don't (Baby, don't)
Don't fall in love with me

And please baby don't (Baby, don't)
Don't fall in love with me
Please baby don't, oh (Baby, don't)
You know my history
See, honey I'm (Honey I'm)
I'm just trying to warn you (Let me warn you)
Please baby don't, oh (Baby, don't)
Don't fall in love with me

Now on second thought maybe we'll give
This love another try
'Cause I can't see you with no one else
I'm selfish, I can't lie
So let's go, let's go slow
You know all you need to know
It could end one day but
Let's just say we'll see how far it goes

Please baby don't, oh (Baby, don't)
Don't fall in love with me
Please baby don't (Baby, don't)
You know my history
See, honey I'm (Honey I'm)
I'm just trying to warn you (Let me warn you)
Please baby don't, oh (Baby, don't)
Don't fall in love with me
