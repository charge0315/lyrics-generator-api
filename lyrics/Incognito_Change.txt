(J.P. Maunick/R. Bull)
What we got here
Is not a fool's dream
We really feel the need
We've come to ground
Like prisoners on the run
Just minutes away from freedom
Ain't no use in fooling ourselves
We really feel the need
Whatever it takes
Nothing will be too much
We both long for better days
Baby, we're different as the seasons
Never ever giving reasons
Left with the tears
And the paralysing fear
That brings us to our knees
Chorus:
Change
Bring on the changes
Change
Bring on the changes
It's no pretending, no denying
When you really feel the neeed
Going to hang on and be strong
Turn the tables, make the change
The two of us, different as the seasons
Never ever giving reasons
Left with the tears
And the paralysing fear
That brings us to our knees
Chorus x 2
There's gotta be some give and take
If we ever gonna make a change
Chorus x 2
