There's something about you
Tears me inside out whenever you're around
There's something about you
Speeding through my veins and then we hit the ground
And there's something about this rush
Take it away
It made me feel so good
I got a feeling, you got a feeling, we get a feeling
Like we could die

Mother
We just can't get enough
We just can't get enough
Lover
We just gotta get it up
We just gotta get it up

There's something about you
That tears me inside out whenever you're around
There's something about you
That makes me fly
You're a heart attack, just the kind I like!
There's something about your kiss
Haunting and strange
That made me feel so good

I get a feeling, you get a feeling, we got a feeling
Like we're alive and

Mother
We just can't get enough
We just can't get enough (when you're around, baby)
Lover (yeah)
We just gotta get it up
We just gotta get it up

Ho
This world ain't got too much time
Though, baby, I'm fine because maybe you're mine, yeah
We just gotta get enough
You better give up
Come on and give up
Yeah, you better give up
Give up your life
Ow!

Do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do, yeah, yeah, yeah
It's you for me, and me for you
You make my dreams come true
Off the wall, I wanna say
I gotta be with you now, baby
You're on my mind all the time
We found a billion dimes
I rolled the dice, we lost them all
And, baby, I just don't mind, mind, mind, mind

Mother
We just can't get enough
We just can't get enough (when you're around, baby)
Lover (yeah)
We just gotta get it up
We just gotta get it up, huh

This world ain't got too much time
But, baby, I'm fine because maybe you're mine, yeah
We just gotta get it up
We just gotta get it up
'Cause Mother
