Cum on feel the noize
Cum on feel the noize
Cum on feel the noize
Cum on feel my love and destroy
I don't have a right
I don't even lie
I don't wanna cry
But everyday I sigh
I know the delight
The reason you deride
Never gonna cry
Until you gotta do
Remember
I don't have a right
I don't even lie
I don't wanna die
Sakes! Jesus Christ!
I know the delight
The reason you deride
I'll never gonna die
Until you gotta do
Remember
God, save the world!
Don't want to say good-bye
God, save the world
Don't know the way we should go
Cum on feel the noize
Cum on feel my love and destroy!
Cum on feel the noize
Cum on feel my love and destroy!
Now!
Right!
I don't have a right
I don't even lie
I don't wanna die
Sakes! Jesus Christ!
I know the delight
The reason you deride
I'll never gonna die
Until you gotta do
Remember
God, save the world!
Don't want to say good-bye
God, save the world
Don't know the way we should go
Cum on feel the noize
Cum on feel my love and destroy!
Cum on feel the noize
Cum on feel my love and destroy!
Cum on feel the noize
Cum on feel the noize
Cum on feel the noize
Cum on feel my love and destroy
Cum on feel the noize
Cum on feel my love and destroy!
Cum on feel the noize
Cum on feel my love and destroy!
Cum on feel the noize
Cum on feel the noize
Cum on feel the noize
Cum on feel the noize
Search and destroy!
