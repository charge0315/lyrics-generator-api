Would you believe - I was born in your tasty mind
Somewhere between blue meadows and lullabies
Somehow my style you create into wonderings
I'm here to stay, just as long as you're asleep
Don't fear me now - can't you see, I'm your greatest fan
I'm your misty mood, as splendid as in your soul
You dress me up, wash my hair, make up my features
I'm here to stay, just make sure you close your eyes
Now you're awake, I'm alone and I miss my friends
Let's go to bed, wish me the sandman, be sweet
Good morning sir, I was born in your fantasy
Somewhere between forever changes and haze
You built my home, resting place, and I love you, so
I'm here to stay as long as you don't wake up
