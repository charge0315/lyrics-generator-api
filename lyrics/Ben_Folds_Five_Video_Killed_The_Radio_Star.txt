I heard you on my wireless back in fifty two
Lying awake intently tuning in on you
If I were young it didn't stop you coming through
Oh-a oh
They took the credit for your second symphony
Rewritten by machine all new technology
And now I understand the problems you can see
Oh-a oh
I met your children
Oh-a oh
What did you tell them?
Video killed the radio star
Video killed the radio star
Pictures came and broke your heart
Oh-a-oh oh oh
And now we meet in an abandoned studio
We hear the playback and it seems so long ago
And you remember the jingles used to go
Oh-a oh
You were the first one
Oh-a oh
You were the last one
Video killed the radio star
Video killed the radio star
In my mind and in my car
We can't rewind, we've gone to far
Oh-a-oh oh oh
Oh-a-oh oh oh
Video killed the radio star
Video killed the radio star
In my mind and in my car
We can't rewind we've gone to far
Pictures came and broke your heart
Put all the blame on VTR
You are the radio star
You are the radio star
Video killed the radio star
Video killed the radio star
Video killed the radio star
Video killed the radio star
Video killed the radio star
Video killed the radio star
Video killed the radio star
Video killed the radio star
Video killed the radio star
Video killed the radio star
Video killed the radio star (Radio star)
Video killed the radio star
