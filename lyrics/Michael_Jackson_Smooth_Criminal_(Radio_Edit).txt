As he came into the window
Was a sound of a crescendo
He came into her apartment
He left the bloodstains on the carpet
She ran underneath the table
He could see she was unable
So she ran into the bedroom
She was struck down, it was her doom

Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay?
Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay?
Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay?
Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay?
Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay?
Will you tell us that you're okay
There's a sound at the window
Then he struck you a crescendo, Annie
He came into your apartment
Left the bloodstains on the carpet
And then you ran into the bedroom
You were struck down
It was your doom
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay?
Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay?
Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay?
Are you okay, Annie?
You've been hit by—
You've been hit by a smooth criminal
OW

So they came into the outway
It was Sunday, what a black day
Mouth-to-mouth resuscitation
Sounding heartbeats intimidations

Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay?
Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay?
Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay?
Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay?
Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay?
Will you tell us that you're okay
There's a sound at the window
Then he struck you a crescendo, Annie
He came into your apartment
Left the bloodstains on the carpet
And then you ran into the bedroom
You were struck down
It was your doom
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay?
Are you okay, Annie?
You've been hit by—
You've been struck by a smooth criminal
OW

(Annie, are you okay?)
I don't know
(Will you tell us, that you're okay)
I don't know
(There's a sound at the window)
I don't know
(That he struck you a crescendo, Annie)
I don't know
(He came into your apartment)
I don't know
(Left the bloodstains on the carpet)
I don't know
(And then you ran into the bedroom)
I don't know
(You were struck down, it was your doom, Annie)
Daggone it
(Annie, are you okay?)
Daggone it, Annie
(Will you tell us, that you're okay)
Daggone it, baby
(There's a sound at the window)
Daggone it, Annie
(That he struck you a crescendo, Annie)
Woo, woo
(He came into your apartment)
Daggone it
(Left the bloodstains on the carpet)
Woo, woo
(And then you ran into the bedroom)
Daggone it
(You were struck down, it was your doom)
OW...
