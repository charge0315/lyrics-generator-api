I can talk about it now, now that the storm has gone
I know the hurt lingers on, back then I couldn't stop, 'cos I did not know how
Maybe someday you'll look back with the understanding why we do the things we do
It's always easier to see when your soul has grown and time sets you free
Oh I wish that I could turn back the hands of time
Oh I wish that I could stop start over again
Oh I wish that I could turn back the hands of time
'Cos it's only now that I can understand
Where I went wrong
I was searching for myself, though I did not know it at the time
You had put your faith in me, but my feet were barely on the ground
Maybe someday we'll sit and talk
'Bout the things we did and what we didn't do
It will be easier to see
When your pain has flown and time sets you free
