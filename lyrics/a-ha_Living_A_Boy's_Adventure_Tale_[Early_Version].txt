I've fixed my dwelling for the night
Lights in pairs come passing by
Where I hide
My shadow is the only one
That leaves my loneliness alone
To lick my wounds

Night has found me
Just in time
To help me close my eyes, one more time

Living a boy's adventure tale
In so many ways
I'm living a boy's adventure tale
For so many days
I'm living a boy's adventure tale
Can't escape if I wanted to
Living a boy's adventure tale
I may be dreaming but I feel awake

I've been lost in so many places
Seeking love in so many faces
Change of weather
The rain pours down
My head in hands
Pressed to the ground

And where
Am I supposed to go now?

Living a boy's adventure tale
In so many ways
I'm living a boy's adventure tale
Living a boy's adventure tale
Closing my eyes, a voice I hear
Living a boy's adventure tale
Singing a lullaby for me

Living a boy's adventure tale
Because of you
I'm living a boy's adventure tale
Oh, you know it's true
I'm living a boy's adventure tale
In so many ways, aahhh, ahh
So many ways (living a boy's adventure tale)
So many days (living a boy's adventure tale)
(Living a boy's adventure tale)
