When you are down and feeling low
And you don't know which way to go
You just pick up your own telephone, girl
If you get in-touch with me
I'll be there instantly
It's a shame you can't belong to me, So
Whenever you're down (Look me up)
Whenever you're down (Look me up)
Because whenever you're down, just look around
Life's too short to live alone
If you were mine I would build you a home
It's so nice to have someone to lean on
When you need some company
All you have to do is call on me
In my arms you'll find security, so
Whenever you're down (Look me up)
Whenever you're down (Look me up)
Because whenever you're down, just look around
(Look me up baby) Whenever you're down
(Look me up girl) Whenever you're down
(Look me up baby) Whenever you're down
(Look me up girl) Because whenever you're down, just look around
(Music)
It's so nice to have someone to lean on
(Music)
You just pick up your own telephone, girl, so
Whenever you're down (Look me up)
Whenever you're down (Look me up)
Because whenever you're down, just look around
