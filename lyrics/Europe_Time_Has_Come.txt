Long for the sailor, beneath the skies
Long for the white dove, no matter where she fly
Long for the stranger you know so well, so well
Pray for the soldier, who's wounded bad
Pray for the dreamer, he's still so sad
Pray for the stranger you know so well
Because I'm coming home
Now the time has come (come)
Oh, yeah
Now the time has come (come)
Oh, my
Oh, oh, oh
For me to come back home
Long for the eagle, on wings so strong
Long for the hunter, he won't be long
Long for the stranger you know so well
Because I'm coming home
Now the time has come (come)
Oh, yeah
Now the time has come (come)
Oh, my
Oh, oh, oh
For me to come back home
Now the time has come (come)
Oh, yeah
Now the time has come (come)
Woah oh yeah, yeah!
Now the time has come (come)
I'm headed back home again
So baby now, the time has come
Oh, oh, my?
So baby now the time has come (come)
Oh, oh yeah!
