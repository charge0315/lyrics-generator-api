Stepped in the club alone at
Atlanta Live
Hat tilted to one side
I watch her body, in phase
Platinum eyes like in department stores
She's curious, of course
"You'll be mine one day," I said
If we could sometimes just go out
With margaritas, drink greyhounds
Don't quite like dancing (too cool)
But I could sense her class in a magazine
She looks just like Halle
I found it; I know I found love
Now I know love can be true
When I saw you in bird's eye view
Baby I found love (Girl you define love)
When all the bus drivers turn cool
With no more taxis cruisin' through
I'll still find you, love (Girl you define)
Now Girl these girls the kind that play around
Don't wanna make her frown
She'll bring her laundry to bed
And every day she finds a sunny cloud
It sort of makes me smile;
She's so dramatically free
I'd like to show you my new house
I've seen us makin' on my couch
You'd dig the bathtub, for sure
So I baptized her in the bubble bath
She came out screamin' mad
Oh, what a laugh
'Cause she still had Halle's eyes
Now I know love can be true
When I saw you in bird's eye view
Baby I found love (Girl you define love)
When all the bus drivers turn cool
With no more taxis cruisin' through
I'll still find you, love (Girl you define)
I'd take the A-Train to follow you
Oh she said
She thinks it's all good
Don't matter what your body do
Oh cool, I'm cool
She thinks I'm cool
Now I know love can be true
When I saw you in bird's eye view
Baby I found love (Girl you define love)
When all the bus drivers turn cool
With no more taxis cruisin' through
I'll still find you, love (Girl you define)
