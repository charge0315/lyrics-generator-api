Rain falling to the ground
Listening to its sound
Quenching the thirst in my heart
Revealing a whole new start
Deep as the ocean's depths
Was our love when we met
Just as a rain is falling
Could we together fulfill our calling
Although love I've yet to send
Is like a river that never ends
As a new days always appears
Our love will always be why we're here
Deep as the ocean's depths
Was our love when we we met
Just as the rain is falling
Could we together fulfill our calling
Rain falling to the ground
Listening to its sound
Quenching the thirst in my heart
Revealing a whole new start
Revealing a whole new start
I know our love will always be why we are here
