Yeah, yeah, yeah
She just don't mind
Aww, yeah (Check it)

I'm not usually the type to speak my mind
Might be rude of me, but you're so damn fine
What you do to me
Got me feeling kinda crazy (Baby, let's just do it right now)
Would it bother you if we go to my room?
There's a couple things that I gots to show you
'Cause I'm not tryna rush you, but there's one thing wrong
Right now, you've got too many clothes on, oh

Girl, them jeans that you're wearing (Just take 'em off)
And that shirt that you came in (Just take it off)
Don't be mad if I'm starin' (Just take it off, baby)
(Take 'em off, take 'em off)
Tear them sheets off the bed
'Cause we 'bout to go ahead (And take 'em off)
Girl, them heels look so right, so just leave 'em on
Ain't no clothes allowed here
So, baby girl, just take 'em off

Baby, just wait a minute
Let's just slow this down
We can relax, babe
And you can let your hair down (Let your hair down)
You ain't gotta worry
'Cause I ain't tryna hurry (Oh no)
I'ma take some time and get this right, baby

Lemme unplug the phone
So we can be all alone
Lemme turn down the lights
'Cause, baby, tonight it's on
I'ma put on some music
All of our favorite songs
Baby, c'mon, let's do this
And let's get it on

Girl, them jeans that you're wearing (Just take 'em off)
And that shirt that you came in (Just take it off)
Don't be mad if I'm starin' (Just take it off, baby)

Tear them sheets off the bed
'Cause we 'bout to go ahead ('Cause we 'bout to go ahead, and take 'em off)
Girl, them heels look so right, so just leave 'em on
Ain't no clothes allowed here
So, baby girl, just take 'em off, yeah

(Girl) Girl, I will do anything it takes to make it special
Maybe I can taste your love and I know you like me to (You like me to)
'Cause I never had a girl before I could trust like you
And I never had a love before who's down to get undressed like you (Girl, it's so hard)
And I can't resist the way you slide things over your hips (I can't stop)
Can't control myself, lay my hand over on your (Shh, girl)
You almost there now
That's your last pair now
So go and take 'em off, baby (Take 'em off, baby, oh, oh)

Girl, them jeans that you're wearing (Just take 'em off)
(Ooh) And that shirt that you came in (Just take it off)
Don't be mad if I'm starin' (Ooh, just take it off, baby)

Tear them sheets off the bed
'Cause we're 'bout to go ahead (Oh, and just go ahead, girl, and take 'em off)
Girl, them heels look so right, so just leave 'em on
Ain't no clothes allowed here (Oh yeah)
So, baby girl, just take 'em off (Yeah, just take 'em off)
