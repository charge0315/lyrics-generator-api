Oh, you've got a friend, baby
You've got a friend in me
When you're down and troubled
And you need some loving care
And nothing, no, is going right
Close your eyes and think of me
Oh and soon I will be there
To brighten up even your darkest nights, yeah
You just call out my name
And you know wherever I am
I'll come running, yeah
To see you again
Don't you know that
Winter, spring, summer or fall
All you got to do is call?
And I'll be there, yes, I will
You've got a friend
Ain't it good to know that you've got a friend
People can be so cold
They'll hurt you and desert you
Take your very soul if you let them
So don't let them, no
You just call out my name
And you know wherever I am
I'll come running, yeah
To see you again, yeah
Don't you know that
Winter spring summer or fall
All you've got to do is call?
And I'll be there, yes, I will
You've got a friend, yeah
You've got a friend
You've got a friend
You've got a friend in me
Call out my name, why don't you?
I'll be right there
You've got a friend in me
Whenever you need me
Call out name, why don't you?
Whenever you want me
I'll be there
Whenever you need me
I'll be right there
You've got a friend in me
You've got a friend in me
You've got a friend, baby
You've got a friend in me
When nothing is goin' right
 I'll be there
