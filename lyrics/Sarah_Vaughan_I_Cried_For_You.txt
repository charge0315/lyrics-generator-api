I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me
Every road has a turning
That's one thing you're learning
I cried for you; what a fool I used to be
Now I found two eyes just a little bit bluer
Found two arms a little bit truer
I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me
I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me
Every road has a turning
That's one thing you're learning
I cried for you; what a fool I used to be
I found two eyes just a little bit bluer
Found two arms a little bit truer
I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me
