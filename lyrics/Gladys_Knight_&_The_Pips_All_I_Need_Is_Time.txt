Time, time
All I need, all I need is time

All I need is time
Then I'll get over you
A little at a time (A little at a time)
A bit each day
(Just a little, just a little, just a little, just a little time)
All I need is time
To mend a dream or two
To live without the love
You took away

But morning's here again (Morning's here again)
And just like the day before (The day before)
But the only change (But the only change)
Is that I love you more (All, all, all, all)

But all I need is time
Maybe a thousand years
Maybe a million tears
But I need time
(All I need, all I need is time)

Everybody says, ah, the pain won't last too long
Just have a lot of fun and time will fly
It took a lot of time 'til love was born in me
I know, I know it's gonna take some time
For that love to die

Each and every day (Each and every day)
I spend forgetting you (Forgetting you)
Ah, brings another night (Brings another night)
I never quite get through (All, all, all, all)

But all I need is time
Maybe a thousand years
Maybe a million tears
But I need time

All I need is time
