I've heard people say that
Too much of anything is not good for you, baby (Oh, oh)
But I don't know about that
As many times as we've loved and
We've shared love and made love, it's (Well, well)
It doesn't seem to me like it's enough (Ah, yeah yeah)
It's just not enough of it
Uh, it's just not enough
Oh, oh, babe
Oh, babe

My darling, I can't get enough of your love, babe
Girl, I don't know, I don't know why, can't get enough of your love, babe

Oh, some things I can't get used to, no matter how I try
It's like the more you give, the more I want and, baby, that's no lie
Oh no, babe, tell me, what can I say? What am I gonna do?
How should I feel when everything is you?
What kind of love is this that you're givin' me?
Is it in your kiss or just because you're sweet?

Girl, all I know
Is every time you're here, I feel the change, huh
Somethin' moves, I scream your name
Look what you got me doin'

Darling, I, I can't get enough of your love, babe
Girl, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know why, I can't get enough of your love, babe
Oh, no, babe

Girl, if I could only make you see and make you understand
Girl, your love for me is all I need and more than I can stand
Oh, well, babe
How can I explain all the things I feel?
You've given me so much, girl, you're so unreal still
I keep loving you more and more each time
Girl, what am I gonna do? Because you're blowin' my mind

I get the same old feelin'
Every time you're here, I feel the change
Somethin' moves, I scream your name
Look what you got me doin'

Darling, I can't get enough of your love, babe
Oh no, babe

Baby, it didn't take all of my life to find you
But you can believe it's gonna take the rest of my life to keep you
Oh, oh, babe
Ah

My darling, I can't get enough of your love, babe
Girl, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know why, can't get enough of your love, babe
Oh, my darling, I can't get enough of your love, babe
Oh, babe, girl, I don't know, I don't know why, I can't get enough of your love, babe
Oh, darling, I can't get enough of your love, babe
