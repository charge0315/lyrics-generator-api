What goes around comes around
What goes around comes around

Baby I'm the guy that started out with you
I'm the guy who loved you long before he knew
Just a smile, your smile could turn a crowd on
Watching from the winds I saw you take the town
Saw you do your thing with almost any clown
Baby I'm the guy who love you so and you walked out on

What goes around comes around, baby
Someday, someone's gonna put you down
What goes around comes around, baby
Someday, when you're coming back to me
You'll see
Baby, I won't be around

Ain't you ridin' high, the world is at your feet
Like a bowl of honey life is sugar sweet
But someday, someday, you'll end up hurtin'
Breaking hearts and telling lies to reach the top
Guess you think the  applause will never stop
Guess you think that no one's ever gonna pull the curtain

What goes around comes around, baby
Someday someone's gonna put you down
What goes around comes around, baby
Someday when you're coming back to me
You'll see
Baby, I won't be around
What goes around comes around
What goes around comes around
Baby, what goes around comes around
Baby, what goes around comes around...
