May I, baby, hmm walk you a-home, yeah
May I, baby, because I don't want you to be all alone, no no
Now listen will you?
With each step, my heart beat three times
Because there's so much trouble in my little mind

May I, baby, come and tell you what it's all about?
May I, baby, I hope you are anxious to find out, listen
I'm just a little boy, live behind a grocery store
I've been watchin' you come and go now
May I, baby? Can I, honey, tell you how I feel?

I love the ground you walk on, yes I do, now
Oh I pick you and nobody else
You bright mama, can you listen to what I'm saying
(Why) She's been through the same thing herself

May I, baby, give my little heart to you?
May I, baby, you can do anything you want to do
Tell me baby, may I, baby?
May I, baby, may I, baby
And all you got to do is put your hand in my hand, baby
Now, save me yeah, yeah
