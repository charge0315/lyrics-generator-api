We stay away all in time
When your Caroline bids you
To save her and her kind
Will mean anything
We like your Caroline
Didn't you hear this tale, true then
And longer than my bed
Never to cover your sins
Come back and smash a crown
Too heavy for your head, anyway
And to where you can
Remember hunger again
Free them and say their names
As loud as they will let you think
The songs you hear
But can't sing out today
Don't you cry
Go lie down in the day
Freedom has come to burn
You've come to say my name
How'd it save her?
I'm frightened and I'm right
Your candles are burning again
