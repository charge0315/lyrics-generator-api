I've got your number
Don’t you know it's true?
I've got your number
I’m a-callin', callin' out to you
When I'm feeling lonesome
You know just what to do
I've got your number
I'm a-callin', callin' out to you
Down on the faultline
It could go either way
To be delivered or forsaken
You know, it’s not for me to say
Up on the bandstand
The rhythm of the street
You’re feelin' good now
Full of know-how
Yes, it almost seems complete
’Til win or show, you can't let go
And struggle as you may
You can't walk away
I've got your number
I’ve got your number
Don't you know it's true?
I've got your number
I'm a-callin', callin' out to you
When you're on the dark side
I know just what to do
I've got your number
I'm a-callin', callin' out to you
Hear me call
(Callin' out to you, callin' out to you)
(Callin' out to you)
(Callin' out to you, callin' out to you)
(Callin' out to you)
Oh, whoa
(Callin' out to you, callin' out to you)
(Callin' out to you)
(Callin' out to you, callin' out to you)
(Callin' out to you)
