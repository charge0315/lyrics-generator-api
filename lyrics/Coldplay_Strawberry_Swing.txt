Two, three, four
That's a bit fast
One, two, three

They were sittin', they were sittin'
On the strawberry swing
Every moment was so precious
They were sittin', they were talkin'
On the strawberry swing
Everybody was for fightin'
Wouldn't wanna waste a thing

Cold, cold water, bring me 'round
Now my feet won't touch the ground
Cold, cold water, what you say?
When it's such, it's such a perfect day
It's such a perfect day

I remember, we were walkin'
Up to strawberry swing
I can't wait till the mornin'
Wouldn't wanna change a thing

People movin' all the time
Inside a perfectly straight line
Don't you wanna just curve away?
When it's such, it's such a perfect day
It's such a perfect day

Ah-ah, ah-ah-ah
Now the sky could be blue, I don't mind
Without you, it's a waste of time
Could be blue, I don't mind
Without you, it's a waste of time
Well, the sky could be blue, could be grey
Without you, I'm just miles away
Well, the sky could be blue, I don't mind
Without you, it's a waste of time
