You don't know what we're talkin' about when we say there's...
There's too many starvin' children
And you don't know what we're talkin' about when we say we're...
Killing each other
And we just ain't got time for ya brother, no, no – hey, hey!
You don't know what we're talkin' about, when we say
We're livin' in the last days and time, no, no, no
You don't know – no, no, no, no, no
