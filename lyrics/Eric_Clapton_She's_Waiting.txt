She is waiting for another love
She is waiting for another love

She has been waiting for another love
Someone that she can show into her heart
And when she finally finds a stronger love
Your whole world is going to fall apart

You've been abusing her for far too long
Think you're a king, she's your pawn
Get ready now, 'cause pretty soon
She will be gone and you will be on your own

I see the hunger burning in her eye
Any fool could see there is something wrong
You keep pretending not to care
But I will hear you sing a different song

Waiting for another lover
Hoping for the time that she will find another
