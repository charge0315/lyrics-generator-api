The very thought of you
And I forget to do
Those little ordinary things
That everyone ought to do
I'm living in a kind of a daydream
But I'm happy as a queen
And foolish though it may seem
To me, that's everything

The mere idea of you
The longing here for you
You'll never know
How slow the moments go
When I'm near to you
I see your face in every flower
Your eyes in stars above
It's just the thought of you
The very thought of you, my love
My love, my love

My love
