Gonna build a mountain from a little hill
Gonna build a mountain least I hope I will
Gonna build a mountain gonna build it high
I don't know how I'm gonna do it
I only know I'm gonna try
Gonna build a daydream from a little hope
Gonna push that daydream up the mountain slope
Gonna build a daydream gonna see it through
Gonna build a mountain and a daydream
Gonna make 'em both come true
Gonna build a heaven from a little hell
Gonna build a heaven and I know darned well
If I build my mountain with a lot of care
And take my daydream up the mountain
Heaven will be waiting there
Gonna build a mountain from a little hell
Gonna build a heaven and I know darned well
With a fine young son who will take my place
There'll be a sun in my heaven on earth
With the lord's good grace
When I build that heaven as I will some day
Gonna build a new life throw the old away
You and I together gonna make life swing
We'll fill tomorrow full of happiness
Gonna make the whole world swing
We'll fill tomorrow full of happiness
Gonna make the whole world swing
We'll fill tomorrow full of happiness
Make the whole world swing
