My baby don't care for shows
My baby don't care for clothes
My baby just cares for me
Ooh, my baby don't care for cars and races
My baby don't care for those high-toned places
Liz Taylor is not his style
And even Lana Turner's smile
It's something he can't see
My baby don't care who knows it
My baby just cares for me

My baby don't care for shows
And he even don't care for clothes
My baby just cares for me
My baby don't care for cars and races
My baby don't care for, he don't care for high-toned places
Liz Taylor is not his style
And even Lana Turner's smile
It's something, something he can't see
I wonder what's wrong with my baby
'Cause my baby just cares for, my baby just cares
My baby just cares for me
