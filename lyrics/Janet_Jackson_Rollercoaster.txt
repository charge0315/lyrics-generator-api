Darkchild, hahahaha
Brave a bone, oh

Ah, you make me up and down through emotions
Like a rollercoaster
Spinnin' like a ferris wheel
Ah, you turn me upside down with my feelings
And I know the reason
Baby, your love is surreal

You make me go, you make me go, you make me go
You make me go, you make me go
You make me go, you make me go
Like a rollercoaster

There's a high level of love goin' on
The feelings are just way too strong
The reason that you got me gone
Is, baby, 'cause you turn me on
With a bit of it more than a little bit
I get addicted every time I get a hit of it
'Cause, oh, baby, you take me so high
When I'm on your rollercoaster ride

I'm in and out of love and it's all because
I can't make up my mind
I'm so confused, don't know what to do
And it's cause of you

Ah, you make me up and down through emotions
Like a rollercoaster
Spinnin' like a ferris wheel
Ah, you turn me upside down with my feelings
And I know the reason
Baby, your love is surreal

You make me go, you make me go, you make me go
You make me go, you make me go
You make me go, you make me go
Like a rollercoaster

Boy, you give me butterflies
So deep inside
Breaks me down when I look in those eyes
Takes me out way across the sky
Baby boy, I won't lie
Usually I'm not this shy
You do it to me every time
I get on your rollercoaster ride

I'm in and out of love and it's all because
I can't make up my mind
I'm so confused, don't know what to do
And it's cause of you

Ah, you make me up and down through emotions
Like a rollercoaster
Spinnin' like a ferris wheel
Ah, you turn me upside down with my feelings
And I know the reason
Baby, your love is surreal

You make me go, you make me go, you make me go
You make me go, you make me go
You make me go, you make me go (Wanna ride?)
Like a rollercoaster (Hahaha)

'Cause you make me go up and down (Up and down)
And around and around and (Round and round)
I can't take it (Ooh, baby)
You make me go up and down (Ooh, baby)
And around and around (Around)
That's why, boy, I can't take it

I'm in and out of love and it's all because
I can't make up my mind
I'm so confused, don't know what to do
And it's cause of you

Ah, you make me up and down through emotions (Baby)
Like a rollercoaster (Ooh, ah)
Spinnin' like a ferris wheel (Give it back, ooh)
Ah, you turn me upside down with my feelings (Oh, oh)
And I know the reason
Baby, your love is surreal
Ah, you make me up and down through emotions
Like a rollercoaster
Spinnin' like a ferris wheel
Ah, you turn me upside down with my feelings
And I know the reason
Baby, your love is surreal

You make me go, you make me go, you make me go
You make me go, you make me go
You make me go, you make me go
Like a rollercoaster
