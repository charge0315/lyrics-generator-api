This man is in your control, just a word from you
You light my world with a billion stars
And make my dreams come true
A change has come to our life, I'm not saying it's wrong
We've reached the point where we have to decide
If we should go on, you already know where I stand
So it's all up to you
The choice is yours what we're gonna do
It's in your hands, in your hands
I'll have to wait until you make your plans
Should we try to make it alright, start it all again
Should we say this love affair never should have been, no
Just let me know what it's gonna be, be
It's all up to you
The choice is yours what we're gonna do
It's in your hands
I'll have to wait until you make your plans, ohh yeah
It's all, all up to you
The choice is yours what we're gonna do
It's in your hands, in your hands
I'll have to wait until you make your plans
It's all up to you
The choice is yours what we're gonna do
It's all up to you
It's up to you if we're making through
