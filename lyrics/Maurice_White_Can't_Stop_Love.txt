Everybody's talkin'
They're askin' around 'bout me and you
But love only knows the truth
I'm tryin' to fight this feelin'
They tell us our love will not survive
They don't know what we feel inside
Nothing they say can take away
The fire that's in my heart
Baby, I need your warm embrace, yeah
Can't stop love from reachin' everybody, yeah
You never need a reason why (woah, yeah, ow)
Can't stop love from touchin' everybody, yeah
You gave a meaning to my life, (yeah, ooo)
It's hard to believe sometimes
You could be here and I'm loving you
'Cause you're such a dream come true
People don't understand it
They see a smile upon my face
'Cause I found that special place
Every moment that we share in this world
With every boy and girl
They will always believe
Can't stop love reachin' everybody, yeah
You never need a reason why
Can't stop love from touchin' everybody, oh yeah
You gave a meaning to my life (woah, yeah)
Fighting hard to keep it all together, oh yeah
Sometimes I wonder if it's worth it, yeah
Many times I know it's hard to see, yeah, woah, oh
But I believe
Yes I believe, yeah
Can't stop love, yeah, from reachin' everybody, yeah
You never need a reason why
Can't stop love, oh oh, from touchin' everybody
You gave a meaning to my life
Can't stop this love, you can't stop love, baby
There's fire in my heart and it's burnin', baby
Let's give in to the joy that we're feelin', baby, yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah
Can't stop this love, you can't stop love, baby
There's fire in my heart and it's burnin', baby
Give in to the joy that we're feelin', baby, yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah
