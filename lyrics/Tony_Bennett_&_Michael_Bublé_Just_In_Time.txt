Just in time, I found you just in time
Before you came my time was runnin' low
Yes, I was lost, the losin' dice were tossed
My bridges are all crossed, nowhere to go
Take it, Michael

Now you're here and now I know just where I'm goin'
No more doubt or fear, I found my way
For love came just in time and you found us just in time
And changed our lonely lives that lovely day

We were lost, the losin' dice were tossed
Our bridges are all crossed, nowhere to go

Well, now we're here and now we know just where we're goin'
No more doubt or fear, we found our way
For love came just in time, we found you just in time
And changed our lonely lives that lovely day
Changed our lonely lives that lovely day
