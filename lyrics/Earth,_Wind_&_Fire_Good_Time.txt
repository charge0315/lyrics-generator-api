It's the kind of a night
You could use a friend
You're feeling a loss
And you need a win
A perfect eleven
Between one and ten
Got the right way
To make a sad night end
And if my mind
Was being read
She made a natural move
As if I'd said
She wanted to slow dance
I wanted to know her
My mind is on romance
And I want to score her

Oooh Oooh!

Rock and Roll
To R&B
Operating symphony
Don't know what she said
Do know what she meant
One arm pointed
Other arm bent
Making sounds you
Seldom hear
Moved her head
Make it all clear
She gave me a card
For the handicapped
Say I'm a specialist
At body wrap, no

Oooh Oooh!
Kind of a night you can use a friend

Come on, let's break down

Come into my world
Be a believer, yeah
A living achiever, oh yeah
See what your thoughts can guarantee
See what your thoughts can guarantee
Don't you worry, 'cause your heart will deliver
Trust the music, the universal giver
Come to the party, let your feet do the talkin'
Free your mind to explain that you
