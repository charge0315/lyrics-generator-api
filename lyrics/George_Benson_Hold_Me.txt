When the picture tells it all
There's no need for trying or pretending
You whip your suitcase in the hall
It's not a time for lying, no more crying
I gave up what I may never see, return to me

Hold me, like you used to do before
Let me wrap my arms around you, baby
You told me that you'd never leave no more
So I wrap my life around you

Before the pleasure turns to shame
It's a time for leaving not deceiving
And though a promise has been made
I would never hold you from what you need to do
You keep the years
But the moments I'll keep near forever dear

Hold me, like you used to do before
Let me wrap my arms around you, baby
You told me that you'd never leave no more
So I wrap my life around you

I gave a heart that I may never see return to me

Hold me, like you used to do before
Let me wrap my arms around you, baby
You told me that you'd never leave no more
So I wrap my life around you

The passage of years
My song you might hear
In some caught-up and lonely café
And wonder could it ever be
That good again
Guess we'll never know (We'll never know)

Hold me, like you used to do before
Let me wrap my arms around you, baby
You told me that you'd never leave no more
So I wrap my life around you
Hold me, like you used to do before
Let me wrap my arms around you, baby
You told me that you'd never leave no more
So I wrap my life around you
Hold me, like you used to do before
Let me wrap my arms around you, baby
You told me that you'd never leave no more
So I wrap my life around you
