My hands wrapped around
Strokin', up and down
(Is all this for me?)
But nothing can compare to the warmth of my mouth
(Thank you)
I love every sound you make when I'm down
(It's so big)
Nothing can prepare you for the warmth of my
(Can I taste it?)

Mouth against your mouth, getting you aroused
Whisper in your ear, I think I'll take it further south
Kissin' on your neck, rubbin' on your leg
Slide a little further up, I feel you get erect
And now we're flesh against flesh
Breathin' on your chest, so anxious to touch it
Ooh, my mouth is getting wet
Just like the water from the shore, let your rain pour
Baby, brace yourself for the warmth of my mouth

My hands wrapped around
Strokin', up and down
(Is all this for me?)
But nothing can compare to the warmth of my mouth
I love every sound you make when I'm down
Nothing can prepare you for the warmth of my mouth

There's no place warmer than my mouth

Start off slow, circles
(Okay, we're just gonna start off slow)
Then deeper and deep it goes
(Oh yeah, you like that, here I go)
Kisses so sensual, tasteful
(It tastes so good to me)
I love givin' you a show
(Wait, not yet)
The warmth of my mouth

My hands wrapped around, strokin', up and down
(How much longer can you last?)
But nothing can compare to the warmth of my mouth
I love every sound you make when I'm down
(I feel you getting closer)
Nothing can prepare you for the warmth of my mouth
(Mmm)
(Do you like that, or this? Mmm)
(Uh, mmm, and now it's my turn)
