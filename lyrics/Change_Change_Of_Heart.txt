Give me back all my love
I've had a change of heart
Give me back all my love
I've had a change of heart

I have opened up my eyes, now I can see clearly
You told there's no other guy who would be as good to me
I fell in love, and didn't stop to think what you were doing
But now I know, I don't need you at all, you're no good for me
I've changed my mind, I'm taking back my love

Give me back all my love
I've had a change of heart
Give me back all my love
I've had a change of heart
Give me back all my love
I've had a change of heart
Give me back all my love
I've had a change of heart

I would never let you down so you began to use me
You were always afraid of my female sensitivity
(And you knew that)
I do my best to give you what you want and you abuse me
It's time you go, I'd rather be alone without the heartache
I've changed my mind, I'm taking back my love

Give me back all my love
I've had a change of heart
Give me back all my love
I've had a change of heart
Give me back all my love
I've had a change of heart
Give me back all my love
I've had a change of heart

(Change of heart)
You made me change my mind, yeah, yeah
I'm takin' back all the love I gave to you, baby
(Change of heart)
Oh, yeah, you, yeah, you
Yeah, you
(Change of heart)
You, give it back to me
(Change of heart)
I'm taking back my love
