Will you ever see me
Like a possible lover again?
I am fed up to be
Your twin brother you're not my sister
And everytime
I think of that
I want to...
I wanna say to you
I wanna talk to you
When I look into your eyes
I see a yellow butterfly
When I look into your eyes
I see a yellow butterfly
Flying high in a beautiful
Summer sky
Everytime I look into your eyes
I see a reflection of me
A distorted vision
Of reality
Don't waste your time
Trying to find a meaning
To everything
You might get disappointed
I'd reallylike to experience
Something personal
Something I would never hear or feel
In someone else's song
I often get the feeling
That there's something missing
Iwish I were that yellow butterfly
Sparkling in your eyes
Don't waste your time
Trying to find a meaning
To everything
You might get disappointed
I think you should know better by now
I think you should know better
In the back of my mind
There are so many things I don't want you to know
I don't want you to know
In the back of my mind
There are so many things I don't want you to know
In the back of my mind
There are so many things I don't want you to know
I don't want you to know...
I think you should know better by now
I think you should know better
I should know better(yellow butterfly)
You should know better (yellow butterfly)
When I look into your eyes...
When I look into your eyes...
When I look into your eyes, eyes
Yellow Butterfly
