I'm a moonshiner's daughter
And I'll fight you if you wanna
I was born to break the law
If that wildcat burns blue
Then you know that it is true
I'll be the best damn runner you ever saw

I was born in a shack at the foot of the hill
Didn't know my ma and I never will
She labored two days and when it was done
She died of despair 'cause I wasn't a son
But I laced my boots and as I grew higher
Daddy taught me all about lightning and fire
I dogged that old man by the heel
And when I was twelve, got behind the wheel
Daddy and I, we got it real good
We knew every shortcut through these woods
He delivered the dew and I held the gun
And he didn't much care that I wasn't a son

I'm a moonshiner's daughter
And I'll fight you if you wanna
I was born to break the law
If that wildcat burns blue
Then you know that it is true
I'll be the best damn runner you ever saw

They think that they can tame me
But them men can't even name me
Am I girl? Am I woman?
Doesn't matter, I'm the best

Daddy's luck ran out one moonless night
The boys in blue had him in their sights
He told me to run and I never looked back
And I heard two shots on that back country track
Moonshine's my blood, running through my soul
And I never cared much about getting too old
I burned through this life and when it's the end
I'll stare death in the face just like him

I'm a moonshiner's daughter
And I'll fight you if you wanna
I was born to break the law
If that wildcat burns blue
Then you know that it is true
I'll be the best damn runner you ever saw
I'll be the best damn runner you ever saw
