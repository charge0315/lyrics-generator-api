I lock myself inside my room, I wanna be alone
With you around, you'll only add on, I wanna be alone
It's been disturbed by my thoughts, I wanna be alone
With you around, you'll only add on, I wanna be alone

Please don't think I'm crazy, I don't want you to understand
My mind is growing hazy, to hell with your helping hand
Why don't you just leave me alone, this conflict is my own
Keep yourselves away from me, that's all

I lock myself inside my room, I wanna be alone
With you around, you'll only add on, I wanna be alone
It's been disturbed by my thoughts, I wanna be alone
With you around, you'll only add on, I wanna be alone

Please don't think I'm crazy, I don't want you to understand
My mind is growing hazy, to hell with your helping hand
Why don't you just leave me alone, this conflict is my own
Keep yourselves away from me, that's all

I lock myself inside my room, I wanna be alone
With you around, you'll only add on, I wanna be alone
It's been disturbed by my thoughts, I wanna be alone
With you around, you'll only add on, I wanna be alone

Please don't think I'm crazy, I don't want you to understand
My mind is growing hazy, to hell with your helping hand
Why don't you just leave me alone, this conflict is my own
Keep yourselves away from me, that's all

I wanna be alone
