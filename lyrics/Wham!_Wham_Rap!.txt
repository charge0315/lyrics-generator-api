Uh
You got soul on the dole?
You're gonna have a good time
Down on the line
You got soul on the dole?
You're gonna have a good time
Down on the line
I said I get, get, get on down
I said I get, get, get on down
I said I get, get, get on down
I said I get, get, get on down

Hey, everybody, take a look at me
I've got street credibility
I may not have a job but I have a good time
With the boys that I meet down on the line
I said, D-H-S-S
Man, the rhythm that they're givin' is the very best
I said, B one, B two
Make the claims, on your name, all you have to do
Well, folks can be a drag, if work ain't your bag
And won't you let them know?
You're more dead than alive, in a nine to five
Then they say you'd got to go
And get yourself a job, or get out of this house
Get yourself a job, are you a man or a mouse?
A finger in each ear, you pretend not to hear
Gotta get some space, get out of this place

Wham, bam
I am a man
Job or no job, you can't tell me that I'm not
Do you enjoy what you do?
If not, just stop
Don't stay there and rot

In the streets, in the cars, on the underground
If you listen real hard, you can hear the sound
Of a million people, switching off for work
Well, listen Mr. Average, you're a jerk
Not me, you can't hold me down
Not me, I'm gonna fool around
Gonna have some fun, look out for number one
You can dig your grave, I'm staying young

Wham, bam
I am a man
Job or no job, you can't tell me that I'm not
Do you enjoy what you do?
If not, just stop
Don't stay there and rot

If you're a pub man or a club man
Maybe a jet black guy with a hip hi-fi
A white cool cat with a trilby hat
Maybe leather and studs is where you're at
Make the most of every day
Don't let hard times stand in your way
Give a wham, give a bam but don't give a damn
'Cause the benefit gang are gonna pay

Now reach up high and touch your soul
The boys from Wham! will help you reach that goal
It's gonna break your mama's heart (So sad)
It's gonna break your daddy's heart (Too bad)
But you'll throw the dice and take my advice
'Cause I know that you're smart
Can you dig this thing? (Yeah!)
Are you gonna get down? (Yeah!)
Say wham! (Wham!)
Say bam! (Bam!)

Wham, bam
I am a man
Job or no job, you can't tell me that I'm not
Do you enjoy what you do?
If not, just stop
Don't stay there and—
Wham, bam (D-H-S-S)
I am a man
Job or no job, you can't tell me that I'm not (D-H-S-S)
Do you enjoy what you do? (D-H-S-S)
If not, just stop (D-H-S-S)
Don't stay there and—
Wham, bam (D-H-S-S)
I am a man
Job or no job, you can't tell me that I'm not (D-H-S-S)
Do you enjoy what you do? (D-H-S-S)
If not, just stop (D-H-S-S)
Don't stay there and rot
