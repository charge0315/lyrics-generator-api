Living in a border town
You see good men get pushed around
It's not hard to see that they are my brothers
If it one for faith we might be each other
Living in a border town
You see women and children get hunted down
Silly fools in their big green vans
Viciously attempt to keep our people from their fatherland
Power, they really feel the bad good christians
As they defend this evil system
Abillybopa they
Can you dig what I a say
A bloodstain is drear
Has been glorified in this society
The glut is put in pace for submission
Araising memories
Is to crucify the poor men's identity
(Stolen land)
Five hundred years of misery
Could never be redeemed so easily
How can we call these people aliens
When we here are standing and stoling brow
And them wanna keep in mistery
The biggest scam in all of history
Abillybopa they someday
Them have to pay
Nuestra paciencia ya se acabo
No quieres acertar mi gente
Nos de gracias en nuestra propria tierra
Jah no nos puedes despreciar
Ay Dios mio no hay mas que dar
