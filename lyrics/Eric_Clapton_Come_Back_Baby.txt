Oh, come back, baby
Oh mama, please don't go
Child, the way I love you
Well, you'll never know

Oh come back, baby, yeah, yeah
Let's talk it over one more time

Well I admit, baby
That I was wrong
Don't you know, baby
Child, you've been gone too long

I said, if I could holler
Like a mountain jack
I'd go up on the mountain
People, I'd call my baby back

Now one of these days, baby
And it won't be long, yeah
You're going to look for me, child
You know, and I'll be gone
