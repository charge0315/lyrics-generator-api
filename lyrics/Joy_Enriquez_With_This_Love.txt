Verse 1 :
With this love, I hereby promise to
Stay with you come what may
With this love, I give my all to you
Forever and always
When I needed to be stronger
When I could not carry on
When I though I would fail
You were with me all along
So this love is very dear to me
And cannot be denied
With this love i vow that I will be
Forever by your side
Hook :
I was lost and I was lonely
And my heart was so afraid
Then you lifted me up
And you wiped the tears away
Now your love lives in a place I place
No other one above
And my heart, as long as I may live
I give you with this love
