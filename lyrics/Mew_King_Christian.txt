1577, there was born a king of architectual passion
Placed in dire peril, he would stand tall and erect, in retrospect

All I do is run tonight
Even twice as sweet but half as bright
I did not intend to impersonate a friend
If I didn't know my luck
Listen to the clock's last ticking tock
I shall ascend at last like a question never asked

Think him not so good-natured
Oh, no, not the slightest bit, quite the opposite
Because even though he would build things
He unto his queen was mean, poor Anna Kathrine, she's crying

All I do is run tonight
Even twice as sweet but half as bright
I did not intend to impersonate a friend
I could not remain your friend
Lest it would have made a difference then
Could it possibly? Well, no thanks to you and me

Hey, this is the king speakin' to you
Bet you didn't think I'd make it this far but I know you all remember old Christian
I was number four, you see, and people will think of me and say: A good king was he!
All I do is run tonight
Even twice as sweet but half as bright
If I didn't know my luck
Listen to the clock's last ticking tock

All I do is run tonight (All I do is run)
Even twice as sweet but half as bright (Even twice as sweet but half as bright)
I did not intend to impersonate a friend (I did not intend)
If I didn't know my luck (If I didn't know)
Listen to the clock's last ticking tock
I shall ascend at last, like a question never asked (I shall ascend to you again)
All I do is run tonight (All I do is run)
Even twice as sweet but half as bright (Even twice as sweet but half as bright)
I did not intend to impersonate a friend (I did not intend)
If I didn't know my luck (If I didn't know)
Listen to the clock's last ticking tock
I shall ascend at last, like a question never asked (I shall ascend to you again)
All I do is run tonight (All I do is run)
Even twice as sweet but half as bright (Even twice as sweet but half as bright)
I did not intend to impersonate a friend (I did not intend)
If I didn't know my luck (If I didn't know)
Listen to the clock's last ticking tock
I shall ascend at last, like a question never asked (I shall ascend to you again)
