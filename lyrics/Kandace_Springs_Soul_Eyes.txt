A soul, I'm told
Can be both hot and cold
So how is one to know
Which way to go?
The soul is mirrored in the eyes
But how is one to know
When the whole world is full of such lies?
So darling, watch those eyes
And even more, those lies
And when you see them smile
For a long, long while
Then you know you've found the one
Who'll always, always be true
I know, that it is how I found you
