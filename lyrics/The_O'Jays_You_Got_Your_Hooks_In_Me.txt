I just can't understand for the life of me
What I see in you
Yet every time you talk of leavin' me
I get so shook up, I don't know what to do

Oh, oh, baby, I guess you've got your hooks in me
And I, oh I, oh I'm caught like a fish
And, baby, I just can't break free
You know this thing is killin' me

I must like it or, or I wouldn't be here, baby
Every time I get behind your back
I tell my friends I'm leavin' you
And when you question me about it, baby
I swear what they're sayin' just ain't true, no, no

Oh, oh, oh, baby, I guess you've got your hooks in me
And I, oh, oh, I'm caught like a fish, y'all
And, baby, I just can't break free
You know this thing is killin' me, killin' me
Oh, baby, I guess you've got your hooks in me
I'm going to keep on loving you, loving you, loving you
Oh, baby, baby, baby, baby, I guess, I guess you've got your hooks in me
Oh, but, and I must like it, I must, I must like it, like it
Oh, baby, I guess you've got your hooks in me
Baby, what you do to me, what you do to me
I guess you've got your hooks in me
I said woman, it's good to me, good to me, so good to me
And I like it, I like it
Oh, baby, I-I guess you've got your hooks in me
I'm in love with you woman, and I don't want to quit
I just don't want to quit
I want to hold you, I want to hold you close to me
Oh, baby, I guess you've got your hooks in me
Yeah, sweet woman, I love, I'm loving you
And I'm hooked, I'm hooked, oh baby, oh baby
Oh, baby

I got, I'm gonna get away
You got poor me hangin' on a string, darlin'
Oh, I must like this thing, woo-hoo
So woman, woman, do the things that you do
The way, the way you call my name, woman, I like it
I'll be goin' around tellin' all my friends that I'm leavin'
No, and I ain't never goin' nowhere, no, no
I said woman, I said woman
The way, the way you love me, way you love me
I feel, feel, feel, feel like I feel, I want, got to have it

Oh baby, I guess you've got your hooks in me
Oh baby, I guess you've got your hooks in me
Little girl, little girl, you got me, you got me
You got me hooked, child, child, and I like it, I like it
Oh baby, I guess
