I love to love you, baby
I love to love you, baby
I love to love you, baby
I love to love you, baby
I love to love you, baby

When you're laying so close to me
There's no place I'd rather you be
Than with me

I love to love you, baby (Oh, love to love ya)
I love to love you, baby
I love to love you, baby

Do it to me again and again
You put me in such a awful spin
In a spin, in-uh

Ahaaw, I love to love you, baby
Ahaaw, I love to love you, baby
Ahaaw, I love to love you, baby

Lay your head down real close to me
Soothe my mind and set me free
Set me free, uh

Ahaaw, I love to love you, baby
Ahaaw, I love to love you, baby
Oh, love to love you, baby

Ahaaw, I love to love you, baby
Ahaaw, I love to love you, baby
Ahaaw, I love to love you, baby

When you're laying so close to me
There's no place I'd rather you be
Than with me

I love to love you, baby (Love to love you)
I love to love you, baby
I love to love you, baby

Do it to me again and again
You put me in such a awful spin
In a spin, in-uh

I love to love you, baby
I love to love you, baby
I love to love you, baby
I love to love you, baby
I love to love you, baby
I love to love you, baby
I love to love you, baby (Ah, honey)
I love to love you, baby (Love to love you baby)
I love to love you, baby (Ahh)
