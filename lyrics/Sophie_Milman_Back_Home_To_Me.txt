Lazy swallow flying homeward
Watch the river wind back slowly to the sea
Oh, my soul is waiting patiently
Will you ever find your way back home to me?

Somewhere I lost upon the journey
A love that was mislaid somewhere in time
Oh, my love, my heart is aching for you
Will you ever find your way back home to me?

Sometimes I feel I almost touch you
I turn and almost see your face
For a moment my heart stops
Till the crowd moves on and fills the space

Oh, my life will be here waiting
For you, my love, to find your way back home to me

Sometimes I feel I almost touch you
I turn and almost see your face
For a moment my heart stops
Till the crowd moves on and fills the space

Oh, my life will be here waiting
For you, my love, to find your way
Oh baby, find your way
Please baby, find your way back home to me
