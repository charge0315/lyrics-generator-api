Disco Baby

Ever see a room start rockin'
Ever see the ceilin' fall?
Ever see a dance floor burnin' up
From wall to wall?
Disco Baby
Disco Baby
When she grooves
She makes the moves
That drive you crazy
That's my disco baby
Freakin' out the discothèque

When they play a real bad record
And the beat is really cool
Everybody claps their hands
And watches you know who
Disco baby
Disco baby
When she grooves
She makes the moves
That drive you crazy
That's my disco Baby
Freakin' out the discothèque
