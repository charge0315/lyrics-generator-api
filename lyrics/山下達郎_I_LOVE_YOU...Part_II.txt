(I love you)
I love your gentle nature
And your skin, so soft and warm
But I know you're tough enough
To make it through the storm
When the sun comes out again
I'll be holding your hand
Cause I love you
Cause it feels like we're dancing
When we're walking together
And when I have a bad day, darling
You can make it all better
You believe in my dream
You and I, we're such a team
That's why I love you
Passion never goes out of fashion
But it's hollow when it's followed by goodbye
I don't want to be clever and talk about forever
But I think I see tomorrow when I look into your eyes
I love you for the way
That you bend without breaking
And it's so good to feel
That it's real love we're making
Cause after the thrill
When we're lying so still
I still love you
I really do
