Listen to the clock on the wall
It's getting mighty late
Closer to the hour when we have to separate
Listen to the clock on the wall
It's moving much too fast
Girl, I love this feeling and I want this feeling to last

You step out to see me
And I step out to see you
We don't have much time
To blow each other's minds
Girl, you better hurry (I, I)
Your husband might get worried
And my wife, she doesn't see
The change in me

Listen to the clock on the wall
It's getting, getting mighty late
Closer to the hour when we have to separate
Listen to the clock on the wall
It's moving, moving much too fast
Girl, I love this feeling and I want this feeling to last

Someday we'll be together (I, I)
Forever and ever
Then we won't have to worry
We won't have to hurry
But now we gotta hurry (Come on, come on)
'Cause your husband might get worried
And my wife, she doesn't see
The change in me
Oh, you better

Ooh-ooh
Oh, yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Ooh-ooh, ooh
Oh
Oh
Ah-ah

Listen to the clock on the wall
It's getting, getting, getting mighty late
Closer to the hour when we have to separate
Listen to the clock on the wall
It's moving, moving, moving much too fast
Girl, I love this feeling and I want this feeling to last
You better

Listen to the clock on the wall
(Oh, baby now)
(Oh, don't stop, won't you)
(I just don't wanna leave you baby, if you ready)
Listen to the clock on the wall
(Girl, I love you, oh)
(Come on baby, oh, come on)
(Come on baby, baby)
Listen to the clock on the wall
(Just wanna stay with you)
