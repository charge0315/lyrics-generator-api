All of my life
I've been searching for someone
Whose love was right
And could be relied on
Before tonight
I never thought I'd discover
Such a perfect lover
Show me that it's real

Turn on your love lite
Baby come treat me right
And then let me know what I can do for you
Turn on your love lite
Take me to a greater height
Do it one more time and I'll believe it's true

Day after day
I kept my heart disconnected
I thought this way
I'd be well protected
But meeting you
Suddenly sent my head reeling
I couldn't fight the feeling
Even if I tried

Turn on your love lite
Baby come treat me right
And then let me knwo what I can do for you
Turn on your love lite
Take me to a greater height
Do it one more time and I'll believe it's true

Make it last a lifetime
Get beneath my skin
I don't want to wake up
From this dream that I'm in
 X3
Turn on your love lite
Baby come treat me right
And then let me know what I can do for you
Turn on your love lite
Take me to a greater height
Do it one more time and I'll believe it's true
