I wanna talk about it
A colonized mind

Upload, the evolution principle
See a rock on the shore and say
"It's always been there"
Download, no responsibility
Do what you want, nobody cares
Upload, the master race idea
Genetically disposed to rule the world
Download, a future full of isolated
Full of isolated boys and girls
Upload, a two-party system
The lesser of two dangers, illusion of choice
Download, a veiled form of fascism
Nothing really ever changes
You never had a voice
Listen to me one time

If you look, you're sure going to find
Throughout mankind's history
A colonized mind
The one in power makes law
Under which the colonized fall
But without God
It's just the blind leading the blind

Upload, a joint venture record deal
It's just another way for the man to steal
While he's sticking you with the bill
Download, the temporary acquisition
Of fleeting fame and fortune
Nothing to leave in your will
Hey, hey, hey, hey

Wait a minute
Upload, a child with no father
Download, no respect for authority
Upload, a child with no mother
Download, a hard time showing love

If you look, you're sure going to find
Through mankind's history
A colonized mind
The one in power makes laws
Under which the colonized fall
But without God
It's just the blind leading the blind
