Said you're a friend of mine
But friends don't make each other cry
Baby---
Gave you my happiness
But you tell me that I'm like the rest
Like the rest

Can't you see just what you're doing to me, baby?
Tell me why you broke your promise to me, baby
Can't you see just what you're doing
To me?

Said that our love would last
But it looks as though it's in the past
Baby---
Now that you put me down
All my girlfriends say that I'm a clown
I'm a clown

Can't you see just what you're doing to me, baby?
Tell me why you broke your promise to me, baby
Can't you see just what you're doing
To me?
Ooooooh, baby---- ey-ey--
Oo-ooh, ooh-ooh, oo-ooh

Can't you see just what you're doing to me, baby?
Tell me why you broke your promise to me, baby
Can't you see just what you're doing
To me, baby?
Can't you see just what you're doing to me, baby?
Tell me why you broke your promise to me, baby
Can't you see just what you're doing
To me, baby?
Can't you see just what you're doing to me, baby?
Tell me why you broke your promise to me, baby
Can't you see just what you're doing
To me, baby?
