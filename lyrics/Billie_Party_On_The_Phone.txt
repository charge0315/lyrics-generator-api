Na-na, na-na-na
Na-na, na-na-na
Na-na-na, na-na-na
Na-na, na-na

Sitting at home in my own world
On the phone to my best girls
Hear us ringing it, we're really swinging it
What are we doing? Oh
If you wanna get a new groove
We can show you all the right moves
We're really swinging it, ah, ring-a-dinging it
What are we doing?

Baby, baby, can I have your number?
Maybe, maybe we can get together
You're really gonna flip
When you make a trip
And get yourself connected (Everybody)

Having a party on the phone (Uh-huh, uh-huh)
Oh, yeah, yeah
Never any need to be alone (Check it out, check it out, check it out)
Oh, yeah, yeah
You can dial the number any time, day or night (Everybody, everybody, everybody)
Everybody swinging on the party line (Uh-huh, uh-huh)
So get ringing it

Na-na, na-na-na
Na-na, na-na-na (Party on the phone)
Na-na-na, na-na-na
Na-na, na-na (We're really swinging it)
Na-na, na-na-na
Na-na, na-na-na (Party on the phone)
Na-na-na, na-na-na
Na-na, na-na (Come on, come on, come on)

If you're feeling lonely in a strange town
Your one and only isn't around
Get into overdrive, come and check the vibe
And satisfy your soul
If you want a new direction
You can dance with your reflection
You'll soon be digging it and really living it
Totally in control

Baby, baby, can I have your number?
Maybe, maybe we can get together
You're really gonna flip
When you make a trip
And get yourself connected (Everybody)

Having a party on the phone (Uh-huh, uh-huh)
Oh, yeah, yeah
Never any need to be alone (Check it out, check it out, check it out)
Oh, yeah, yeah
You can dial the number any time, day or night (Everybody, everybody, everybody)
Everybody swinging on the party line (Uh-huh, uh-huh)
So get ringing it

Na-na, na-na-na
Na-na, na-na-na (Party on the phone)
Na-na-na, na-na-na
Na-na (We're really swinging it)

You can thrill, you can chill
You can do what you will
Ain't nothing we don't know
'Cos we generate the flow
Celebrate and elevate
Let the revolution start (Come on, come on, come on)
Right here, right now
Right here, right now

Baby, baby, can I have your number?
Maybe, maybe we can get together
You're really gonna flip
When you make a trip
And get yourself connected (Everybody)

Having a party on the phone (Uh-huh, uh-huh)
Oh, yeah, yeah
Never any need to be alone (Check it out, check it out, check it out)
Oh, yeah, yeah
You can dial the number any time, day or night (Everybody, everybody, everybody)
Everybody swinging on the party line (Uh-huh, uh-huh)
So get ringing it
Having a party on the phone (Uh-huh, uh-huh; Party on the phone)
Oh, yeah, yeah
Never any need to be alone (Check it out, check it out, check it out)
Oh, yeah, yeah
