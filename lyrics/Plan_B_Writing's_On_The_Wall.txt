We used to have fun
Now all we do is fight
We know something's wrong
It's clear something here ain't right
We ain't over but the writing's on the wall
We keep trying just so we can say we gave it all
We ain't over but the writing's on the wall
This time next year, we'll be no more, yeah

Talk about tomorrow, girl
It's only gonna end in tears, baby yeah
Our time is borrowed, girl
All we got left's right here

We used to talk
Now all we do is shout, oh yeah
Our heads full of thoughts
We could both do without
We ain't over but the writing's on the wall
We keep trying just so we can say we gave it all
We ain't over but the writing's on the wall
This time next year, we'll be no more, oh yeah

Talk about tomorrow, girl
It's only gonna end in tears, baby yeah
Our time is borrowed, girl
All we got left's right here, mm mm yeah
All we do is try
Try to make it all okay, baby yeah
We both know it's a waste of time
Things are never gonna change, mm mm

We both know we're hanging on here
But no one's gonna say it
So we'll just carry on like always
Acting like nothing's wrong, yeah
We ain't over but the writing's on the wall
We keep trying just so we can say we gave it all
We ain't over but the writing's on the wall
This time next year, we'll be no more, yeah

Talk about tomorrow, girl
It's only gonna end in tears, baby yeah
Our time is borrowed, girl
All we got left's right here, mm mm yeah
All we do is try
Try to make it all okay, baby yeah
We both know it's a waste of time
Things are never gonna change, mm mm

We ain't over but the writing's on the wall
We keep trying just so we can say we gave it all
We ain't over but the writing's on the wall
This time next year, we'll be no more
