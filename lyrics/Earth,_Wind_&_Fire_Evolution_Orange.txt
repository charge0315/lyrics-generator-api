Seeing
Seeing is believing
It's the greatest feeling
Knowing in your heart
Trust yourself
Look ahead
Feel the motion growing
Love is where it's going
This is where our real journey starts
Down through the years
Throughout the stars
Ancient the dream
Future evolves
Shining light
Now in sight
Evolution Orange
Wondrous flight
Now in sight
Evolution Orange
Patience
Healer and the giver
Patience will deliver
Fire from the spark
Trust yourself
Reach inside
Have no hesitation
Give no explanation
You know who you are
Down through the years
Throughout the stars
Ancient the dream
Future evolves
Shining light
Now in sight
Evolution Orange
Wondrous flight
Now in sight
Evolution Orange
