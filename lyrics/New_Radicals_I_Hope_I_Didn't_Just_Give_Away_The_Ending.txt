Mm
Oh
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah
Uh uh, yeah yeah, uh, yeah yeah yeah, uh
All my world's my say, you cry
I can't be the one no more, no more
'Cause you devoted the time, and you
'Cause I'm not givin' the time for you, oh, to be there
'Cause she's afraid I'm gonna
Why
Give you my world, world
'Cause you've been runnin' round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round
You want to be the world, oh yeahh (taken the time with you, taken the time, all this time just smoking weed there)
Yeah yeah yeah, h-huh, yeah yeah yeah (I just tried so hard)
A-sing it for me, said a-yeah yeah yeah
Ah, yeah yeah yeah, ah yeah
Sing for more of that
Wan' make believe you found half an out down there
She's in a real bad town, and they do have plans for you
They're driving down to the doo dat down
To the ambulance shop (I just wanna be there) Pick, pick it up, pick it up, yeah
Pick it up, pick it up, pick it up, yeah, yeah, baby baby
Baby, love make me care, I really really wanna, really wanna
Ooh ah ooh ah ooh ah ooh ah ooh ah
Shaddap
Ooh-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do

She wanted to be a nun until that fateful day we met
I beat the crucifix in a game of Russian roulette
I burned my Beatles records 'cause she hated "Number Nine"
She licked rock cocaine suckers, laughed, said her mom's doing mine

Are you an illusion
Or am I just getting stoned?
'Cause I can't take it alone
I can't take it alone
I hope I didn't just give away the ending

We started limping, caught the handicap shuttle to town
And yelled, "God's healed us" as we ran off the bus, the driver just frowned
By the way, this girl was sexy and she wouldn't touch you
That may not be true, but I said it so you'd feel involved with the song

Well, are you an illusion
Or am I just getting stoned?
'Cause I can't take it alone
I can't take it alone
I hope I didn't just give away the ending

We caught a fey taxi driver, I smiled, the ride was free
I felt like Amsterdam, she wanted more drugs and maybe me
I told her dealer I was broke, he hired a cameraman
We did a porno film for coke, I hear I'm big in Japan

Well, are you an illusion
Or am I just getting stoned?
'Cause I can't take it alone
I can't take it alone
I hope I didn't just give away the ending

We went back to her kitchen, put the coke all in a can
Tied up a T.V. minister, in walked her dad
He started drinking coffee, too much sugar on the go
He fell dead on the floor, he thought the coke was Sweet 'n' Low

Well, are you an illusion
Or am I just getting stoned?
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba

Man, was she upset, but then she stole her dad's wallet, and
I drove him to the hospital to sell all of his donatable body parts
And this is when she died, they brought a depressed junkie in
She shot his Cyanide up, I guess she thought it was Errol Flynn
I'm blamed in confusion (I'm blamed in the confusion)
The police, the police being phoned

I don't even love you
We weren't even friends

It's just that I can't take it alone
I can't take it alone
Uh uh
I can't take it alone

I hope I didn't just give away the ending
I hope I didn't just give away the ending
I hope I didn't just give away the ending
I hope I didn't just give away the ending
I hope I didn't just give away the ending
I hope I didn't just give away the ending
Aw Jesus, ah shit
I think I just gave away the ending
