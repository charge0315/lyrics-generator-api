I'd rather be hurt by you
Rather be hurt by you
Than to be loved by somebody else

I'd rather spend hours
Lonely and blue
Than one single moment
With somebody new

My friends say that some day I'll love again
And maybe some day I will, still

I'd rather be hurt by you
Rather be hurt by you
Even be left alone by myself
Than be loved by somebody else

My friends say that some day I'll love again
And maybe some day I will, still

I'd rather be hurt by you (Baby)
Rather be hurt by you (Baby)
Even be left alone by myself
Than be loved by somebody else

Rather be hurt by you, baby
Rather be hurt by you, baby
Rather be hurt by you, baby
I'd rather, rather, rather, rather be
