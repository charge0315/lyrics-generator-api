I'll give you love, I'll open up
My heart to you, girl
'Cause you're the one, I've waited for
Baby, all of my life, it's you, yeah yeah
I'm ready (Ready, I'm ready, baby, can't you see)
Oh, and this time, lady
It's the right time, baby, for love
I'm ready (Ready, I'm ready, baby, can't you see)
Oh, and this time, lady
It's the right time, honey, to be mine
I promise, girl, that I'll be there
Ain't goin' nowhere (I ain't goin' nowhere)
I won't hesitate, 'cause love don't wait
For anyone, not anyone, no, baby
I'm ready (Ready, I'm ready, baby, can't you see)
Oh, and this time, lady
It's the right time, baby, for love
'Cause I wanna love you
I'm ready (Ready, I'm ready, baby, can't you see)
Oh, and this time, lady
It's the right time, honey, to be mine
There comes a time in every man's life
He opens his eyes and then he realizes true love
Baby, this time I'll give my all to you
'Cause it's the right time for love
It's the right time for love
