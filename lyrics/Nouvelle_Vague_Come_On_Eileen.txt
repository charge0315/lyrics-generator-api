Poor old Johnny Ray
Sounded sad upon the radio
Moved a million hearts in mono
Our mothers cried
Sang along, who would blame them
You've grown, so grown
Now I must say more than ever
Toora loora, toora loora aye
We can sing just like our fathers
Come on, Eileen
Oh, I swear what I mean
At this moment you mean everything
You in that dress
Oh, my thoughts I confess verge on dirty
Oh, come on, Eileen
These people 'round here
Wear beaten down
Eyes sunk in, smoke dried faces
So resigned to what their fate is
But not us, no, not us
We are far too young and clever
Toora loora, toora loora, aye
Eileen, I'll hum this tune forever
Come on, Eileen
Oh, I swear what I mean
At this moment you mean everything
You in that dress
My thoughts I confess verge on dirty
Oh, come on, Eileen
Come on, Eileen
Oh, I swear what I mean
At this moment
Oh, come on, Eileen
