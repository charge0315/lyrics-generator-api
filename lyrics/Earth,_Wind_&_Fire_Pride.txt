Mighty men have come and gone
But the pride lingers on
Heritage will claim every man
With desire to make a stand
Some say the pride's for the strong
What's the use holding on
We say the pride's everyone
Who wants to come touch the sun
While you pout, is your world in doubt
It's all about life won't let you out of the scheme
Just believe your dreams
Pressing on self esteem
Now participate, time to love, motivate
Energies to say, brighter you, brighter day
Set your mind in view
Of the real man in you
Heed the call to all
Standing tall, not to fall
Time to check it out
Pride relieves all your doubt
We say the pride's everyone
Want to come touch the sun
