I've been lookin' all around
For something to change my mind
Felt like floatin' on the ground
And I wasn't satisfied with what I found
Woke up lookin' like a creep
'Cause I couldn't get no sleep
Snowflakes stirring to sleep
But my heart still beats for something sweet

Come on now, ease the pain
I ain't gonna fall for you again
So why don't you erase my name?
'Cause I won't ever feel the same

Could figure out what it's all about
I won't be there to hold you tight
Make a turn on the next runabout
Following the signs inside your mind
Yes, I've been here before
It's not gonna be like before
Yes, we've been here before
But I'm not gonna take it no more

Come on now, ease the pain
I ain't gonna fall for you again
So why don't you erase my name?
'Cause I won't ever feel the same

Ooh, I'm sorry, I'm just different from you
Ooh, I can't give you more than you want me to
Ooh, my life is near the end, you know it too
Come on now, ease the pain
Things will never be the same
Come on now, ease the pain
I ain't gonna fall for you again
So why don't you erase my name?
'Cause I won't ever feel the same
'Cause I won't ever feel the same

Come on now, ease the pain
I ain't gonna fall for you again
So why don't you erase my name?
'Cause I won't ever feel the same
Come on now, ease the pain
