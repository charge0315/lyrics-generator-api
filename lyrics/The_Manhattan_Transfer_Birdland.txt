5,000 light years from Birdland
But I'm still preachin' the rhythm
Long-gone, uptight years from Birdland
An' I'm still teachin' it with 'em
Years from the land of the Bird
An' I am still feelin' the spirit
5,000 light years from Birdland
But I know people can hear it
Bird named it, Bird made it, Bird heard it, then played it
Well-stated! Birdland--
It happened down in Birdland
Oh!
In the middle of that hub
I remember one jazz club
Where we went to pat feet
Down on fifty-secon' street
Everybody heard that word
That they named it after Bird
Where the rhythm swooped and swirled
The jazz corner of the world
An' the cats they gigged in there
Were beyond compare
Birdland - I'm singin' Birdland
Birdland - Ol' swingin' Birdland
Hey, man, the music really turns you on!
Y' turn me on
Really, y' turn me aroun'
'N turn me on
Down them stairs, lose them cares - where?
Down in Birdland
Total swing, bop was king - there
Down in Birdland
Bird would cook, Max would look - where?
Down in Birdland
Miles came through, 'Trane came too - there
Down in Birdland
Basie blew, Blakey too - where?
Down in Birdland
Cannonball played that hall - there
Down in Birdland
Yeah---
There may never be nothin' such as that
No Mo' - No Mo'
Down in Birdland, that's where it was at
I know - I know
Back in them days bop was ridin' high
Hello! 'n goodbye!
How well those cats remember
Their first Birdland gig
To play in Birdland is an honor we still dig
Yeah---that club was like--
In another world, sure enough--
Yeah, baby
All o' the cats had the cookin' on
People just sat an' they was steady lookin' on
Then Bird--he came 'n spread the word--
Birdland
Yes, indeed, he did
Yes, indeed, he did
Yes, indeed, he did
Yes, he did, Parker played at Birdland
Yes, he really did
Yes, indeed, he really did
Yes, he really did
Told the truth down in Birdland
Yes, indeed he did, Yardbird Parker played in
Birdland
Yes, indeed, he really did
Charlie Parker played in Birdland
Bird named it, Bird made it, Bird heard it
Then played it
Well-stated! Birdland
It happened down in Birdland
Everybody dug that beat
Everybody stomped their feet
Everybody digs be-bop
An' they'll never stop
Down them stairs, lose them cares - yeah!
Down in Birdland

Background Solo:
Come in pairs down them stairs, lose y' cares
Them that dares gits it!
Pay the gate, don't be late
It's a date! - whattay' know
If y' dig, then you'll dig, it's a groove
Quite a groove, 'cause y' t' move
Come in twos, pay your dues
What can you lose?
Just your blues!
So lose them!
The band swingin' one and all and what a ball!
Yeah!
Music is good, music is better than good
Pretty good
Very nice
Really very good - things are bein' like they should
Very good -- very good -- very good
All y' gotta do is lend an ear
An' listen to it
Then y' dig a little sooner than soon
You'll be diggin' everything diggin' all the music
What a ball!
How y' gonna figure out
A way t' bring it all about amid a
Lot o' other music on the set'n on
The scene know what I mean?
How y' gonna separate the music from the scene
'Gonna have t' keep the memory clean
Y' gonna hear a lotta' sound -- a lotta soun'
