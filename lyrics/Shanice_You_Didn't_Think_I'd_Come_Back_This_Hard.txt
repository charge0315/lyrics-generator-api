Busted
Yo, fellas
I'm back
And I'm hard as ever
Where'd you think I was gonna go (giggle)
Yeah, whatever
Hard
Hard
Shut up, you guys
Hard
You can't sing

Been working hard in the studio
Working day and night
Staying up and singing 14 hours
Trying to get it right
I'd rush home
Right after school
You see I couldn't hang out and be cool
I had a mission
I could not be dissing
Baby, uh
That was my rule

You didn't think I'd come back this hard
You didn't think I'd come back this hard
You didn't think I'd come back this hard
You didn't think I'd come back this hard

Rocking and bumping
Thumping and funking
Like this groove, yeah
I had to make you move
I had a mission that
I could not be dissing
'Cause this diva had a point to prove

Some people said (Huh?)
Where could she be?
Backing some band way down in Mississippi?
(No!)
Smacking, whacking
Jacking this groove in time
With the rhythm of hip-hop in mind

Everyday
Coast to coast
People what could it be
What's up with me
Well, I'm back
With a brand new story
I gotta fresh mix
Tarpan's laboratory
U.C
The fellas hook me up
From A to Z
1, 2, 3
It's me
Shanice
And I'm pulling other suckers
Ho, card
(Laugh)
You didn't think I'd come back this hard, boy

Uno, dos, tres, cuatro
Hard
Hard
Hard
Hard
Hard
Hard
Hard
Hard
Hard
Hard
