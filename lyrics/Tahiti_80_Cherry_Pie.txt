I was there, I was watchin'
Hidden in my time machine
Couldn't understand a thing
That was quite a feeling
Cried my blues away
That was enough for one day
I was watchin' city lights
They had turned from red to green
Wishing I was there with you
But I guess I like here, too
Better go back to bed
Before I go out of my head
This is the evening of the day
Another chapter is ending
I can't wait till the morning comes
I was so surprised to see
That the word was everywhere
Maybe it's a sign for me
Saying I should change my mind
I'll think about it later on
No time for that right now
Got a feeling when I'm back
Our lives are gonna change for good
Hopefully we're on the right track
Feels like we're both in the mood
We're getting closer, closer
To the next page in the book
This is the evening of the day
Another chapter is ending
I can't wait till the morning comes
My mind is full of things to do
Don't know where to start yet
I can't wait till the morning comes
(Gotta move)
