Baby, maybe you're an angel
Love made its incision
Maybe I'm your victim, oh no
Lately I'm inclined to tell you
I've made my decision
Not to let you go, oh no
Now, don't say that love is dying
We've got to keep on trying
Never letting go

Baby, loving you feels right
I want to tell you
It doesn't matter what the price
I will always greet
Every sacrifice
Over and over

Tell me, why is love so fragile
It's a blue condition
Something that can't be defined
And tell me
How can I be mellow
If the love is dying

Loving you feels right
I want to tell you
It doesn't matter what the price
I will always greet
Every sacrifice
Over and over
Loving you feels right
I want to tell you
It doesn't matter what the price
I will always greet
Every sacrifice
Over and over
