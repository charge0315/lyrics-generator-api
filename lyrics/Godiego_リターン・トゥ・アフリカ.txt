僕らは生きる大切なもの
ここで見つけて　残したい
生きる力が　あふれてる
生き物たちが　サバンナ駆ける
命がここは　きらめくよ
僕らは何を失くし
そうして何を手にした
どちらがいいのか
Return to Africa
Regain your heart again
アフリカに帰れよ
生きる道を　さがすんだ
Return to Africa
Return to Africa
We once were simple and true
Strong but gentle too
Blood is on your hands
It's soaked into the land
You've started wondering
Is this what you were wanting
I hold the secret key
To what you really need
The key to a rediscovery
Of the soul in you and me
Return to Africa
Regain your heart again
Take the long road home
There's nothing you can own
Here in Africa
I'm waiting here for you
Return to Africa, return to Africa
Return to Africa, return to Africa
Return to Africa.....
