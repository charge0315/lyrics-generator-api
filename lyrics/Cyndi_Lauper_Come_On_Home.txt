It will be
Whatever it is you're looking for
It will be
Whatever it is you need
It will be better
Even though I know you're not sure
Remember the rain even comes down
In Shangri-La
Look up as it soaks into your skin
And remember who you are and...
Come on home
When the road that you've
Been walking gets too long
Don't be scared
In case the grass you thought was
Greener isn't there
You can come on home
If you find the sun don't shine
Through every window
If you find a moonlit night
Still makes you blue
If you find out why you
Feel the way you do
Glance over your shoulder boy
You know I'll be there
I've found in the past you know
Sometimes life isn't fair so..
Come on home
When the road that you've been
Walking gets too long
Don't be scared
In case the grass you thought
Was greener isn't there
You can come on home...
When life isn't fair
Don't go there
You can come on home...
