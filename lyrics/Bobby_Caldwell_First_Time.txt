Wise men wait
They'll always put their trust in fate
Fools never take the time
For love to really grow
They just don't know

And lonely dreamers
Wonder if they will ever find romance
My heart knew it
Till you shot your arrow thru it

For the first time
Love is waiting at the door
I've never felt this before
Now I know the score
Darling for the first time, first time

No more nights
Of missing the essential things
You've brought back to my life
And everything you are, feels so right

Oh lonely dreamer
Did you ever think we would find romance?
Lets get started, putting both are hearts into it!

For the first time
Love is waiting at the door
There had to be something more
Now I know the score
Darling for the first time, first time

I only want to do, the things that other lovers do
And if you feel the same put your arms around me
If your tired of being one who's just dreaming

Oh lonely dreamers
Wonder if they will ever find romance
My heart knew it
Till you shot your arrow thru it

For the first time
I know what I've been searching for
Their had to be something more
Now I know the score
Darling for the first time
Love is waiting at the door
I've never felt this before
Now I know the score
Darling for the first time
