Ooh-ah, ooh

My love, she throws me like a rubber ball (Oh, the sweetest thing)
But she won't catch me or break my fall (Oh, the sweetest thing)
Baby's got blue skies up ahead, but in this, I'm a raincloud
You know she wants a dry kind of love (Oh, the sweetest thing)

I'm losin' you
I'm losin' you, yeah
Ain't love the sweetest thing?

I wanted to run, but she made me crawl (Oh, the sweetest thing)
Eternal fire, she turned me to straw (Oh, the sweetest thing)
I know I got black eyes, but they burn so brightly for her
Guess it's a blind kind of love (Oh, the sweetest thing)

I'm losin' you
Woah, I'm losin' you
Ain't love the sweetest thing? (Ain't love the sweetest thing?)
(Ain't love the sweetest thing?) Ain't love the sweetest thing?

Not hate
Not hate

Blue-eyed boy meets a brown-eyed girl (Oh, the sweetest thing)
You can sew it up, but you still see the tear (Oh, the sweetest thing)
Baby's got blue skies up ahead, but in this, I'm a raincloud
Ours is a stormy kind of love (Oh, the sweetest thing)

Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo (The sweetest thing)
Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo (Oh, the sweetest thing)
