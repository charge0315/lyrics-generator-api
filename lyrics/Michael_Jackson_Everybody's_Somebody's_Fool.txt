Everybody's somebody's fool (Everybody's somebody's fool)

You go through life making fools of others
Pretending you're giving them love
But remember, sister or brother
You all have to answer to the one up above (To the one up above)

But, oh, so sad when it ends (So sad when it ends)
As you go through life, remember this rule
Everybody's somebody's fool (Everybody's somebody's fool)

Uh-huh
Ooh, a-ha
Shoo-ba, shoo-ba

As you go through life remember this rule
Everybody's somebody's fool (Everybody's somebody's fool)

Everybody's, everybody's somebody's fool, yeah
