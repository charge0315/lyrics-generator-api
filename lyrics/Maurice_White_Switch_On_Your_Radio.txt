Every time I think about the good times, wanna sing and shout
I am the melody, I walk the city wild and free
Just keep on getting down, and groovin' to the best around
My name is "Sam the Jam", let me take you by the hand
With every step let's touch the beat
With the streets alive, the rhythm takes your feet
Break out
We're coming out
Switch on your radio
Let's break out
We're steppin' out
Switch on your radio
There ain't no limit, girl, you hear my voice around the world
You'll learn to know my name, dancin' on the hot airwaves
Come on and listen to, listen to the groove in you
I'll make your body talk, jammin' all your fears away
It's time to let the thunder roll
When lighting strikes, it'll surely light your soul
Break out
We're coming out
Switch on your radio
Let's break out
We're steppin' out
Switch on your radio
Turn on to life, celebrate and come alive
For your heart can't wait, let the music lead the way
Here's a groove, good to you
Let your body talk, let's jam!
Break out
We're coming out
Switch on your radio
Let's break out
We're steppin' out
And when we step out, step out, step out
Break out
We're coming out
When we break out, break, break out
Let's break out
We're steppin' out
When we step out, step out, step out
