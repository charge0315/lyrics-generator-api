Well, I crossed the river
Fell into the sea
Where the nonbelievers
Go beyond belief
Then I scratched the surface
In the mouth of Hell
Runnin' out of service
In the blood, I fell

Well, I, I just wanna see the light
And I, I don't wanna lose my sight
Well, I, I just wanna see the light
And I need to know what's worth the fight

Well, I've been wasted
Pills and alcohol
And I've been chasin'
Down the pool halls
Then I drank the water
From a hurricane
And I set a fire
Just to see the flame

Well, I, I just wanna see the light
And I, I don't wanna lose my sight
Well, I, I just wanna see the light
And I need to know what's worth the fight

Well, I crossed the desert
Reachin' higher ground
Then I pound the pavement
To take the liars down
But it's gone forever
Never too late
Where the ever after
Is in the hands of fate

Well, I, I just wanna see the light
And I, I don't wanna lose my sight
Well, I, I just wanna see the light
And I need to know what's worth the fight
