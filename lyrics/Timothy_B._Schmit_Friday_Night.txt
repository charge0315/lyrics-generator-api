Schmit
Hold on, let's end this conversation
We need to take a break and I don't want to fight
I've had a minor revelation
Let's deal with it later
'Cause it's Friday night
All week, we've been working so hard
Now it's time to kick back and set our sights
We can make it pretty simple
Put it on the backburner
It's a Friday night
Feel that warm breeze floating through the window
Sure do like it this way
Something tells me this is the way to go
And I've got a few things to say
Slip into your best dress
Paint your lips red
Open up your blue eyes
Forget the things we said
I could be your lover
You can shine the light
Let's fire up the candle
It's a Friday night
Let's go look for hidden treasure
I wanna dig it up while the moon is bright
No more living under pressure
Gotta see your eyes sparkle
It's a Friday night
Roll that big world right off your shoulders
I will try to do the same
If we don't act now, we'll simply grow older
Another faded picture in a frame
Button off your blue jeans
Tumble down your hair
Take a look around
We can do it anywhere
You can be my princess
I'll be what you like
Let's run around the palace
It's a Friday night
Feel that warm breeze floating through the window
Sure do like it this way
Something tells me this is the way to go
And I've got a few words to say
Slip into your best dress
Paint your lips red
Open up your blue eyes
Forget the things we said
I could be your lover
You can shine the light
Let's burn another candle
It's a Friday night
