I can't give you anything but love, baby
That's the only thing I've plenty of, baby
Dream a while, scheme a while, you're sure to find
Happiness and I guess all those things you've always pined for

Gee, I'd like to see you looking swell, Tony
With diamond watches, Tiffany's just don't sell, baby

Until that lucky day, you know darn well
Well, I can't give you anything but love

I can't give you anything but love, lady
That's the only thing I've plenty of, lady
Dream a while, scheme a while, you're sure to find
Happiness and I guess all the things you've always pined for

How'd you like to see me looking swell, lady
Diamond bracelets, Woolworth doesn't sell, Gaga

'Til that lucky day, you know darn well, baby
Well, I can't give you anything
I don't want just anything
Oh, I can't give you anything but love (But love)
