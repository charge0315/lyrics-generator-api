Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh

If I had the moment, I'd capture that moment
You would be right here next to me
If I had the secret, the secret to your love
I would place the treasure beneath my heart

Lock it all up and throw away the key
I would never give it, it up
'Cause I was just a fool, a fool for you
When I loved you so childishly

And I want it all back
I want it all, I want it all, girl, I want it all back
I want it all back
I want it all, I want it all, girl, I want it all
You never miss a good thing 'til it's gone
I want it all, now I want it all (Back)

If there is a green light and it starts to turn yellow
Pedal to the floor 'cause I know your heart is turning red
If I had the minutes, I would turn 'em into hours
And make love to your mind and not your body instead

I was just a fool, a fool for you
That didn't know what I had until I lost you
Now every single moment that you're not here
It's evident to me that everything just seems so clear

And I want it all back (I gotta have it all, have it all back, yeah)
I want it all, I want it all, girl, I want it all back (Yeah)
I want it all back (Yeah)
I want it all, I want it all, girl, I want it all
You never miss a good thing 'til it's gone
I want it all, now I want it all (Back)

Now everything isn't everything
If everything, everything isn't with you, yeah (Wow!)

And I want it all back
I want it all, I want it all, girl, I want it all back
I want it all back (Yeah!)
I want it all, I want it all, girl, I want it all
You never miss a good thing 'til it's gone
I want it all, now I want it all (Back)

Now I want it all back
Now I want it all back
Now I want it all back
