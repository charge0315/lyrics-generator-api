Mmm, mmm
Mmm, mmm
Mmm, mmm, mmm
If you should go away, I'll hurt today
Won't you stay?
You're the one with the key to my heart
You taught me many things while living here
When we were near-ear-ear
The one with the key to my heart
Never could be (Never could be)
Someone like you to understand (To understand)
All the hurt and pain, you're my only man
My love is yours at your command
Listen, at night I think of you, how we grew
Now I'm blue-ue-ue
The one with the key to my heart
Together we shared the world, a string of pearls
I was your girl
You're the one with the key of my heart
You unlocked the door (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
To all of the things that were part of me
I hope you'll see that you made me free
Now that you're gone (Now that you're gone)
I'm all alone, you left me
You're the key
(Won't you help me, baby)
To my heart
You're the key-ey
(Ooh)
To my heart
(Baby, hey baby)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, you're a part of me
I hope you see that you made me free
Now that you're gone (Now that you're gone)
I'm all alone, you left, you left (Ooh...ooh...ooh...ooh...)
Ooh, ooh you left me alone, baby, baby
(Ooh...ooh...ooh...)
Ooh, you don't have to leave, baby, oh
Oh, ho, oh, oh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Baby, what am I gonna do so empty baby (Ooh...)
You filled my life (Ooh...)
Oh, whoa, oh, oh, baby
You're the key
To my heart
You're the key-ey
To my heart
You're the key
To my heart
You're the key-ey
To my heart
You're the key (You're the key)
To my heart (To my heart)
You're the key-ey (You're the key)
To my heart
You're the key (You're the key)
To my heart (To my heart)
You're the key-ey (You're the key)
To my heart
You leave me abandoned, baby, baby
You'll ever forgive me, baby
Will you ever forgive me, baby, ooh
You're the key (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
To my heart (Ooh, ooh)
You're the key-ey
To my heart (I'm beggin' you, baby)
You're the key
To my heart
You're the key-ey
To my heart
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh,ooh, hoo, oh, oh
Oh, whoa, oh, oh, whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, baby, baby
Where did you go, baby?
Your home is ready, baby, ah, hey-ey-ey, hey
Ooh, wee, baby, your things are still here, baby
You reminded me of all the times
Baby, when we spent together, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
