We're not indestructible
Baby, better get that straight
I think it's unbelievable
How you give into the hands of fate
Some things are worth fighting for
Some feelings never die
I'm not asking for another chance
I just wanna know why

There's no easy way out
There's no shortcut home
There's no easy way out
Giving in can't be wrong

I don't wanna pacify you
I don't wanna drag you down
But I'm feeling like a prisoner
Like a stranger in a no-name town
I see all the angry faces
Afraid that could be you and me
Talking about what might have been
Thinking about what it used to be

There's no easy way out
There's no shortcut home
There's no easy way out
Giving in can't be wrong

Baby, baby, we can shed this skin
We can know how we feel inside
Instead of going down an endless road
Not knowing if we're dead or alive
Some things are worth fighting for
Some feelings never die
I'm not asking for another chance
I just wanna know why

There's no easy way out
There's no shortcut home
There's no easy way out
Giving in, giving in can't be wrong, no
There's no easy way out (There's no easy way out)
There's no shortcut home (There's no shortcut home)
There's no easy way out, there's no easy, no easy, no easy way out
There's no easy way out (There's no easy way out)
There's no shortcut home (There's no shortcut home)
There's no easy way out, there's no easy, no easy, no easy way out
There's no easy way out
There's no shortcut home
There's no easy way out
