I've been down this road before, I know it very well
And I just can't believe I've been struck
I didn't see it comin', I was blindfolded
I'm caught up in collision, and now I'm so done
You crept up like a spider, I got caught in your web
And there was no way to escape
I tried to switch my lanes, but then I hit my brakes
Sparks turned into flames

I shoulda stopped at the red light 'cause
Now I'm like a deer caught in headlights, uh
He hit me with his love, lo-love, lo-love, love
He hit me with his love and now I'm in
Love, lo-love, love, got me caught in a wreck, I'm a mess
Got me caught in a wreck, I'm a mess
Got me caught in a wreck
Somebody call the paramedics 'cause
He hit me with his love, lo-love, lo-love, love

I was creepin' up the road, just knew I had control
So how did I end up gettin' hit?
I had on my belt, I checked it myself
So how in the world did I get caught?
I had the right of way, huh, hey
I saw the sign you disobeyed (It's your fault)
I can't believe the way you would badger my heart
I think I should sue ya

I shoulda stopped at the red light 'cause
Now I'm like a deer caught in headlights, uh
He hit me with his love, lo-love, lo-love, love
He hit me with his love and now I'm in
Love, lo-love, love, got me caught in a wreck, I'm a mess
Got me caught in a wreck, I'm a mess
Got me caught in a wreck
Somebody call the paramedics 'cause
He hit me with his love, lo-love, lo-love, love

You caught me by surprise, I can't believe that I'm
Falling for this guy
Somebody call the cops 'cause I'm
Falling for that guy, guy
Y-Y-You caught me by surprise, I can't believe that I'm
Falling for this guy
Somebody call the cops 'cause I'm
Falling for that guy, guy

I shoulda stopped at the red light 'cause
Now I'm like a deer caught in headlights, uh
He hit me with his love, lo-love, lo-love, love
He hit me with his love and now I'm in
Love, lo-love, love, got me caught in a wreck, I'm a mess
Got me caught in a wreck, I'm a mess
Got me caught in a wreck
Somebody call the paramedics 'cause
He hit me with his love, lo-love, lo-love, love

He crashed into my heart (Love)
He crashed into my heart (Love)
Somebody call the paramedics 'cause
He hit me with his love
He crashed into my heart (Love)
He crashed into my heart (Love)
Somebody call the paramedics 'cause
He hit me with his love, lo-love, lo-love, love
