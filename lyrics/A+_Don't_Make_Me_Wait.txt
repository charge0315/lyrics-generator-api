Uh, yes yes y'all
Something you can touch y'all, check it out
Yes, yes y'all
Yes yes, y'all, -es y'all
Yes, yes y'all
Uh huh, uh huh
Yes, yes y'all
(Don't make me wait)
Dig it

You know the deal and I do too
Player haters telling you that I lied to you
And nobody does it like me
So maybe if you right for me, you could be wifey
You're made of Long Island, they hate to see you smile
And plus the profile, and you know my style
Tell me why your friends are saying this should wait a while
They all scheming kinda blocking and double-teaming
I know the deal-y cuz they all don't really wanna
See you happy coming through in a Red Hummer
Still your hands in the air when you see me
And while you at it, you copped the CD singing:

Don't make me wait another night
Tonight I'm going to love you
Don't make me wait all night
Because I can do it right, yes I can

What's the big idea? Been waiting all year
Trying to get a player to pay to do your hair
Get your nails airbrushed plus designed
You need to ride that pony like Ginuwine
First, you wanna come then you change your mind
You want me on the guest list, waiting in line
Plus you're getting in free with your VIP
So tell  that A wanna rumble with the
We could see who the cheesy rat
You fascinated by cars and the keys and that?
Been a long time coming, it's a quarter to 8
So tell me why you making me wait
Huh?

Oh, I desire you
You're truly fantasy
Oh, I gotta have you
Yes, body and soul

Yo, since the last joint you've been holding out
And all I can see is that I'm holding out
Tryna take it there and tear your back out
And every time I come close, you're backing out
If it takes two to make a thing go right
You could  tomorrow but tonight
I'm tryna make it happen and I hate to sound pushy
I like you a lot but I really want the gold
Very disrespectful, leaving me on hold
Winter's around the corner and it's getting kinda cold
Plus you're giving me a standing A
So tell me why you're really making me wait
Huh, sugar?
