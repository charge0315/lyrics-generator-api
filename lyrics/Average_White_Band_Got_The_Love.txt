(Got the love, got the love)
(Got the love, got the love)
(Got the love, got the love)
(Got the love, got the love)
Babe, you been gone such a long time
Been thinkin' 'bout what it is we've got
Not all the time in the world, wooh but we got a lot
There's much more than a ghost of a chance
We can make it right this time
'Cause you've got to stay mine
I got the love
(Got the love, got the love)
Got to make it work on you
(Got the love, got the love)
Oh, got the love
(Got the love, got the love)
And I just can't keep it hid
(Got the love, got the love)
Now you might not think that I care at all, but I do
You know me so much better than anyone else
It should be easy to convince you that I got the love
Oh I got the love
Woah oh oh oh
(You'd better listen to what he's sayin')
('Cause it's true)
I got the love
(Got the love, got the love)
And I got to make it work on you
(Got the love, got the love)
I got the love
(Got the love, got the love)
And I just can't keep it hid
(Got the love, got the love)
Now come on girl, let's work it out
'Cause I know we can
Let's make it something to shout about
Come on and take my hand
'Cause I got the love
(Got the love, got the love)
And I got to make it work on you
(Got the love, got the love)
I got the love
(Got the love, got the love)
And I just can't keep it hid
(Got the love, got the love)
(Got the love, got the love)
