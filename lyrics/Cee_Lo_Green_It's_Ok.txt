Well I wandered around after our war of words
And I've waited in vain here for weeks
The ghost of a girlfriend that's here in my room
I still smell her perfume in my sheets
But that's not her in my bed, no she's out on the town
And I don't want anyone to see
There's a tattoo of my name on her body but obviously
The man holding her hand isn't me

Oh honey how could you regret me when you can't even forget me

Babe it's okay, to say that you love me
I think of you (all night long) still think of you (all night long)
Ohh it's okay say that you love me! (love me)
I think of you (all night long) still thinkin of you (all night long)

I thought that once you had one, you'd had every woman
Until I lost this legendary woman
(Shit) Now I'm sure
That they don't make 'em like her anymore
So PLEASE~! baby, PLEASE~! lover
Let's find a way to forgive each other
I've gotten around ever since you've been gone
But without you I'm still alone

Ohh how can you regret me when you know you can't forget me

Babe it's okay, to say that you love me
I think of you (all night long) still think of you (all night long)
Ohh it's okay! Say that you love me! (love me)
I think of you (all night long) still thinkin of you (all night long)

I make mistakes, I'm only human
And I am not ashamed to say
That you, are, the one

Babe it's okay, to say that you love me
I think of you (all night long) still think of you (all night long)
But it's okay! To say that you love me! (Love me)
I think of you (all night long) still thinkin of you (all night long)
Oh, it's okay (Ok love me)
Say that you love me

Oooooooooooooooh
Say you love me
