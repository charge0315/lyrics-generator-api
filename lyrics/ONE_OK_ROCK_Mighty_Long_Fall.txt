When we met
The pain stood still, it was us
Then suddenly, it's "where'd you go?"
The system blew, I knew

This side of me, I want a little more (Little more)
But inside, it seems I'm just a little boy
Nothing else

Don't go, it's a mighty long fall
When you thought love was the top (Woah)
Oh, no, it's a wake-up call
When your life went into shock (Woah, woah)
It seems like gravity keeps pulling us back down (Woah)
Don't go, it's a mighty long fall
When you know time is up (Woah, woah; ah-woo)

When we said
These lies for love, it was us

This side of you, show me a little more
But in timе, I'll see, you're just a little score
So down with it, down wе go

Don't go, it's a mighty long fall
When you thought love was the top (Woah)
Oh, no, it's a wake-up call
When your life went into shock (Woah, woah)
It seems like gravity keeps pulling us back down (Woah)
Don't go, it's a mighty long fall
When you know time is up, time is up (Woah, woah)

Woah, oh
Woah, oh
Woah, oh
Woah, oh

Get up, get up, get up, get up
Time to make amends for what you did
Get up, get up, get up, get up
Running with your demons in your head
Let's shout it out completely
Never really wanna know
Let's shout it out, we're screamin', oh

(Oh, oh)
(Oh, oh)

Don't go, it's a mighty long fall
When you thought love was the top (Woah)
Oh, no, it's a wake-up call
When your life went into shock (Woah, woah)
It seems like gravity keeps pulling us back down (Woah)
Don't go, it's a mighty long fall
When you know time is up (Woah, woah)

Don't go (Oh)
D-D-D-D-Don't go (Oh)
D-D-D-D-Don't go (Oh)
Don't go (Oh)
(Oh, oh, uh)
