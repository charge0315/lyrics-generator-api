Ooh, I been dirt
And I don't care
Ooh, I been dirt
And I don't care

'Cause I'm burning inside
I'm just a-yearning inside
And I'm the fire of life

Yeah, alright

Ooh, I've been hurt
And I don't care
Ooh, I've been hurt
And I don't care

'Cause I'm burning inside
I'm just a-dreaming this life

And do you feel it?
Said do you feel it when you touch me?
Said do you feel it when you touch me?
There's a fire
Well, it's a fire

Yeah, alright
Ooh

Play it for me, babe
With love

I was just a little burning inside
I was just a little burning
Just a-dreaming
Just a-dreaming
I was just a-dreaming
I was just a-dreaming

And do you feel it?
Said do you feel it when you touch me?
Said do you feel it when you cut me?
Well, there's a fire
Well, there's a fire

Just a-dreaming
Just a-dreaming
Just a-dreaming
Just a-dreaming
Just a-dreaming
