I know a place built like a bongo drum
When you're inside, you're sure to have some fun
One, two, three and you will be on the move
Gaiety and laughter will put you in the groove
Just let yourself go you can be the show
No finer feeling can be yours I know
So come on lets all go and it will be no sin
To be mamboing down there at the Mambo Inn
