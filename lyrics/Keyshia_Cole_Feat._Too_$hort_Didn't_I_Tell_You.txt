'Ey Keyshia, it's your big homey $hort Dog from the town
I know you big ballin', baby
But I don't wanna get no phone calls, talkin 'bout
"Keyshia at the house, curled up cryin; with her heart broke"
Know you wahn't raised like that! (Ay)
You need to hit a club or somethin' (Ay)
Goin' out (AY!!)
Keyshia

So while you goin' out, havin yo' fun
I should sit here, waitin' for you?
All this time I've invested in you, baby
Now you gettin yo' dubs and
Makin yo' runs and, poppin yo' drank and
Havin yo' fun
But see, it's okay
'Cause what goes around, comes around
It's always been that way, yeah

Didn't I tell you I was gonna be the one? (Be the one)
Be the one, and when it's all done, boy
(She can't love you like I do)
Didn't I tell you, boy? (Huh?)
Didn't I tell you? (Huh?)
Didn't I tell you? (Huh?)
Didn't I tell you? (Huh?)
Didn't I tell you, boy?

So now the sun comin' up, you wanna change
But I ain't sittin' up and cryin' and shit
So while you rollin' out, doin yo' thang
I be poppin' my, bottles
Rollin my dubs, hangin wit my girls
I be havin my fun
'Cause I don't deserve, all the games you play
Now you comin back this way-ay, but...

Didn't I tell you I was gonna be the one? (Be the one)
Be the one, and when it's all done, boy

You goin out knowin' everybody's watchin' (You can't play her)
But she can never be me and you know it, baby (She play the game)
The truth is in the puddin, ain't no way to hide it
Didn't I tell you, boy? (I know she told you)

You think you got her stuck? You must be smokin'
She got a lotta money too, she ain't no joke, man
We raised her good, she got the game before the fame
Keyshia Cole, ain't nuttin' changed, you know her name
You see her ridin' somethin' clean, lookin hella fly
I know you heard she "Changed Her Mind", I'm 'bout to tell you why
She ain't stayin at the house, she's goin out
To some exclusive shit, that you don't know about
Keyshia won't be curled up, cryin' wit her broke heart
She 'bout to get dressed and go hard
And if you wanna run the streets, chasin' hoes, dude
She'll be out chillin, 'cause you ain't doin what you s'posed to

Didn't I tell you I was gonna be the one? (Be the one)
Be the one, and when it's all done, boy
(She can't love you like I do)
Didn't I tell you, boy? (Yeah yeah yeah yeah)
Didn't I tell you? (Huh?) (Yeah yeah yeah yeah)
Didn't I tell you? (Huh?) (Yeah yeah yeah yeah)
