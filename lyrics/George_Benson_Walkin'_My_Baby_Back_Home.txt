Gee, it's great after being out late
Walking my baby back home
Arm in arm over meadow and farm
Walking my baby back home

We go along harmonizing a song
Or I'm reciting a poem
Owls go by and they give me the eye
Walking my baby back home

We stop for a while, she gives me a smile
And snuggles her head to my chest
We start in to pet, and that's when I get
Her powder all over my vest

After I kind of straighten my tie
She has to borrow my comb
One kiss then I continue again
Walking my baby back home

She's afraid of the dark
So I had to park outside of her door till it's light
She says if I try to kiss her she'd cry
I dry her tears all through the night

Hand in hand to a barbecue stand
Right from her doorway we roam
Eat and then it's a pleasure again
Walking my baby, talking my baby
Lovin' my baby, I don't mean maybe
Walking my baby back home
