We once had things in common
Now, the only thing we share is the refrigerator
Ice cold, baby, I told you, I'm ice cold (Ice cold)
You out here flyin' high (
High
)
Huh, go 'head, fly that thing
High, high, yeah
But fly alone

You always smokin' in the house
What if my mother comes over?
You can't get up and get a job
'Cause this little hustle's gettin' you by
You're the dealer and the stoner
With the sweetest kiss I've ever known

I know what I was on
I had a Pilot Jones (What you know about her?)
She took me high (Oh, did she now?)
Then she took me home (We talkin' 'bout)
Pilot Jones, Pilot Jones

Tonight, she came stumblin' across my lawn again
I just don't know why I keep on tryna keep a grown woman sober
See, there you go reachin' up your blouse
And no, I don't want a child
But I ain't been touched in a while
By the dealer and the stoner
With the sweetest kiss I've ever known

I know what I was on (Ever known,
we'll fly, fly
)
I had a Pilot Jones (
We'll fly, fly, fly,
 what you know about her?)
She took me high (
We'll be here flyin',
 oh, did she now?)
Then she took me home (
Oh,
 we talkin' 'bout)
Pilot Jones, Pilot Jones

In the sky up above, the birds
I saw the sky like I've never seen before, yeah
Thought I was above you
Above this in so many ways
But if I got a condo on a cloud
Then I guess you can stay at my place
Boo-hoo, I'ma get one
Mm-hmm, I need ya
I admit it, you're my Pilot Jones
