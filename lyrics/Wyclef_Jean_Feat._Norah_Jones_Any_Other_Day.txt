Hmmmmmmmm... mmmmmmm
Today is, not like, any other day
This one is running, turn a darker shade of grey
What, will, I, have, left (tell me tell me)
(Somebody tell me now)
When, this, hard, rain's, gone away
There is a safe place, that I used to know-hohhhh
It's the only place, that I want to go
Where, else, could, I (tell me tell me)
(Somebody tell me now)
'Til, this, hard, rain's, gone (ah-ah-away)

Grandma, grandpa, mother, father
Sister, brother, Lord
Please help the child
I heard the preacher say it's okay, I heard the preacher say
I see the airplane
I hear the engine on the boat
But y'all can't see me waving the flag
Somebody please wave the flag

What, will, I, have, left (tell me tell me)
(Somebody tell me now)
When, this, hard, rain's, gone away
Today is, not like, any other day
So I'm gone, I have to find, my own way
(People, we gotta find another way!)
Can, you, tell, me, how
When, the, hard, rain's, gone (ah-ah-away)

I see them waving the flag
Tell the chopper over here man we waving the flag
I see them waving the flag
Tell the boat over here man we waving the flag
Man I'm waving the flag
Tell the chopper over here man we waving the flag
Man I'm waving the flag
Tell the boat over here man we waving the flag, waving the flag, waving the flag
