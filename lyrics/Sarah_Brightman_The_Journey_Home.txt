The journey home is never too long
Your heart arrives before the train
The journey home is never too long
Some yesterdays always remain
I'm going back to where my heart was light
When my pillow was a ship, I sailed through the night

The journey home is never too long
When open arms are waiting there
The journey home is never too long
There's room to love and room to spare
I want to feel the way that I did there
And think my wishes through before I wish again

Not every boat you come across is one you have to take
Now sometimes standing still can be the best move you ever make

The journey home is never too long
Home hopes to heal the deepest pain
The journey home is never too long
Your heart arrives before the train
