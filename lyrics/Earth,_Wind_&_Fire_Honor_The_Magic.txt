Hold on to your spirit, always feel your soul
Honor the magic, yeah, in your heart
As a family we're a part of everlasting hope
Bringing the magic, ohh, that tender love
Ah, ohh-oh, honor the magic
Ah, ohh-oh, honor the magic
Yeah, that tender love
Hold on to your spirit, always feel your soul
Honor the magic, yeah, in your heart
As a family we're a part of everlasting hope
Bringing the magic, giving that tender love
(Repeat x2)
Ah, ohh, honor the magic en tu corazon
Ah, ohh, honor the magic
Yeah, that tender love
Through the ups and downs
You've got to hold on to your spirits
Always feel the love and joy is everlasting
Hearts so tender
Love surrender
Our hearts are filled with joy and laughter
