Don't let it get you, don't let it get you down
For this fine old world keeps on spinning 'round

That's life
That's what all the people say
You're riding high in April
You're shot down in May
I know I'm gonna change that tune
When I'm back on top, mmm,  in June
I say that's life
And as funny as it may seem
Some people get their kicks
Stompin' on your dreams
But I don't let it, let it get me down
'Cause this fine ol' world keeps spinning 'round

I've been a puppet, a pauper, a pirate
A poet, a pawn and a king
I've been up and down and over and out
But I know one thing
Each time I find myself, a-flat on this face
I pick myself up and get back in the race

That's life That's life
I can't deny it
I thought of quitting, baby Oh, yeah, quitting, baby
This heart wasn't gonna buy it
And if I didn't think it was worth one single try One single try
I'd jump right on a big bird, and then I'd fly Then I'd fly

I've been a puppet, a pauper, a pirate
A poet, a pawn and a king
I've been up and down and over and out
And I know one thing
Each time I find myself, flat on my face
I pick myself up, and get back in the race Back in the race

That's life That's life
That's life and I can't deny it Deny it
Many times I thought of cutting out
But my heart won't buy it
But if there's nothing shakin' come this here July Come here July
I'm gonna roll He's gonna roll
I'm gonna roll
I'm gonna roll myself up in a big ball and die
I can't deny it
That's life
