Ain't no lightnin' and there ain't no thunder
Not a single drop of rain come down
Might be blue skies that I'm under
But I'm bein' followed by a small dark cloud
Ain't no lightnin' and there ain't no thunder
Not a single drop of rain come down
Might be blue skies that I'm under
But I'm bein' followed by a small dark cloud
Ain't no lightnin' and there ain't no thunder
Not a single drop of rain come down
Might be blue skies that I'm under
But I'm bein' followed by a small dark cloud
Get up in the mornin'
Just like I used to
Just like I used to
I go through the day
Take off at lunchtime
Walk down to the corner
Walk down to the corner
And each step of the way
I think you'll be there
Every time I turn around
The only thing that's following me
Is a small dark cloud
Go home in the evenin'
Sit down at the table
Sit down at the table
And pretend you're not gone
Halfway through the nighttime
I lie down in the darkness
I lie down in the darkness
And I feel so alone
I think I see you
Every time I turn around
But the only thing that's followin' me
Is a small dark cloud
Is a small dark cloud
Well, I just wanna hold you close
And I don't wanna hold you to blame
And I don't mind the small dark cloud
If you would walk with me in the rain
If you would walk with me in the rain
Whoah, girl
I think I see you, baby
Every time I turn around
The only thing that's followin' me
Is a small dark cloud
I think I see you
Every time I turn around
The only thing that's followin' me
Is a small dark
Is a small dark (is a small dark cloud)
Ain't no lightnin' and there ain't no thunder
Not a single drop of rain come down
Might be blue skies that I'm under
But I'm bein' followed by a small dark cloud
Ain't no lightnin' and there ain't no thunder
Not a single drop of rain come down
Might be blue skies that I'm under
But I'm bein' followed by a small dark cloud
Ain't no lightnin' and there ain't no thunder
Not a single drop of rain come down
Might be blue skies that I'm under
But I'm bein' followed by a small dark cloud
Ain't no lightnin' and there ain't no thunder
Not a single drop of rain come down
Might be blue skies that I'm under
But I'm bein' followed by a small dark cloud
Ain't no lightnin' and there ain't no thunder
Not a single drop of rain come down
Might be blue skies that I'm under
But I'm bein' followed by a small dark cloud
