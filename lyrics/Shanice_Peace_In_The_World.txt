From the North to the South
From the East to the West
We're praying all over
This beautiful planet
For peace in the world
Peace
Check this out

Looking in my heart
I got to find a way
I wanna do my part
I wanna make that change
There's fighting in the streets
What's it all about?
Can we stop the hate
Can we work it out

(Say cuz')
You and I can make the difference
The love that we're feeling
I truly believe in
(Say cuz')
You and I can make a change
Love will show us how
Love will be our guide

Peace in the world
Is what we care for
Hand and hand
We'll make a change
Peace in the world
Is what we care for
Heart to heart
We'll find a way
Yeah, we're gonna make that change
Listen

Kids are starving now
All across the world
Let's lend a helping hand
Save all the boys and girls
People are selling drugs
Gangs are everywhere
Let's come together now
Show them that we care

Peace in the world
So kids'll know
Not to ever make war
Love'll show that
It can overpower hate
As evil disintegrates
'Cause we got to have faith
If you do right
There'll be no wrong
That's why
Shanice is singing the song
About love and joy
Every man, woman, boy and girl
To have peace in the world
