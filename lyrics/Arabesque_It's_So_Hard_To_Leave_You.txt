Babe
Babe, babe I still love you so
Baby I love you
Babe, babe but I have to go
There's some one else who means much more to me
Althoght my heart is not free
Babe
Babe, babe I still love you so
Baby I love you
Babe, babe but I have to go
He kisses me but you're still on my mind
Baby, so set me free 'cause I find:
It's so hard to leave you
It's so hard to grieve you
But I've found a new love
I never wanted to
I only wanted you
It's so hard to leave you
It's so hard to grieve you
But it's really true, love
I hate to make you cry
I'm here to say goodbye
Bye, bye, goodbye
Bye, bye, goodbye
Babe
Babe, babe I still love you so
Baby I love you
Babe, babe but I have to go
You always told me, it's all in the game
But for you tears I am to blame, oh
Babe
Babe, babe I still love you so
Bab I love you
Babe, babe but I have to go
But leaving you means to me much more
Much more than only closing a door
It's so hard to leave you
It's so hard to grieve you
But I've found a new love
I never wanted to
I only wanted you
It's so hard to leave you
It's so hard to grieve you
But it's really true, love
I hate to make you cry
I'm here to say goodbye
I hate to make you cry
I'm here to say goodbye
It's so hard to leave you
It's so hard to grieve you
But I've found a new love
I never wanted to
I only wanted you
It's so hard to leave you
It's so hard to grieve you
But it's really true, love
I hate to make you cry
I'm here to say goodbye
