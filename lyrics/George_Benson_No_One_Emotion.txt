You take me through so many moods
Midnight excitement to the quiet interludes
And just when I think I've got a clue
I see something new that I have never seen in you
With your eyes you ask what´s in my heart
You wonder why I love you
I don't know where to start
'Cause no one emotion could ever reveal
All the things that I feel
No one emotion would ever do
No one emotion could ever describe
'Cause there's too many here inside
I wish I knew the one thing it was
It's more like a thousand things
That all add up to love
Sometimes I look when you don't see
And a wave of affection comes a-washing over me
With your eyes you ask what's in my heart
You wonder why I love you
I don't know where to start
No one emotion could ever reveal
All the things that I feel
No one emotion would ever do
No one emotion could ever describe
All the feelings inside
No one emotion would be enough
I might as well try to paint with just one stroke
Or try to write a love song with just a single note
'Cause no one emotion could ever reveal
All the things that I feel
No one emotion would ever do
No one emotion could ever describe all the feelings inside
No one emotion would be enough
