When I'm all alone
Just getting in the zone
We talked about it all night
It's all right boy
Tell me if you want it or not
Just take it nice and slow
Enough to let this thing go
There's nothing left to do now
It's all right boy
Just tell me if I'm on the right spot
Go go go
Get my body on the floor
Put my back against the wall
You know just what to do
I just want to know
Am I just for show
It seems it's like a dream now
It's all right boy
Just tell me what's this all about
Been around the world
Time and time before
Will it be me and you now
I'm on a ride
Something I just gotta find out
Go go go
Get my body on the floor
Put my back against the wall
You know just what to do
Don't worry baby, just touch me baby
Go go go
Get my body on the floor
Put my back against the wall
You know just what to do
