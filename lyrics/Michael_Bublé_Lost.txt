I can't believe it's over
I watched the whole thing fall
And I never saw the writing that was on the wall
If I'd only knew
The days were slipping past
That the good things never last
That you were crying
Mmm-mm

Summer turned to winter
And the snow, it turned to rain
And the rain turned into tears upon your face
I hardly recognize the girl you are today
And God, I hope it's not too late
Mmm, it's not too late

'Cause you are not alone
I'm always there with you
And we'll get lost together
'Til the light comes pouring through
'Cause when you feel like you're done
And the darkness has won
Babe, you're not lost
When your world's crashing down
And you can't bear the thought
I said, babe, you're not lost

Life can show no mercy
It can tear your soul apart
It can make you feel like you've gone crazy
But you're not
When things have seemed to change
There's one thing that's still the same
In my heart, you have remained
And we can fly, fly, fly away

'Cause you are not alone
And I am there with you
And we'll get lost together
'Til the light comes pouring through
'Cause when you feel like you're done
And the darkness has won
And babe, you're not lost
When the world's crashing down
And you can not bear the cross
I said, baby, you're not lost

Mmm, yeah, yeah-yeah
I said, baby, you're not lost
I said, baby, you're not lost
Oh, yeah-yeah
I said, baby, you're not lost
