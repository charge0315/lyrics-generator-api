You can be light years
Away fom a serious intention
See I thought I'd change it all
Someday
I'd get to turn mankind this day
If you don't know you can be light years
Away from your true destination
Until I get with good vibration
I'm never gonna get to use this earthly power
But I'm gonna jump back
Stand back and use that earthly power
Now I got that sunshine in my life
Light years half a million miles from what you wanna be
Did you ever hear about the man who tried to be
Truly free truly free
You know what I mean
Light years will stand between the laws of principle
And now we think we are invincible
But without true power it's unthinkable
Light years away from the colour of our brotherhood
Light years away from our duty to assistance
