I used to sit and wonder
Would I ever be happy?
Life was so bitter sweet
So many disappointments
Too many ups and downs for me
When you live a nightmare, it's hard to dream

But sometimes life just isn't fair
So why complain nobody cares?
And I don't wanna waste nobody's time
So I'm

I'm 'bout to change my vibe
Today the Sun's gon' shine
'Cause I made up my mind
That today will be the start of better days
Leaving old shit behind
And move on with my life
The blindfold's off my eyes
And now all I see for me is better days

(One, three)
Afraid of my reflection
Tell me that's not me I see
That's who I wanna be
Stuck somewhere in the middle
On half full or half empty
Waiting for somebody to come and rescue me

Can't let that petty attitude
Start to jade my point of view
Only thing that does is bring me down
So I'm

I'm 'bout to change my vibe
Today the Sun's gon' shine
'Cause I made up my mind
That today will be the start of better days
Leaving old shit behind
And move on with my life
The blindfold's off my eyes
And now all I see for me is better days

Hurt so many times before
I used to cry but no more
Just let it go and life can feel so good
Stop living the blues
Can't let this petty attitude
Start to jade my point of view
The only thing it does is bring me down
So I'm

I'm 'bout to change my vibe
Today the Sun's gon' shine
'Cause I made up my mind
That today will be the start of better days
Leaving old shit behind
And move on with my life
The blindfold's off my eyes
And now all I see for me is better days
(Day, yeah) I'm 'bout to change my vibe
(Better day, yeah) Today the Sun's gon' shine
(Better day) 'Cause I made up my mind
(Day, yeah) That today will be the start of better days
(Day, yeah) Leaving old shit behind
(Better days, yeah) To move on with my life
(Better) The blindfold's off my eyes
And now all I see for me is better days
(Better) I'm 'bout to change my vibe
(Day, yeah) Today the Sun's gon' shine
(Better) 'Cause I made up my mind
(Day, yeah) That today will be the start of better days
(Better) Leaving old shit behind
(Day, yeah) And move on with my life
(Better) The blindfold's off my eyes
And now all I see for me
