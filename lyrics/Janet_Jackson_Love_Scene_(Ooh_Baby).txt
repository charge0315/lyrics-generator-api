Ooh, baby, ooh, baby
Ooh, baby, ooh, baby
Ooh, baby, ooh, baby
Ooh, baby, ooh, baby

Lying here, I imagine you with me
On this rainy night
I feel your touch as your hands move slowly
Up my thighs
You taste the honey, then begin to pour it slowly
Wherever you desire
To feel you play with my body this way
Makes me say

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, baby (Ooh, baby, ooh, baby)
Ooh, baby (Ooh, baby, ooh, baby)
When you're close to me (Ooh, baby, ooh, baby)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh (Ooh, baby, ooh, baby)

Whispered words, fantasies in my ear
You know this I like
Just tell me how, when, and where you want me and
I'll be there

Ooh, baby (Ooh, baby, ooh, baby)
Ooh, baby, ooh, baby
When you're holding me (Ooh, baby, ooh, baby)
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah (Ooh, baby, ooh, baby)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, baby (Ooh, baby, ooh, baby)
Ooh, ooh, baby (Ooh, baby, ooh, baby)
When you're loving me (Ooh, baby, ooh, baby)
When you're fucking me (Ooh, baby, ooh, baby)

Ooh, baby, ooh, baby
Ooh, baby, ooh, baby
Ooh, baby, ooh, baby
Ooh, baby, ooh, baby
