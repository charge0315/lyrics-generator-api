Something new
You know what we gotta do
Let's have it all
I see the way you're looking at me
Oh I love the way
Your lips say my name
I'll never be the same
Baby you can just count on me then
Every time I'm wanting more
Every time I know
Tell me baby now
Oh yeah
Don't care who you used to be
Enough of that
Come with me I'll show ya
Things you only dreamed of
Your mouths made to kiss me
Kissin' my lips
Kissin' my heart
Can't get enough
There is no need to be afraid
Everybody bе saying slow down
Just take my hand and speed up
No need to look back
Can you hear me
Lеt me know your secrets
Feel excitement in the air?
Well girl I feel it too
It's under over inside and out
No way that I'm hiding from you
All my friends are jealous of
The way that you move your body
Baby I know just what they mean
Now you can barely believe
Hearts pounding fast
We're just getting started
Bright lights, city's all ours
Your eyes are saying
Kiss me girl
Kissin' my lips
Kissin' my heart
Can't get enough
There is no need to be afraid
Everybody be saying slow down
Just take my hand and speed up
No need to look back
Can you hear me
Let me know your secrets
The nights get lonely oh yeah
But those nights are over, you're safe, oh yeah
I'm right here for you
So take my hand babe
Turn off the breaks
Cruisin' the city
Nothing to worry 'bout as long as you with me
Higher we go we can't see the floor
But one day not far
We're going straight to mars
Yeah it's our time
No left it feels right
Two people find the time to combine
One of a kind play no rewind
Feeling of your lips on mine
Nothings out of our reach
(Oh yeah)
(Baby you can just count on me then)
Kissin' my lips
Kissin' my heart
Can't get enough
There is no need to be afraid
Everybody be saying slow down
Just take my hand and speed up
No need to look back
Can you hear me
Let me know your secrets
Oh I know you gonna love it
Baby you know that I've got it
Tell me what you want
Oh I know you gonna love it
Baby you know that I've got it
Let me know your secrets
