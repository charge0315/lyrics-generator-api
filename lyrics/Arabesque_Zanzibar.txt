If you need a little rest
I advise you for the best
Take a plane and be my guest
Zanzibar (Zanzibar)
Zanzibar (Zanzibar)
Is not far
We will be alone
There will be no telephone
I will make you feel at home

Hey come to Zanzibar
Lovely Zanzibar
If you know you will find
What you have in your mind
On Zanzibar
Tell on-one where you are
And it's not too far
I'll be waiting for you on Zanzibar
Zanzibar
On my island in the sun
People walk they do not run
But they have a lot of fun

Baby you will stay
Or come back some other day
You will love it anyway
