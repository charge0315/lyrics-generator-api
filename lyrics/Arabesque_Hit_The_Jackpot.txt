Love is a game, you must play it right
You only can win of you really fight
Baby, baby, that's what you've been telling me
I started playing as you told me how
So don't complain because you're losing now
Baby, baby, that's what you've been telling me
Baby, baby, play
Till you hit the jackpot
I happen to win the jackpot
And love is such a wonderful game
The first time I play there's the jackpot
The best you can get, the jackpot
Baby, honey, that's what you are to me
It's so exciting, it takes the cake
Rien ne va plus and your heart's at stake
Baby, baby, we will play it every day
I lose my heart but I'm not gonna cry
Tomorrow we'll give it another try
Baby, baby, we will play it everyday
Baby, baby, play
Baby, baby, you hit the jackpot
Baby, baby, you hit the jackpot
Baby, baby, you hit the jackpot
Till you hit the jackpot
I happen to win the jackpot
And love is such a wonderful game
The first time I play there's the jackpot
The best you can get, the jackpot
Baby, honey, that's what you are to me
