Some days we get a thrill in our brains
Some days it turns into malaise
You see your face in the veneer
Reflected on the surface of fear
Because we know we're never better than that
Some days were worse than you can imagine
And how I'm supposed to live with that?
With all these trainwrecks coming at random

Hey, what are you gonna do
When those walls are falling down?
Falling down on you
Hey, what are you going to do
When those walls are falling down?
Falling down on you

You got warheads stacked in the kitchen
You treat distraction like it's a religion
With a rattlesnake step in your rhythm
We do the best with the souls we've been given
Because you know we're nothing special to them
We're going some place they've already been
Tryin' to make sense of what they call wisdom
And this riff-raff ain't laughing with them

Hey, what are you gonna do
When those walls are falling down?
Falling down on you
Hey, what are you going to do
When those walls are falling down?
Falling down on you

You're wearin' all of the years on your face
You have a tombstone you mourn in the place
And your heart only speaks in a murmur
But your words ringin' out just like murder
