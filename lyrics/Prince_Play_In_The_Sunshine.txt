Oooh, doggies!
Ow!
Oh! Oh! Oh!

We wanna play in the sunshine
We wanna be free
Without the help of a margarita or ecstasy
We wanna kick like we used to
Sign up on the dotted line
We're gonna dance every dance like it's gonna be the last time
We got to play in the sunshine
Turn all the lights up to ten
I wanna meet you (Meet you) and kiss you (Kiss you)
Love you (Love you) and miss you (Miss you)
Do it all over again
Do it all over again

We gonna play in the sunshine
We're gonna get over
I'm feeling kind of lucky tonight
I'm gonna find my four-leaf clover
Before my life is done
Someway, somehow
I'm gonna have fun – ow!

Play in the sunshine
Gonna love all our enemies
'Til the gorilla falls off the wall
We're gonna rock him (Rock him!)
We're gonna roll him (Roll him!)
We're gonna teach him that love will make him tall (So tall!)
Aah, pop goes the music
When the big, white rabbit begin to talk
And the color green will make your best friend leave ya
It'll make them do The Walk
But that's cool
'Cause one day, every day will be a yellow day – let's play!

We gonna play in the sunshine (Oh!)
We're gonna get over (Over)
I'm feeling kind of lucky tonight
I'm gonna find my four-leaf clover
Before my life is done (Before my life is done!)
Someway, somehow – I'm gonna have fun
Oooh!
Oww!!!!
Ooh!

PLAY!
PLAY!
PLAY!
PLAY!
PLAY! PLAY! PLAY! HO!

We gonna play in the sunshine
We're gonna get over
I'm feeling kind of lucky tonight
I'm gonna find my four-leaf clover
Before my life is done
Someway, somehow, I'm gonna have fun
Gonna play in the sunshine
I'm feeling kind of lucky tonight
I'm gonna find my four-leaf clover
Someway, somehow – I got to have fun!

PLAY! PLAY!
PLAY! No! PLAY! No! PLAY! No!
(Come on... play!) No! PLAY! No! PLAY! PLAY! PLAY! Yes!!!!
Drummer – do your thing
Drummer, drummer – do your thing
(Woo!)
Drummer, drummer, drummer... lemme play some of that – wait a minute!
Da-da-da-da-da, da-da

Let's get out of here (Yeah...)
(La-la-la-la-la-la-la... play in the sunshine)
We're not afraid to (Play in the sunshine)
We are going to
(Play in the sunshine) (Ooh)
(Play in the sunshine)
La-la-la
