You lay down
There’s a tear in your eye
You don’t wanna talk about
How you feel tonight
No, I can’t ease your mind
Or say it’s gonna be fine
Just that I’ve been there, baby
And I know what it’s like
And you’re not going back there this time
‘cause you’ve got God’s help and mine
Why don’t you reach out
And touch me in the darkness
I’ll bring you back
I’m gonna reach out
And touch you in the darkness
I’ll bring you back home
I know you’ve got a worried mind
It can take you down
It can take you out
Do you still recognize
The love that’s in my eyes?
You see, I’ve been there, baby
And I know what it’s like
And you’re not going back there this time
‘cause you’ve got God’s help and mine
Why don’t you reach out
And touch me in the darkness
I’ll bring you back
I’m gonna reach out
And touch you in the darkness
I’ll bring you back home
Oh, no one could ever know
The places that you go
When you’re alone
(Instrumental)
Oh, no one could ever know
The places that you go
When you’re alone
But you’re not alone
Why don’t you reach out
And touch me in the darkness
I’ll bring you back
I’m gonna reach out
And touch you in the darkness
I’ll bring you back home
Reach out
And touch me in the darkness
I’ll bring you back
I’m gonna reach out
And touch you in the darkness
I’ll bring you back home
