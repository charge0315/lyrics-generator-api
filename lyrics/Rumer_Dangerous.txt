Is your love too dangerous?
Is your love too dangerous?
Is your love too dangerous?
I don't want a broken heart again

Love did me wrong
Now you want me to believe
You won't hurt me
Love let me down
Now you want me to believe you're for real

You want me to let go
You want me to lose control
You want me to let go
Well, I don't wanna lose control

Is your love too dangerous?
Is your love too dangerous?
Is your love too dangerous?
I don't want a broken heart again

Too scared to trust
But it's not because of you
It's just what I've been through
Love hurt me bad (Love hurt me bad)
And I don't wanna be a fool for you

You want me to let go
You want me to lose control
You want me to let go
Well, I don't wanna lose control

Is your love too dangerous?
Is your love too dangerous?

It's taken me a long time to feel better, babe
I've only just begun to feel my heart again
And all the while I know
I don't want you to go away
I'm not afraid of you
I'm just biding my time
I'm not afraid of you

Is your love too dangerous?
Is your love too dangerous?
Is your love too dangerous?
I don't want a broken heart again
Is your love too dangerous?
Is your love too dangerous?
Is your love too dangerous?
I don't want a broken heart again
