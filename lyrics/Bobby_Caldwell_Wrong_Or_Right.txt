Now, now is the time
I make a stand for love
I will try to make you see
What it all has meant to me
There's no one above

What good is life
Here without you
Darling I swear you were all
That I needed to get through this life
Won't you hear my call

And my love
Every day and night
It will stand by you
When you are wrong or right
And although other loves may fall
Darling you are all that I need in life

Night turns into day
I sit with an empty stare
Dwelling on the memories
Of the things we used to be
Knowing you don't care

What good am I
Here without you
Darling I swear you were all
That I needed to get through this life
Won't you hear my call

And my love
Every day and night
It will stand by you
When you are wrong or right
And although other loves may fall
Darling you are all that I need in life

Can you see just what you mean to me
How could the love that was right
Come to an ending

And my love
Every day and night
It will stand by you
When you are wrong or right
And although other loves may fall
Darling you are all that I need in life
