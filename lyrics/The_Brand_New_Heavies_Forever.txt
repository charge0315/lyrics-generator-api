Forever, I will love you forever
Forever, I will love you forever, yeah
Forever, I will love you forever
Forever, yeah baby, I will love you forever
People come and people go
Acting happy just for show
Think they do but they don't know
What it is to see love grow
Living life so all alone
Hiding feelings better shown
Nothing better could I own
Than what I have with you
Forever, I will love you forever
Forever, yeah baby, I will love you forever
Far and wide I looked for you
Many nights just feeling blue
You told me that you felt it too
Before you came my way
Now I have you by my side
Nothing left for me to hide
Set to face the coming tide
What the future brings
Forever, I will love you forever
Forever, yeah baby, I will love you forever
Forever
(Need you baby, need you baby, I need you baby, right now)
I will love you forever
(Need you baby, need you baby, I need you baby, right now)
Forever
(Need you baby, need you baby, I need you baby, right now)
I will love you forever
(Need you baby, need you baby, I need you baby, right now)
Oh oh
(Need you baby, need you baby, I need you baby, right now)
My baby
(Need you baby, need you baby, I need you baby, right now)
Life goes on and on and on
People come and people go
And I want your love
I need your sweet love
(Need you baby, need you baby, I need you baby, right now)
I need it twenty four seven, three sixty five days a year
Baby
(Need you baby, need you baby, I need you baby right now)
I'm goin' get you
(Need you baby, need you baby, I need you baby right now)
Forever, forever, forever, forever, forever
