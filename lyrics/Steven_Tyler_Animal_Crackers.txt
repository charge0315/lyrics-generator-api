Don't wanna close my eyes
I don't wanna fall asleep 'cause I'd miss you, baby
And I don't wanna miss a thing

You know what I was thinkin'?
(What?)
I really don't think that the animal cracker qualifies as a cracker
(Why?)
Well, 'cause it's sweet, which to me suggests cookie, and, you know, putting cheese on something is sort of the defining characteristic... of what makes a cracker a cracker
I don't know why I thought of that. I just—
(Baby, you have such sweet pillow talk.)
I got a little animal cracker, Discovery Channel thing happenin' right here:
"Watch the gazelle, as he grazes through the open plains
Now look, as the cheetah approaches
Watch, as he stalks his prey
Now, the gazelle's a little spooked, and he could head north to the ample sustenance, provided by the mountainous peaks above
He could go south
The gazelle now faces Man's most perilous question: North, or South?
Way down under
Tune in next week
(Baby? Do you think it's possible that anyone else in the world is doing this very same thing at this very same moment?)
I hope so
Otherwise, what the hell are we tryin' to save?

Don't wanna close my eyes
I don't wanna fall asleep 'cause I'd miss you, baby
And I don't wanna miss a thing
