This is sick
Attention, it's time to dance

Work it like you're working a pole
Shake it 'til you're shaking the floor
Pop it like you're popping a cork
Don't stop, don't stop
Jerk it like you're making it choke (Like that)
Break it like you're breaking a code (Like that)
Drop it 'til you're taking it lower (Like that)
Drop it, drop it

This is serious
I'm delirious (Come on)
So oblivious
I could dance all night (With you)
As long as it's funky (Funky, funky)
This rhythm just makes me high
I'm like a junkie
I could dance all night

Work it like you're working a pole
Shake it 'til you're shaking the floor
Pop it like you're popping a cork
Don't stop, don't stop
Jerk it like you're making it choke (Like that)
Break it like you're breaking a code (Like that)
Drop it 'til you're taking it lower (Like that)
I could dance all night

(Like that)
(Like that)
(Like that)
Don't stop, don't stop

So intoxicated
I'm so stimulated
Feel so X-Rated
I could dance all night
As long as it's funky (Funky, funky)
This rhythm just makes me high
I'm like a junkie
I could dance all night

Work it like you're working a pole
Shake it 'til you're shaking the floor
Pop it like you're popping a cork
Don't stop, don't stop
Jerk it like you're making it choke (Like that)
Break it like you're breaking a code (Like that)
Drop it 'til you're taking it lower (Like that)
I could dance all night

Everybody on the floor (Let's go)
Let's get hardcore (Get low)
Make my sweat pour (Oh, no)
Don't stop (Give me some more)
Ooh, my body's yours (Spank that)
Spank that back door (Like that)
Drive me like a Porsche (Ooh, yeah)
I could dance all night
Can we take this party higher? (Come on, yeah)
Now just put your hands to the sky and (Come on, yeah)
Clap it up, clap it up
Don't stop, don't stop
I could dance all night

Work it like you're working a pole
Shake it 'til you're shaking the floor
Pop it like you're popping a cork
Don't stop, don't stop
Jerk it like you're making it choke (Like that)
Break it like you're breaking a code (Like that)
Drop it 'til you're taking it lower (Like that)
