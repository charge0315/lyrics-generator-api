This impossible power
A strength that I can't see
There's no way that I can let you go
Why did I mistake sex for another sense
Then wanted someone else to try to tell you no
Well

I think you understand
Oh that you've got it
I try hard but I can't
Oh do without it
I think you understand
That you've got it

This impossible power has broken into me
And stolen all the sense that I had before
Why did I just take and never understand
The love you've given me
Could've learnt me more

I think you understand
Oh that you've got it
I try hard but I can't
Oh do without it
I think you understand
That you've got it

What made you think
That I'd be true to you
I needed to prove it to myself
That I could let you go
What made you think
That I'd be a fool for you
You knew that I was lying
There was something I was hiding

I think you understand
That you've got it
Well I try hard but I can't
Oh do without it, ooh woo
I can't do without it, ooh woo
Wanna let you know
That I need you so, ooh woo
Oh honey come on
