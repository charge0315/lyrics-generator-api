You called me by my first name, for the first time
Since the first time, that we met
Didn't tell me goodnight, for the first time
Since the first night you laid in my bed

And it knocks me off my feet
I'm coming apart and I can't breathe
Oh, every part of me
Was tethered to what we used to be

Am I talking too much?
Am I saying enough?
Did you fall out of love?
I wish that you'd told me
What do I do?
Have I run out of time?
I'm one goodbye from lonely
I'm one goodbye from lonely
I'm one goodbye from lonely
Goodbye, goodbye lonely
Goodbye, goodbye

Something about the last kiss felt so different
Than the first kiss on my lips
I can feel the distance in between us
Like the old us doesn't exist

And it knocks me off my feet
I'm coming apart and I can't breathe
Oh, every part of me
Was tethered to what we used to be

Am I talking too much?
Am I saying enough?
Did you fall out of love?
I wish that you'd told me
What do I do?
Have I run out of time?
I'm one goodbye from lonely
I'm one goodbye from lonely
Goodbye, goodbye lonely
Goodbye, goodbye

Am I talking too much?
Am I saying enough?
Did you fall out of love?
I wish that you'd told me
What do I do?
Have I run out of time?
I'm one goodbye from lonely
Goodbye, goodbye lonely
Goodbye, goodbye
I'm one goodbye from lonely
Goodbye, goodbye lonely
Goodbye, goodbye
I'm one goodbye from lonely
I'm one goodbye from lonely
