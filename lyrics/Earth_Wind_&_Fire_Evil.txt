Evil runnin' through our brain
We and evil is about the same, mhm, mmm, mmm
Bad blood through our body flows
Where's the love, nobody knows? Oh yeah

Beauty in our face you see
Tryin' to hide all our misery

But evil runnin' through our brain
We and evil are about the same, oh yeah, baby
Ooh-hoo, ooh-hoo, yeah

Lookin' for a place to guide
Little light in our souls and minds, oh yeah, mmm
Mhm, hmm
Maybe if we learn to pray
Life would give us sunshiny days, ooh
(Sunshiny days) Ooh

And evil, it's runnin' through our brain
Turn to love and won't be the blame
