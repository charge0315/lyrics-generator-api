You held the world like a photograph
Hung up and curled, now it's torn in half
Too old, too fast, too much for you
Now what the fuck am I supposed to do
Will I get that call tomorrow
Will you throw it all away

Allie Jones
You could have had it all
Allie Jones
Your back's against the wall
Allie Jones
Your folks don't even know
Allie Jones
Don't let, don't let go
Don't let go

Can't run away, gotta play your hand
Get through the day any way you can
The hope, the pain in your daughter's eyes
I'm the only thing keeping you alive
Will I'll read it in the paper
Will you leave it all behind?

Allie Jones
You could have had it all
Allie Jones
Your back's against the wall
Allie Jones
Your folks don't even know
Allie Jones
Don't let, don't let go
Don't let go

Allie (Hold on)
Allie (Hold on)
Allie (Hold on)
Allie (Hold on)
But you don't let
But you don't let
But you don't let go
Don't let go
Don't let go
Don't let go
