Well, I drank till I stumbled, I drank till I fell
When the drunk part was over, it hurt me like hell
Now I know about drinkin', so I know one thing's true
Bein' drunk's a lot like lovin' you

'Cause I loved till I stumbled, I loved till I fell
When the lovin' was over, it hurt me like hell
Now I know what a taste of the wrong love can do
Bein' drunk's a lot like lovin' you

And I've woke up some mornin's and sworn off the drink
At that I've done reasonably well, I think
But I haven't done well swearin' off you and me
At that I've failed miserably

Well, I've felt the hangover of lovin' all night
I've sat at the bar all alone in a fight
I've bottled up feelin's and poured 'em out too
Bein' drunk's a lot like lovin' you

And I've woke up some mornin's and sworn off the drink
At that I've done reasonably well, I think
But I haven't done well swearin' off you and me
At that I've failed miserably

Well, I drank till I stumbled, I loved till I fell
When the drunk part was over, love hurt me like hell
Now I know about drinkin', so I know one thing's true
Bein' drunk's a lot like lovin' you

Though I know what a taste of the wrong love can do
Sometimes I still get drunk lovin' you
