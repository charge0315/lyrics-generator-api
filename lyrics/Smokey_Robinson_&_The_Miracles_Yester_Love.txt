Ooh-oo-oo

Yesterday, we made future plans, she loved me, I could tell
Can today be that tomorrow that we planned so well?
Yester baby, I'll never forget her
Though tomorrow might bring me one better

Today I'll go my away dreaming of my yester love
Today I'll go my away dreaming of my yester love

Yesterday, I felt a tender kiss upon my face (Tender kiss upon my face)
Now the day is gone and there's a teardrop in its place, oh (There's a teardrop in its place)
Yester kisses that I used to treasure
Now you're giving some other lips pleasure

Today I'll go my away dreaming of my yester love
Today I'll go my away dreaming of my yester love

Yester is the prefix that we fix to things that have gone by
Forever they say, yeah even though my yester love
Has slipped through my fingers, I find it still lingers
In my heart today-ay-ay

(Yesterday) Yesterday, I thought I had a love to call my own
(Yesterday) No one could have told me that today I'd be alone
Yester sweetness today has gone sour
Seemin' further away with each hour

Today I'll go my way dreamin' of my yester love
Today I'll go my way dreamin' of my yester love
Today I'll go my way dreamin' of my yester love
