Are you tired of this insanity?
Children dying in the streets
Ain't you had enough? (Ain't cha had enough)
Ain't you had enough?
We've conquered all our eyes can see
But we're still in poverty
Ain't you had enough? (Ain't cha had enough)
Ain't you had enough?
We have decided in our minds
To settle the future of mankind
We've signed on and committed to our love
Well, well, well
Every time we seem to look around
I can see the people crying out
'Cause the fear, hate and power
And that good ol' mighty dollar
Time to unite and make it right within us
Sign on
No more war, no more greed, if you agree...
Sign on
For a better way
Sign on
For the fight, do what's right, our way of life
Sign on
For a better way, start today
We're not settling with an excuse for our fellow man's abuse
Ain't you had enough? (Ain't you had enough, well)
Ain't you had enough?
We don't care what man believes, when the truth is in their deeds
Ain't you had enough? (Ain't you had enough, yeah)
Ain't you had enough?
We have decided in our minds
To settle the future of mankind
We've signed on and committed to our love
We suffer every minute, every hour
Makes the people want to holler
Leaders never follow
So this campaign is our motto
Time to unite and make it right within us
Sign on
No more war, no more greed, if you agree...
Sign on
For a better way
Sign on
For the fight, do what's right, our way of life
Sign on
For a better way, start today
