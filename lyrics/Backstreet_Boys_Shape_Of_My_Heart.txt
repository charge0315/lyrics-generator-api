Hmm, mmmh, yeah, yeah

Baby, please try to forgive me
Stay here, don't put out the glow
Hold me now don't bother
If every minute it makes me weaker
You can save me from the man
That I've become, oh yeah

Looking back on the things I've done
I was trying to be someone
I played my part, kept you in the dark
Now let me show you the shape of my heart

Sadness is beautiful
Loneliness is trying to call you
So help me I can't wait there's more, oh no
Touch me now, don't bother
If I was thinkin' it makes me weaker
You can save me from the man I've become

Looking back on the things I've done
I was trying to be someone
I played my part, kept you in the dark (In the dark)
Now let me show you the shape of my heart

I'm here with my confession
Got nothing to hide no more
I don't know where to start
But to show you the shape of my heart

I'm lookin' back on things I've done
I never wanna play the same old part
I'll keep you in the dark (Keep you in the dark)
Now let me show you the shape of my heart (Heart!)
Looking back on the things I've done
I was trying to be someone (Trying to be someone)
I played my part, kept you in the dark
Now let me show you the shape of my heart
(Now let me show you the true shape of my heart!)
Looking back on the things I've done
I was trying to be someone
I played my part, kept you in the dark
Now let me show you the shape of...

Show you the shape of my heart
