I was poor and lonely
Till I met the only
Man that ever moved my heart
He is such a nice man
And he is wise man
For the told me from the start
"You've always been a poor girl
They call you: baby blue
But now you'll see a new world
Where life is easy
Where the good things are waiting for you"
* High life
It's like a dream to me
High life
It doesn't seem to be
My life
I'm living like a queen
Babe babe
High life
Always on holyday
High life
Dancing the night away
High life
I'm swinging, I'm swaying
Keep playing this nice melody
Parties in moonlight
Swimming in the sunlight
In a private blue lagoon
Flying to bardados
Hunting alligators
On a rainy afternoon
I've always been a poor girl
I'll never be the same
I'm living in a new world
Where everbody
Seems to say: "Life is only game"
