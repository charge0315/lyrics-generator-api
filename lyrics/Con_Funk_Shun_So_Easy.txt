Oh, sugar, lovin' you is all I want to do
Morning, noon and evening
Your kisses wet and wild, a radiating smile
Makes loving you so easy
I think of you and me on a sandy beach
Making love and sleeping, oh, yeah
Girl, you got me treed
You’re all the love I need
And loving you is so easy
I wanna build you up
Never let you down
Take my hand and you'll see
I wanna love you and hug you
There's nothing above you
And, honey, don’t you worry 'bout me
Oh, well, well
Oh, sugar, lovin' you is all I want to do
Morning, noon and evening
(Oh, yeah, well)
Your kisses wet and wild, a radiating smile
Makes loving you so easy
Oh, baby, baby
Well, well, baby
Oh, sugar, lovin' you is all I want to do
Morning, noon and evening
(Yeah, well, yeah, well)
Girl, you got me treed
You're all the love I need
And loving you is so easy
I think of you and me on a sandy beach
Making love and sleeping
Your lips so ruby red
I think enough's been said
Loving you is so easy
(Yeah, well, well)
