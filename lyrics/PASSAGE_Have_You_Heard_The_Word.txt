You say you’re satisfied the way you’re living like you do
It’s too bad, it’s so sad
That you refuse to hear the truth
“Jesus”, He’s the answer to every want and need
Jesus makes life better for He makes our spirits clean
Chorus:
He’ll never ever leave you
Oh, no, not my Lord
He’ll never ever leave you
Oh, no, not my Lord
Have you heard the Word? You better get it now
So ask the questions
Of why or when or how
Have you heard the Word?
You better get it now
The Lord is waiting for me and thee and thou
The time is near, it grows nearer every day
Give your heart a new start
So your spirit will know the Way
“Jesus”, He’s your savior
Come on and do yourself a favor
Jesus gives the freedom to enter his Holy kingdom
Repeat Chorus
