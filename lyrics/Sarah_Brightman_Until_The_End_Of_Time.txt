Around the world in eighty days
We sailed the seven seas
A thousand nights and one
And forty more in fantasy
The prophecy in destiny was falling, calling, falling
And calling out to me

And will we find our destination
Within a time of resignation?
A night of poetry and motion
At sixty-nine
Until the end of time

If I were God and ruled the world
I'd spin a wheel of dreams
Of waking hours in paradise
And shadows in between
The prophecy in destiny was falling, calling, falling
And calling out to me

And will we find our destination
Within a time of resignation?
A night of poetry and motion
At sixty-nine
Until the end of time
Was there a moment in the madness
And then a momentary sadness?
A night of poetry and motion
All at sixty-nine
Until the end of time

Until the end of time
