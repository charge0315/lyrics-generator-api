Hide your spliff when the boops draw near
Smile, sit up and never show no fear
I man pon a cool I never show no dispute
Lord how dem love fi come and trouble this youth
Gimme di rhythm make me feel that flow
Me pickin cherry from di seeds I sow
Me roots buried way deep down low so
Even in a drought this here tree keep grow
Oooh oh oh oh
Dem back out to save this town
Back out to chop we down
Oooh oh oh oh
Dem back out to save this town
Back out to shut we down
Hide your spliffs when the boops draw near
Smile, sit up and never show no fear
I man pon a cool I never show no dispute
Lord how dem love fi come and trouble this youth
Blazin di medical grade
Hiding my eyes behind shades
Inna mi garden some kush and some haze
Never been a follower of federal ways
Oooh oh oh oh
Dem back out to save this town
Back out to chop we down
Oooh oh oh oh
Dem back out to save this town
Back out to shut we down
Hide your spliffs when the boops draw near
