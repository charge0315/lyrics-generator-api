I see the sadness deep in your eyes
Love isn't all we made it out to be
I'm not the picture that you paint of me
But won't you stay and help me mend this heart?
Don't close the door and let me see love end
Give me the chance to make it right again
The feelings from my heart were always true
I just never said these words of love to you, no
I'm gonna spend my life writin' love songs
So I can say these words, thesе words of love
I let you down but I won't let you go
Without you in my lifе, the sun won't shine
I promise all my love the second time
But won't you stay and help me mend this heart?
Don't close the door before you see love end
Give me the chance to make it right again
The feelings from my heart were always true
I just never said these words of love to you, no
I'm gonna spend my life writin' love songs
So I can say these words
(These words of love)
Words of love
(Listen to me)
Listen to me, I need you
(I couldn't live...)
I couldn't live without you, no
(Listen to me)
Listen to me, I love you, baby
(Don't go away)
Don't go away
I want you to stay, stay
(These words of love)
(Listen to me)
Listen to me, I need you
(I couldn't live...)
I couldn't live without you
(Listen to me)
Listen to me, I love you
(Don't go away)
Don't go away
I want you to stay
I just never said these words of love to you, no
I'm gonna spend my life writin' love songs
So I can say these words, these words of love
So many
So many words of love
Soft and sweet
Sweet words of love
So many
So many words of love
Sweet, sensual
