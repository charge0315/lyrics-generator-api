Baby, I'm hooked right into your love
Are you ready for mine?
Look what I got
Good loving so hot
Come on, let me show you
There are no words that can express
The way I feel now
And I want you to know
I need you in my life, ooh, baby
I want you, baby, I really do
My love is true
I need you in my life, in my life, baby
Baby, I'm hooked right into your love
Are you ready for mine?
Look what I got
Good loving so hot
Are you ready for mine?
Baby, I'm hooked right into your love
Come on, let me show you
There are no words that can express
The way I feel now
And I want you to know
I need you in my life
I want you, baby, I really do
My love is true
I need you in my life
I want you, baby, I really do
My love is true
I want you, I need you
I want you, baby, I really do
My love is true

I want you, baby, I really do
My love is true
