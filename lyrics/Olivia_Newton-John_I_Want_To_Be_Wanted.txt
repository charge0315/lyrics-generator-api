Alone
So alone that I could cry
I want to be wanted
Alone
Watching lovers passing by
I want to be wanted
When I am kissed I want his lips to really kiss me
When we're apart I want his heart to really miss me
I want to know he loves me so his eyes are misty...
That's the way I want to be loved
Alone
Just me lonely heart knows how
I want to be wanted
Right now
Not tomorrow, but right now
I want to be wanted
I want someone to share my laughter and my tears with
Someone I know I'd love to spend a million years with
Where is this someone, somewhere meant for me?
Yeah-yeah...
I want someone to share my laughter and my tears with
Someone I know I'd love to spend a million years with
Where is this someone, somewhere meant for me?
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Meant, meant for me
Ooohhh-aaahhh
Meant for me?
