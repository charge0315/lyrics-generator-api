Well well well well
Well well well well, hey
I'm gon' get you, yeah
You shake me to my knees
And you knock me off my feet
When I see you coming
Got so much style in your strut
Can't keep my eyes off you know what
When you're walking
Oh, how I want you so badly, right now
Oh, how I need you so badly, right now
I know just what I like
And I like what I see
I'm gon' get you, yeah
Push done come to shove
Now I'm begging for your love
Have some mercy

Get up off that stuff
Baby don't you wanna
Get up off that stuff
Get up off that stuff

Your sexy ways are all I see
You stir up all my energy
Girl I'm ready

You're the prey I want to stalk
Foxy lady
Girl, I could please you
If I had you right now
Girl I could squeeze you
If I had you right now
Oh, how I want you so badly, right now
Oh, how I need you so badly, right now
You shake me to my knees
And you knock me off my feet
When I see you coming
Got so much style in your strut
Can't keep my eyes off you know what
When you're walking
Blam
Get up off that stuff
Baby don't you wanna
Get up off that stuff
