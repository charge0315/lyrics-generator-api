Oh, ooh
Erica Kane

She's back on the streets, a fiend for the night (Night)
Fill you with grief, she cuts like a knife (Mmm)
Make you do things that no others could do
She’ll turn a professor into a fool, oh
She ain't hard to get, the girl gets around
And those that she met, they're destined to drown (Oh)
She'll make you change like you’d never believe
She’ll turn a working man into a thief, oh

She's Erica, Erica, Erica, Erica (Erica Kane)
She's Erica, Erica, Erica, Erica
She's Erica, Erica, Erica, Erica (She's Erica Kane)
She's Erica, Erica, Erica (Erica Kane)
She's Erica, Erica, Erica, Erica
Yo-yo, she's Erica, Erica, Erica (She's Erica Kane)
She's Erica, Erica, Erica, Erica
She's Erica, Erica, Erica (Erica Kane)

Oh
Back on the block, she's at it again
She'll be your friend as long as you spend
I know she’s torn whole familes apart
She’ll shoot a poison arrow straight through your heart
Oh, this is the day for Erica Kane
There's nothing to lose
None for her to gain (None to gain)
She'll make a honest man steal from his folks (Yeah)
And drain a million man til' he go broke, oh

She's Erica, Erica, Erica, Erica (Erica Kane)
She's Erica, Erica, Erica, Erica
She's Erica, Erica, Erica, Erica (Erica Kane)
She's Erica, Erica, Erica (Erica Kane)
She's Erica, Erica, Erica, Erica (Hey, baby)
Yo-yo, she's Erica, Erica, Erica (She's Erica Kane)
She's Erica, Erica, Erica, Erica
She's Erica, Erica, Erica (Erica Kane)

She's Erica, Erica, Erica, Erica (Ooh)
She's Erica, Erica, Erica, Erica (She's Erica Kane)
She's Erica, Erica, Erica, Erica
She's Erica, Erica, (I wanna tell somebody), Erica (Erica Kane)
She's Erica, Erica, Erica, Erica (About Erica Kane)
Yo-yo, she's Erica, Erica, Erica
She's Erica, Erica, Erica, Erica (Yeah)
She's Erica, Erica, Erica (Erica Kane)
Oh, yeah

I really don't think you should mess around
(I really wish that you wouldn’t mess around)
'Cause all she'll do (All that she can do is bring you down), oh-yeah
And there's nothing for you to gain (There’s nothing to gain)
And she goes by this name

She's Erica, Erica, Erica, Erica (Yeah)
She's Erica, Erica, Erica, Erica (Erica Kane)
She's Erica, Erica, Erica, Erica
She's Erica (Do you hear me? I wanna say it), Erica, Erica (Erica Kane)
She's Erica, Erica, Erica, Erica (Yeah)
Yo-yo, she's Erica, Erica, Erica (She's Erica Kane)
She's Erica, Erica, Erica, Erica
She's Erica, Erica, Erica (Erica Kane)

She's Erica, Erica, Erica, Erica
She's Erica, Erica, Erica, Erica
She's Erica, Erica, Erica, Erica
She's Erica, Erica, Erica (Erica Kane)
She's Erica, Erica, Erica, Erica
Yo-yo, she's Erica, Erica, Erica
She's Erica, Erica, Erica, Erica
She's Erica, Erica, Erica (Erica Kane)

Erica Kane
Ooh, Erica Kane
