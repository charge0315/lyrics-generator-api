Come on, pack your bags, clear the floor
Let's step out through the open door
Leave a note that says goodbye

And build a new house down by the sea
Get to the place we were meant to be
And you'll know it when you smile

Up at the window, searchin' the sky
Lookin' for the rainbow and don't ask why
I wanna see the rainbow come

Hey, we'll be leaving on all sides
Oh, when the rainbow comes
Na-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
La-la-la, la-la-la-la
When the rainbow comes

Mr. Postman, look and see
If there's a message in your bag for me
Could be a bomb or it could be a letter
It don't matter, it can only get better
Hey, Mr. Postman, look and see
If there's a message in your bag for me
You know it's been such a long, long time
Since I could laugh at this world of mine, yeah, yeah, yeah

Slippin' and slidin' around in your head
Be-bop-a-lula and baby, you're dead
So come on, make a bright new day

I need a prayer here, need a blessing
Cast an eye back as you run
And turn around, boy, see the rainbow come

Hey, we'll be leavin' on all sides
When the rainbow comes
When the rainbow comes
Oh, see the world from all sides
When the rainbow comes
When the rainbow comes

La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
La-la-la, la-la-la-la
La la la, when the rainbow comes
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
La-la-la, la-la-la-la
When the rainbow comes
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
