Come on over and do the twist, ah-ha
Overdo it and have a fit, ah-ha
Love you so much, it makes me sick, ah-ha
Come on over and do the twist, ah-ha

Beat me out of me (Beat it, beat it)
Beat me out of me (Beat it, beat it)
Beat me out of me (Beat it, beat it)
Beat me out of me (Beat it, beat it)
Beat me out of me (Beat it, beat it)
Beat me out of me (Beat it, beat it)
Beat me out of me (Beat it, beat it)
Beat me out of me

Overdo it and have a fit, ah-ha
Love you so much, it makes me sick, ah-ha
Come on over and shoot the shit, ah-ha

Beat me out of me (Beat it, beat it)
Beat me out of me (Beat it, beat it)
Beat me out of me (Beat it, beat it)

She keeps it pumpin' straight to my heart
She keeps it pumpin' straight to my heart
She keeps it pumpin' straight to my heart
She keeps it pumpin' straight to my heart

She keeps it pumpin' straight to my heart
She keeps it pumpin' straight to my heart
