C'mon

Ooh, baby, I don't know why
But somehow, I always seem to get
Tangled up in my pride
Ooh, baby, we're not that blind
Deep down inside, you know
This love's worth one more try
Don't push it all aside

'Cause I wanna be good for you
Didn't mean to be bad
But darling, I'm still the best
That you ever had
Just give me a chance
To let me show you how much
I wanna give you my love touch, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh
I wanna give you my love touch (Love touch), ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh (Love touch)

Why can't I climb your walls
And find somewhere to hide?
Can't I knock down your door
And drag myself inside?
I'll light your candles, baby
And maybe I'll light your life
I wanna feel the breathless end
You come to every night

This ever-changing love
Is pushing me too far
I feel the need to reach you
Right now, wherever you are
These empty arms are getting stronger
Every day, believe me, baby
They won't let you get away
No, they won't let you get away

'Cause I wanna be good for you
Didn't mean to be bad
But darling I'm still the best
That you ever had
Just give me a chance
To let me show you how much
I wanna give you my love touch (Love touch, love touch)
I wanna give you my love touch (Love touch, love touch) ooh-ooh

Come on, baby
Try me now

Ooh, you're gonna get a, ooh, you're gonna get a big love touch
Ooh, you're gonna get a, ooh, you're gonna get a big love touch
(Ooh-wee) Ooh-ooh, baby, baby
(You gotta understand) Ooh
(Yeah-ah) I need

Give me a chance to let me show you how much
I wanna give you my love touch, ooh-hoo-ooh-ooh, ooh
You know it don't matter
Things are outta control
Guess we're gonna find out
If this love is strong
Just give me a chance to win back your trust
I wanna give you my love touch, love touch, love touch

I wanna give you my love touch, (Love touch, love touch) Ooh-hoo, ooh
Gotta give my love touch
(Ooh, you're gonna get a, ooh, you're gonna get a big love touch) My love touch, love touch
(Ooh, you're gonna get a, ooh, you're gonna get a big love touch) Love touch
