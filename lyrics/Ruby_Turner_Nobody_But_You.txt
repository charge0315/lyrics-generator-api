No one ever made me feel
That I could make it
Lord, no one ever gave me anything
All they did was take it
No one, no one, ever held my hand
When I needed them to
Oh, no, nobody but you
Nobody but you
Nobody but you
Nobody, nobody but you
No one ever looked inside
At what's happening around me
I tell you, every time I felt lost
No one ever found me
No one, no one ever cried for me
When my dreams fell through
Oh, no, no, nobody but you
Nobody but you
Nobody but you
Nobody, nobody but you
No one ever said
(Lean on me)
No one ever told me
(You've got a friend)
No, nobody said, I'll be your shelter
(Ooh)
When there's troubled waters
I'm gonna be there
(Be there)
Oh, be there, oh, 'til the end
(Be there)
No, no, no, nobody but you
Nobody but you
Nobody but you
Nobody, nobody but you
