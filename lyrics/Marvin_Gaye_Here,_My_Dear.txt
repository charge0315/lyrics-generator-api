I guess I'll have to say that–this album is dedicated to you...
Although, perhaps, I may not... be happy
This is what you want
So I've conceded
I hope it makes you happy
There's a lot of truth in it, baby
I don't think I'll have any regrets, baby
But things didn't have to be the way they was, baby
You don't have the right–to use a son of mine
To keep me in line
One thing I can't do without
Is the boy whom God gave to both of us
I'm so happy... ah, for this son of mine
So here it is, baby
I hope you enjoy...
And reminisce... be happy!
Think about the kisses... the joy
But there were those other moments too
The times that were cloudy and gray... and bad
Ah, but you taught me "that was life"
May love ever possess you
May peace come into your life
May you always think of me, the way I was
I... ha... I was your baby
This is what you wanted
Here, dear...
Here it is
Here, my dear –
Here it is
