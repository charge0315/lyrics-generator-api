Yeah
You want somethin' done?
You gotta do it yourself
Ow, uh!
Yeah, I think this is gonna be another one of those funky ones
(All on our own)
Heart & Soul, d-d-dance!
(All on our own)

If I was you, and you were me
You'd want to be winning
If you want something bad, yo
You gotta wanna give your all
'Cause I believe so much in we
And, no, we're not kidding
If you feel the same as me, yo
You gotta wanna take the ball

Now I find out that nothing is given
Don't know where the cards may fall
All I know is that we've gotta get it
We've gotta make it on our own, oh

Well, I guess we're gonna have to take control (
All on our own
)
If it's up to us, we've got to take it home (
All on our own
)

Now can't you see that all we need
To be a go-getter?
Gotta make your own decisions
You gotta go for what you know
There comes a time in our lives
You wanna be bigger
Gotta keep, keep on pushing
You gotta learn to take control, yeah

Now I find out that nothing is given
Don't know where the cards may fall
All I know is that we've gotta get it
We've gotta make it on our own

Well, I guess we're gonna have to take control (All on our own)
If it's up to us, we've got to take it home (All on our own)
Gotta, gotta, take it home
Gotta, gotta, gotta take it home

Ow, uh!
Heart & Soul, d-d-dance!

Too hot to handle, too cold to hold
They're called the Ghostbusters and they're in control
Had 'em throwin' a party for a bunch of children
While all the while, the slime was under the building
So they packed up their group, got a grip, came equipped
Grabbed their proton packs out the back, and they split
Found about Vigo, the master of evil
Try to battle my boys? That's not legal

(Oh-we-oh) They're in control
(Oh-we-oh) Y-Y-Ya know it
(All on our own) I said, they're in control
(Oh-we-oh) Y-Y-Ya know it
(Oh-we-oh) Y-Y-Ya know it
(All on our own)

Well, I guess we're gonna have to take control (All on our own)
We got, we got, we got
We got, we got, we got
If it's up to us, we've got to take it home (All on our own)
Too hot to handle, too cold to hold
They're the Ghostbusters and they're in control
Well, I guess we're gonna have to take control (All on our own)
Gotta, gotta take it home
Gotta, gotta take it home
If it's up to us, we've got to take it home (All on our own)
Gotta, gotta take it home
Gotta, gotta, gotta take it home

(Oh-we-oh) Ow!
(Oh-we-oh) Y-Y-Ya know it
(All on our own)
(Oh-we-oh) Uh!
(Oh-we-oh) Y-Y-Ya know it
(All on our own)
