Trust
Not an easy thing, you say
Never thought the game of love this way you'd play
By the things you do
Never thought these things I would go through with you
Pain, trickery, and deceit, all the wrongs that you put me through
If you know, I must say still love you anyway
Never do believe my words when I try telling you my story
Have no reason, still don't trust me
No, I'm not a cheat or liar

She brought him love, she brought him joy
She brought what she brought you thought you'd never see again
She'd cheat and lied, she made you cry, said goodbye
Body's numb, think you're never gonna feel again
Then what you do know? You take it slow, here comes Jo
Things go smooth, but drama just around the bend
Don't blame me for jealousies or insecurities
Please see, 'cause I wouldn't do that to you

Don't smother me with your pain
With misery, baby, please quit (This place is just killing me)
Accusing me of all this polygamy, oh, can't you see (I feel I'm suffocating)
If not the trust, baby then, then we have what, oh, nothin' (It's too dark in it for me)
Gotta be strong for me, please, keep holding on, oh, baby (I want a love we can trust)

Wanna second chance with this love, this romance
Wanna make it last, forget the past, she hurt you bad
Let's start anew, yes, that means me and you
Gonna make it through, but you must give trust a try
Gotta be strong with this love, hold on
Gotta trust in me and we will see true victory
We'll love with ease, baby, please trust in me
It'll be heavenly, but you must give trust a try

You got burned, you got bruised
You got, so you got a kick outta that unhealthy shit
You said she you'd please her needs whatever it'd be
Still she'd cheat on her back again for the money
Now leave from it, you grow from it, get over it
I won't take the blame, so don't, 'cause I ain't having it
'Stead of givin' me the third degree, that's so mean
Don't push me out the door, I wouldn't do that to you

Don't smother me with your pain (Yeah, yeah)
With misery, baby, please quit (It's so I'm dreaming, baby, for me)
Accusing me of all this polygamy, oh, can't you see (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah)
If not the trust, baby, then we have what, oh nothin' (Love)
Gotta be strong for me, please, keep holding on, oh, baby (I want a love we can trust)

Wanna second chance with this love, this romance (Yeah, yeah)
Wanna make it last, forget your past, she hurt you bad (Let's start anew)
Let's start anew, yes, that means me and you (Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo)
Gonna make it through, but you must give trust a try
Gotta be strong with this love, hold on (Strong, hold on)
Gotta trust in me and we will see true victory (Yeah, yeah)
We'll love with ease, baby, please trust in me (Uh)
It'll be heavenly, but you must give trust a try
