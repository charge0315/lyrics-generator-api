Twenty years
Time flashes by like lightning in the sky
Twenty years of questions come down to 'Who am I?'
Thank you God for giving us all a sense of humor

Alright, it's ten to six
You've gotta go, 'cause I've gotta go
Oh, now she's throwin' me out, now that she had her little say
We have some lovely parting gifts for you, Lynette
Thanks for coming down
Ha ha, oh, she tryin' to shut me up
Do do duh do do do... (*imitates game show music*)
