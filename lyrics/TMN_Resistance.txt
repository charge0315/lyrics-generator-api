Swear allegiance, to the king
Fall to the knees, and kiss the ring
Loyalty owed, to no one now
Resistance will rise, from underground
Armies arrive, from foreign lands
Never fall, into their hands
Invasion has started, it's time to fight
Stand our ground, day or night
Enemies are coming from every corner
Desecrate everything in their path
Fortitude wanes away for all
Call to arms or you shall fall
Tanks have come, to our city streets
No more food, nothing left to eat
Women and children, their bodies bare
Smoke and bullets, have filled the air
Future bound
Here and now
Eagle soars
To strike us down
We must rise, to defend our lives
We must rise
Yeah we must rise
Allies have come, to save our skin
No more war, the end begins
Bombers have blown, us all to hell
But thanks to us, their fear shall dwell
Scorched sky, and shattered earth
Peace resides, for what it's worth
Rebuild the land, for a brand new age
We put that lion back in its cage
Salvation is bound to us now
Sanctified and born to be proud
No longer must pain be endured
Heaven knows the agony is cured
Future bound
Here and now
Eagle soars
To strike us down
We must rise, to defend our lives
We must rise
Yeah we must rise
Future bound
Here and now
Eagle soars
To strike us down
We must rise, to defend our lives
We must rise
Yeah we must rise
