Ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh

Monday, you sent me flowers
Tuesday, made me feel stupid
Wednesday, the world was ours
Thursday, you didn't prove it
Friday, fell back in love
Saturday, we didn't talk
Sunday, you said you needed space

Do you miss me? Am I crazy?
Am I losing hold of your love, baby?
Either you want me or you don't
I need to know, I need to know

Who are you today?
Will you be the sun or the pouring rain?
Who are you tomorrow?
Will you make me smile or just bring me sorrow?
Who are you gonna be when I'm lost and I'm scared?
Who are you gonna be when there's nobody there?
Who are you today?
‘Cause I am still (Still) the same

Ooh, ooh-ooh

Monday, you had my heart
Tuesday, you had me screaming
Wednesday, we didn't part
Thursday, you didn't mean it
Friday, I shook it off
Saturday, you got it wrong
Sunday, I said I needed space

Do you miss me? Am I crazy?
Am I losing hold of your love, baby?
Either you want me or you don't
I need to know, I need to know

Who are you today?
Will you be the sun or the pouring rain?
Who are you tomorrow?
Will you make me smile or just bring me sorrow?
Who are you gonna be when I'm lost and I'm scared?
Who are you gonna be when there's nobody there?
Who are you today?
'Cause I am still the same

You
Who are you? (Ooh)
Who are you?

It's so strange how the same thing
Can make you feel so right, but bring you so much pain
It's so strange how the same face
Can make you love until it hurts
Where do we go? (Where do we go?)
I need to know (I need to know)

Who are you today? (Today)
Will you be the sun or the pouring rain? (Or the pouring rain)
Who are you (Who are you?) tomorrow?
Will you make me smile or just bring me sorrow?
Who are you gonna be when I'm lost and I'm scared?
Who are you gonna be when there's nobody there?
Who are you (Who are you) today? (Today?)
'Cause I am still (I'm still) the same, ah, the same

Ooh, ooh-ooh
