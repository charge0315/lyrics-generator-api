She put the cream in my coffee (First thing in the morning)
Put that butter on my biscuit (Honeydew my melons)
Cherries on bananas (Gonna need a second helpin')
You know I'm up for breakfast so early in the morning
Lock the front... Leave the back door open
Yeah, hot tub loosen up, baby been soakin'

Slip slide slippin'... all got me tripping
Well... I'm going crazy
Keeping it up, pumping it up, pumping it up
Oh, yeah

She put the cream in my coffee (First thing in the morning)
Spread that butter on my biscuit (Honeydew my melon)
Put berries on bananas (I need a second helping)
That's why I'm up for breakfast so early in the morning
Wake me up babe
Hold me up, wake me up... Gotta get up, gotta get up, gotta get up, gotta get up

She put the cream in my coffee (First thing in the morning)
Spread hot butter on my biscuit (Honeydew my melon)
Like them cherries on bananas (Gonna need a second helping)
Thats why I'm up for breakfast so early in the morning
Got bacon on the table (First thing in the morning)
Squeeze some honey on my biscuit (Honeydew my melon)
Spread some cream on my bananas (I need a second helping)
You know I'm up for breakfast so early in the mornin'
Hot sweet sticky
Get it up, get it up, get it up
Wake me up babe
Wake me up babe
Lift me up baby
Gotta get up, Gotta get up
Hot coffee first thing in the morning
Gotta get up
