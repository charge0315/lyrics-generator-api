Tear it down, start over again
We can make a brand new start
I can tell you're acting strange
What did i do to make you change
Something's building up inside of you
Something that could tear our love in two
Don't let our love let us down
Don't let our love let us down
So just
Tear it down, start over again
We can make a brand new start
Tear it down, start over again
We can make a brand new start
Girl, i've spent my life loving you
Please don't go, don't say that we're through
I'll pull the moon out of the sky for you
Crawl the desert sand if you asked me to
So
Don't let our love let us down
Don't let our love let us down
So just
Tear it down, start over again
We can make a brand new start
Tear it down, start over again
We can make a brand new start
Don't let our love let us down
Don't let our love let us down
So just
Tear it down, start over again
We can make a brand new start
Tear it down, start over again
We can make a brand new start
Tear it down, start over again
We can make a brand new start
(Pull the moon from the sky, i said i'll cross the desert sand on my knees in pain for you)
Tear it down, start over again
We can make a brand new start
(Darling i've spent my whole life just loving you, to take yourself from me, no, this won't do)
(Got to help me save it)
Tear it down
(Got to help me save it)
Start over again
(Got to help me save it)
We can make a brand new start
Tear it down
Start over again
We can make a brand new start
(We can make it all over again)
