So, my friend
Voices from the past reunite at last
Back when we grew up on the streets
The world was at our feet
Do you recall the two of us?
How we used to sing when everything was new to us
From the time that we were old enough to stand
It was you and I together to the end

Oh, what our souls believe
We will always be blood brothers
Time can't divide what our hearts have said
With a drop of red
Blood brothers 'til the end
Through the years
Time has not been kind to others left behind
The street where you and I once played
There's nothing left today
What happened to the dream we shared?
Do we just go on and on like it was never there?
Can I tell you that there's hope beyond these walls
And to help you I'll do anything at all
Oh, what our souls believe
We will always be blood brothers
Time can't divide what our hearts have said
With a drop of red
Blood brothers
The bond we make never will break
Blood brothers 'til the end
From the time that we were old enough to stand
It was you and I together 'til the end
Chorus
Blood brothers still
Blood brothers still
Blood brothers 'til the end
