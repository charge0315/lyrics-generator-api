Get rid of something you like, to mix with medicine
Shots of pictures, that keep themselves on TV Screens
From an ad, it looked like fun
Walk straight, 'til it tilts the whole room
It'll wad up nice
And my ease like the devil, is self cunning
My eyes can't take it, my head don't want it
I can't see my feet

I'm walking straight now, I wanna go home now
Or eat something soon
But I can't see through it, I can't see through it
There's no way home

With face like pillars
Walk past everything
But not really
Because our eyes meet
But if their hearts sort of bar off now
Live forever, in a few-second spell
I open my eyes now, and it gets inside me
And I get blessed
It's so fog-like, I can't see
And then I get dressed

Nothing can touch us because everything in us
Is digital code
I can't see through it, there's no way back
I can't get home
Nothing can touch us, because everything in us
Is digital code
I can't see through it, there's no way back
I can't get home
Nothing can touch us, because everything in us
Is digital code
