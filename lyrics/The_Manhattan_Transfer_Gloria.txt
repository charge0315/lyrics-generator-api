It's not Marie
Gloria
It's not Cherie
Gloria (Gloria)
But she's not in love with me
Can't you see
It's not Marie
Gloria
It's not Cherie
Gloria (Gloria)
But she's not in love with me
And maybe (maybe)
She'll want me (want me)
But who am I to know (who am I to know)
And maybe (ooh, maybe)
She'll want me (ooh, want me)
But who am I to know (who am I to know)
Oh---
Gloria (Gloria)
It's not Marie
Gloria (Gloria)
It's not Cherie
Gloria (Gloria)
'Cause she's not in love with me
Gloria!
