Lights in the shadow of a darkened room
His face lit under the glow of the moon
Fingers winding circles in my hair
Holding me in his penetrating stare
I ain't going nowhere
Just one touch and I'm runnin' hot
I'm about to die but I don't wanna stop
I breathe in his sweet love satisfied
Then we kiss and it's so divine
Everytime
He takes my breath, 'cause he takes his time
He takes my soul, body and mind
He takes what he wants and that's just fine
He takes my breath everytime
He slides his fingers cross my lips
Like drawing a map into his kiss
Divine
So fine
Everytime
He takes my breath, 'cause he takes his time
He takes my soul, body and mind
He takes what he wants and that's just fine
He takes my breath everytime
Everytime
