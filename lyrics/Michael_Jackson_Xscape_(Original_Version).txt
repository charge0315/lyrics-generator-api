"Open up six"
"He's gone!"

Everywhere I turn, no matter where I look
The system's in control, it's all run by the book
I gotta get away so I can free my mind
Xscape is (what I need) from the (electric eyes)
No matter where I am, I see my face around
They pin lies on my name then push from town to town
Don't have a place to run but there's no need to hide
I gotta, find a place, but I won't, hide away

Xscape
Gotta get away from the system rules in the world today
Xscape
The pressure that I face from relationships has to go away
Xscape
(The man with the pen that writes the lies that have no end)
Xscape
I do what I wanna cause I gotta face nobody but me

Sometimes I feel like
I've gotta get away

I tried to share my life with someone I can love
But games and money is all she ever thought of
How could that be my fault when she gambled and lost?
I'm tired of silly games, it's time to make a change
Why is it I can't do whatever I want to
When it's my personal life and I don't live for you
So don't you try to tell me what is right for me
You be concerned about you, I can do what I want to

Xscape (Hoo-hoo!)
Gotta get away from the system rules in the world today (I've gotta get away)
Xscape
The pressure that I face from relationships has to go away
Xscape
The man with the pen that writes the lies that have no end (I've gotta get away)
Xscape
I do what I wanna cause I gotta face nobody but me (I've gotta get away)
Xscape
Gotta get away from the system rules in the world today
Xscape (Yeah)
The pressure that I face from relationships has to go away
Xscape
The man with the pen that writes the lies that have no end (Hoo-hoo!) (C'mon, now)
Xscape
I do what I wanna cause I gotta face nobody but me (Hoooooo-hoo-hoo!) (C'mon, now)

When I go
This problem world won't bother me
This problem world
This problem world, won't bother me, won't bother me, no more
Yeah! Oh! Yeah! Hooo!
