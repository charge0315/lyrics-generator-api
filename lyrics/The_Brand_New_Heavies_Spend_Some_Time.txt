I had a picture of you in my head
It kept me warm when you were not there
You made me laugh made me feel like
A child to see your smile made everything worthwhile
I feel a glow when you are near
All of my doubt just disappear
But baby nothing stays the same
It's such a shame
Chorus:
Spend some time trying to figure out
What to do with this love what to do with this love
Now it seems like the best thing baby
Is just give it up
Let's just give it up
So now you play trick with my mind
I am gonna leave your loving all behind
You were my joy
You were my pain
Something is lost when something is gained
Don't worry baby I'll be fine
I'll grow tired of you wasting my time
Don't bother pleading
Or trying to stop me
It's too late now I've just
Got to be free
Chorus
Baby just give it up
I've just had enough
Give it up
Give it up
I've just had enough
Chorus
