Hey, Valentina, tell your mama
She should give me a call
When she get tired of running
After you down the hall

Before you came onto the scene
It was a Hollywood mess
(Hey, Valentina)
Your mama was a movie queen
She was one of the best
(Hey, Valentina)
Every boy had the hots for her
Around the world even girls adored her
Mexican bombshell
Come to conquer the west
(Hey, Valentina) Hey, hey, hey

Hey, Valentina, tell your mama
She should give me a call
When she get tired of running
After you down the hall

And she's all worn out
From those late night feedings
And she ready for another
Rock and roll meeting
Oh, Valentina, tell your mama
She should give me a call, yes she should

Your uncle Sami used to hold it down every day
(Hey, Valentina)
Watch the bootyguards scarecrow the buzzards away
Watch out (Hey, Valentina)
Like an aeroplane the time flies
Over so many guys
They couldn't get your sweet little mama to stay
(Hey, Valentina)

Hey, Valentina, tell your mama
She should give me a call
When she get tired of running
After you down the hall

All worn out
Late night feedings (Late night)
Rock and roll meeting
Tell your mama she should give me a call

Curvier than a fender Stratocaster guitar
Reality bender: from no green card to superstar
Broken up slang even when
The king of Hollywood ain't that tall
Sho' as Betty's ugly, your mama's bigger than 'em all
Hear me, y'all (Hey, Valentina)
(Hey, Valentina)

Give me a call
Walkin' down that funky hall, yeah
Oh yeah
That's all right
Yeah
Tell your mama

Hey, Valentina, tell your mama
She should give me a call
(Hey, Valentina)
When she get tired of running
After you down the hall
(Hey, Valentina)

Tell your mama she should call up Mia
In advance
If Penelope wants to cruise
There ain't no way that we ain't going to dance
Tell your mama
Tell your mama she should should give me a call
Oh, that's all
Hey, Valentina, tell your mama
She should give me a call
