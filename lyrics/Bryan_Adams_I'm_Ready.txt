I'd like to see you, thought I'd let you know
I wanna be with you everyday, hey
Cause I've got a feeling that's beginning to grow
And there's only one thing I can say, yeah

I'm ready to love you
I'm ready to hold you, don't you know
I'm ready to love you
I'm ready, I'm ready
As ready as I'm gonna be

She left me a long note when she left me here
Told me that love was hard to find
But baby it's easy and I'll make it clear
That there's only one thing on my mind

I'm ready to love you
I'm ready to hold you, don't you know
I'm ready to love you
I'm ready, I'm ready
As ready as I'm gonna be
I'm ready to love you
I'm ready to hold you, don't you know
I'm ready to love you
I'm ready to hold you, girl don't you know
I'm ready to love you, come on now
I'm ready to hold you
I'm ready to love you, sweet babe
I'm ready to hold you, I'm ready, ready
I'm ready to love you
I'm ready to hold you
