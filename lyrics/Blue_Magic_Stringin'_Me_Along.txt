You're just stringin' me along
How can I go on
You're just stringin' me along
Tired of holding on
To a dream
Every time I see your face
I know it's the same
You won't ever change your ways
Because it's your game
Gave you all the best of me (of me)
But you were too blind to see
Well, I've taken all I can take
And that string is about to break
You're just stringin' me along
How can I go on
You're just stringin' me along
Tired of holding on
You're just stringin' me along
Tired of holding on
To a dream
Morning comes and you're not here
I wait all alone
Packed my bags, I'm leaving here
Goodbye, yes I'm gone
Think it's time for us to part (to part)
I have to try to save my heart
Well, I've taken all I can take
And that string is about to break
You're just stringin' me along
How can I go on
You're just stringin' me along
Tired of holding on
You're just stringin' me along
How can I hold on
To a dream
Gave you all the best of me (of me)
But you were too blind to see
Well, I've taken all I can take
And that string is about to break
You're just stringin' me along
How can I go on
You're just stringin' me along
Tired of holding on
You're just stringin' me along
Tired of holding on
To a dream
Oh, stringin' me along
You're just stringin' me along
Takin' me for a ride, stringin' me along
You're just stringin' me along
Stringin' me along
You're just stringin' me along
You're just takin' me for a ride
Stringin' me along, oh
Stringin' me along
You're just stringin' me along
Stringin' me along
You're just stringin' me along
You're just takin' me for a ride
Stringin' me along, oh
Stringin' me along
