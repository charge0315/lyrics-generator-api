Hey, if you really wanna come along with me
Smile
(Baby, baby, baby won't you smile with me, smile with me)
If you really wanna stay a while with me
(Smile with me, hey yeah)
Smile
(Smile, baby, baby, won't you smile with me)
Won't you come along with me
Shining faces we will see
Greet with you a smile
Making all our time worthwhile
Let's participate
In the love our smiling face
I guess we will arrange
New vibrations we'll exchange
Smile with me, come drive with me
The time will fly as we pass by
Won't you smile with me
Together we give in our hearts to love
If you wanna stay a while with me
Smile
(Baby, baby won't you smile with me)
I'll share with you a song
We'll erase the right and wrong
Music that we give
Smiling faces learn to live
Smile with me, come drive with me
The time will fly as we pass by
Won't you smile with me
Together we give in our hearts to love
Come on
I wanna know if the smile is in you
If you wanna come along with me
Smile
(Baby, baby, baby won't you smile with me, smile with me)
If you think you really wanna stay a while with me
(Smile with me, hey yeah)
Smile
(Smile, baby, baby, won't you smile, hey yeah)
(Hey yeah, hey yeah, hey, hey)
(Hey yeah, hey yeah, hey, hey)
(Hey yeah, hey yeah, hey, hey)
(Hey yeah, hey yeah, hey)
Smile with me, come drive with me
The time will fly as we pass by
Won't you smile with me
Together we give in our hearts to love
