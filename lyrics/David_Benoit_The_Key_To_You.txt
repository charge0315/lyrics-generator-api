Good things will come your way
You'll find a brighter day

All I can be
All I want to do
Is be the one inside the world
Who finds the key to you
All the promises
Never quite came true
Found a way to live again
When I found the key to you
When I found the key to you

Good things will come your way
You'll find a brighter day

All that I can be
All I want to do
Is be the one inside the world
Who finds the key to you
All the promises
That never quite came true
Found a way to live again
When I found the key to you
When I found the key to you

Good things will come your way (ooh, good things)
You'll find a brighter day (find a brighter day)

All that I can be
All I want to do
Is be the one inside the world
Who finds the key to you
All the promises
Never quite came true
Found a way to live again
When I found the key to you
When I found the key to you

Oh, I found the key to you
Noo, I found out
My life became complete
Feels so good
That I found the key to you
