I was walkin' down the street
Concentratin' on truckin' right
I heard a dark voice beside of me
And I looked 'round in a state of fright
I saw four faces one mad a brother from the gutter
They looked me up and down a bit and turned to each other
(i say) I don't like cricket-a oh no I love it-a yeah
I don't like cricket-a no no I love it-a yeah
Don't you walk through my words you got to show some respect
Don't you walk through my words 'cause you ain't heard me out yet
Well he looked down at my silver chain
He said "I'll give you one dollar"
I said "you've got to be joking man
It was a present from me mother"
He said "I like it I wan' it I'll take it off your hands
An' you'll be sorry you'd crossed me
You'd better understand that you're a long, a long way from home"
(and I say) I don't like Reggae-a no no I love it-a hey
I don't like Reggae-a yeah yeah I love it-a oh yeah
Don't you cramp me style don't you queer me pitch
Don't you walk through my words 'cause you
Ain't heard me out yet
I hurried back to the swimming pool
Sinkin' pina colada
I heard a dark voice beside me say
Would you like something hotter
She said "I've got it you wan' it my harvest is the best
And if you try it you'll like it and wallow in the
Dreadlock holiday, dreadlock holiday, dreadlock holiday"
(and I say) don't like Jamaica oh no I love her hey
Don't like Jamaica oh no I love her oh yeh
Don't you walk through my words you got to show some respect
Don't you walk through my words 'cause you ain't heard me out yet
I don't like cricket-a oh no I love it-a dreadlock holiday
I don't like Reggae-a oh no I love it-a dreadlock holiday
Don't like Jamaica hey I love her dreadlock holiday
I don't like cricket-a oh no I love it-a dreadlock holiday
I don't like Reggae
