We've been working all day
We're as tired as we can be
We've been working all day
We're as tired as we can be
I'm gonna go get my baby
And take him on home with me
Oooh...oh a oh a ......
I'll see you later
I'll see you later
One of these days
One of these days
Ooh, see you later
Bye bye (Bye bye)
So-o-o long
