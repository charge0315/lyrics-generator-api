Someone said life is for the takin',here I am with my hand out
Waitin' for a ride
I've been livin' on my great expectations,what good is it when I'm stranded here
And the world just passes by?
Where are the signs,to help me get out of this place?
If I should stumble on my moment in time
How will I know?
If the story's written on my face
Does it show?
Am I strong enough to walk on water
Smart enough to come in out of the rain?
Or am I a fool?
Goin' where the wind blows
(where the wind blows)
Here I sit halfway to somewhere,thinking 'bout what's in front of me
And what I left behind
On my own supposed to be so easy,is this what I've been after
Or have I lost my mind?
Maybe this is my chance,and it's coming to take me away,yeah
If I should stumble on my moment in time
How will I know?
If the story's written on my face
Does it show?
Am I strong enough to walk on water
Smart enough to come in out of the rain?
Or am I a fool?
Goin' where the wind blows
(where the wind blows)
Here I am,walking naked through the world
Taking up space,society's child
Make room for me,make room for me,make room for me
Am I strong enough to walk on water
Smart enough to come in out of the rain?
Or am I a fool?
Goin' where the win blows
(where the wind blows)
(la la la la la la la)
(la la la la la la la )
