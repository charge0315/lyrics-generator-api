Ay, ay yo, ay, you know what I think we need to do?
We need to just take over this class when this teacher come in, man
I'm for real man!
You need to sit down and shut up!
We need to take over your hairline first!
Oh, it's like that now?
We need to take over your hairline first
Oh, it's like that? It's like that now?
...assault on your hairline!
(laughter)

Okay, okay people, party's over, party's over
Please settle down, settle down
Take out your notebooks, please. Thank you
Okay, good morning class
Today we'll be discussing Beethoven and his works in the early, middle and latе periods
Some of you know up until 1802, his works show up aggressivе mastery style of classic music
Specifically Haydn symphonies
Again that's Haydn symphonies which both develop his form and texture
What I will do for you is play you a piece of Beethoven's music so please listen carefully

Mr. Levins, why are you sleeping in my classroom?
Aw man, this is the most boringest thing I've ever heard, man
Oh, really?
If you were Beethoven, what would have done?
Man, if I was Beethoven, I would have flipped that
Straight G, man
Hm
Well stand in front of the class and show us how you would just have flipped it!
