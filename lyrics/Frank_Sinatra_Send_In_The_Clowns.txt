This is a song about a couple of adult people who have spent
Oh, quite a long time together
'Til one day, one of 'em gets restless and decides to leave
Whether it's the man or woman who left is unimportant
It's a breakup
And it's a lovely marriage of words and music
Written by Stephen Sondheim

Isn't it rich?
Are we a pair?
Me here at last on the ground
And you in mid-air
Send in the clowns

Isn't it bliss?
Don't you approve?
One who keeps tearing around
And one who can't move
But where are the clowns?
Send in the clowns

Just when I stopped opening doors
Finally finding the one that I wanted was yours
Making my entrance again with my usual flair
Sure of my lines, nobody's there

Don't you love a farce?
My fault, I fear
I thought that you'd want what I want
Sorry, my dear
But where are the clowns?
Send in the clowns
Don't bother, they're here

Isn't it rich?
Isn't it queer
Losing my timing this late
In my career?
But where are the clowns?
Send in the clowns
Well, maybe next year
