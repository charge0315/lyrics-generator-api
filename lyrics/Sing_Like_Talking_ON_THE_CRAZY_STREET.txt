"Won't you be my man?", she says, and hesitates
Freaky fear's got a hold on time
"You will never get my love, I tell you straight"
Answers he with her best in mind
But, girl, oh, don't you give up now
A little faith will make him come up to you
Emptiness, it fills the streets and minds
Everyone just moving on alone
We're just misled on the crazy street
Just confused by its tricky beat
Just mislead on the crazy street
Nobody's to blame, yeah
"I'm gonna make her mine," he says, "I'll educate"
Selfish thoughts got a hold on him
Try and rеalize the need, yeah, consummatе
Take a look in the mirror, fool
Oh boy, you've got those hungry eyes
Did you know that beast you keep inside?
Dirty rivers, loud lights, stagnant air, yeah
Can't you see that's just the way you are?
We're just misled on the crazy street
Just confused by its tricky beat
Just mislead on the crazy street
Nobody's to blame, yeah
We search, we need someone that will really care
Ooh, that's right
Walk that street of strangers, find a smile that feeds you
You're going fine, this time, your love may be alright
But, girl, oh, don't you give up now
A little faith will make him come up to you
Emptiness, it fills the streets and minds
Everyone just moving on alone, ooh, yeah
We're just misled on the crazy street
Just confused by its tricky beat
Just mislead on the crazy street
Nobody's to blame, yeah
We're just misled on the crazy street
Just confused by its tricky beat
Just mislead on the crazy street
Nobody's to blame, yeah
We're just misled on the crazy street
Just confused by its tricky beat
Just mislead on the crazy street
Nobody's to blame, yeah
We're just misled on the crazy street
Just confused by its tricky beat
Just mislead on the crazy street
