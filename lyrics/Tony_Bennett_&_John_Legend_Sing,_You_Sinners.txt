Brothers, sisters, listen to what we say
Moaning and groaning won't dry those blues away
Lift up your voices in song
You know you've all done wrong, you sinners

Drop everything
Let the harmony ring
Up to Heaven
Sing, you sinners

Just wave your arms all about
Let the Lord hear you shout
Pour the music right out
Sing, you sinners

Whenever there's music
The devil kicks
He don't allow music
By the river Styx

You're wicked and you're depraved
And you're all misbehaved
If you wanna be saved
Sing, you sinners

Well up until now, we've been asking everybody to sing
But if you won't sing, come on, dance
Go, man, swing
Go, yeah
Swing, swing
Ba-ba-ba-bo-da-do-day
Swing, swing, swing, swing, you sinners

Whenever there's music
The devil kicks
Oh, he don't allow music
By the river Styx

You're wicked and you're depraved
And you're all misbehaved
Oh, if you wanna be saved
If you wanna be saved
Well then sing, you sinners
Ba-ba-ba, ba-ba-ba, ba-ba-bay-bo-ba
Ba-do-day
