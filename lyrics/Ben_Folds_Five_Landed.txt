Habit isn't bliss
Sunshine isn't missed
Happy when you're cold
Wanna be alone
He's a lot of steam
She's a lot of breath
Takes a lot to see
Takes a lot to beg
And it's just like Mitchell Lane
Everything's the same
Wanna kill your friends
Reminding you of when
Happy when you're stoned
Wanna be old
And it's just like Mitchell Lane
Everything's the same
So go on and go on and complain
Remember when we were
Fifteen and Robbie made
That stupid face all day
I guess he made his point
'Cause I'm still here
When I could be anywhere
Habit isn't bliss
Sunshine isn't missed, oh
And it's just like Mitchell Lane
Everything's the same
So go on and go on and complain
And it's just like Mitchell Lane
Everything's the same
So go on and go on and complain
