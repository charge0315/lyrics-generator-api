All winter I'd been so alone
My heart was freezing to the bone
A nightmare
(A nightmare)
My future life was in the dark
Until I met you in the park
Hey hi-there
(Hey hi-there)
At first you were only a stranger
(A total stranger)
But now you mean so much to me
*
A new sensation
Pure temptation
Good vibration
I've been in love before
But now it's so much more
*
A new sensation
Fascination
Fancy, I love you, I love you
The magic of three little words
Means more than all the universe to me
*
This lovely summer holiday
Is like no other holiday
I'm dreaming
(I'm dreaming)
An island just for you and me
A beach where no one else can see
Me dreaming
(I'm dreaming)
One kiss and the world seems to vanish
(It seems to vanish)
When I feel the heavenly bliss
* (Repeat)
** Repeat
I can see the lovelights burn
On the point of no return
