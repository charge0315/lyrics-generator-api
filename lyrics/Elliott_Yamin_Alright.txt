If you want something new maybe I got what you need
And if you just want to groove you can come get next to me
Well baby I'm tried and true what you get is what you see
We can do what you want to do cause I got no place to be
I said it's alright Yeah
We got all night Woah
I said it's alright Woah
We got all night Woah
I see you from across the room hot enough you could stop the beat
And people comin up to you but no one you care to meet
Something about the way you move is turning up the heat
Anything that you want to do, anywhere that you want to be
Saying it's alrighty Yeah
We got all night Woah
I said it's alright
Cause we got all night Woah
Girl you're so fine, make my temperature rise
And maybe for a minute we can indiscrimately dip out of sight
Ah, baby, you're so right, ah, baby
I can't get you out of that place in my mind
That makes a man crazy enough to do it all night (baby)
You're so fine
I said it's alright Yeah
We got all night Woah
I said it's alright Woah
We got all night Woah
All night Yeah
We got all night Woah
I said ti's alright Yeah
Cause we got all night Woah
