You stare at him at night and think of schemes
I stay with her each night, but you're in my dreams
You telling him that you're going out just to meet some friends
I wonder if this great charade will ever ever end

We're just a midnight love affair
We get together and go nowhere
I'd really like to tell the world we care
But we're just another late night love affair

You have a little boy you really love
I have a little daughter that I place no one above
If by chance you see me walking down the street
You know that eyes like ours should never ever meet

We're just a midnight love affair
We get together and go nowhere
I'd really like to tell the world we care
But we're just another late night love affair
Just a midnight love affair
We get together and go nowhere
I'd really like to tell the world we care
But we're just another late night love affair

Hang-ups cause a slip of the tongue
Things that make us come undone
The little white lies we tell our friends
To hold our love until the end
We never seem to quit the lies
We live inside a grim disguise
We love each other in our mind
An answer is what we must find

We're just a midnight love affair
We get together and go nowhere
I'd really like to tell the world we care
But we're just another late night love affair

We're just a midnight love affair
