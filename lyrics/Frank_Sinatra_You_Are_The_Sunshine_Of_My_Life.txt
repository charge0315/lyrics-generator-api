You are the sunshine of my life
That's why I'll always be around
You are the apple of my eye
Forever you'll stay in my heart

I feel like this is the beginning
Though I loved you for one million years
If I thought our love was ending
I'd find myself drowning in my own tears

You are the sunshine of my life
That's why I'll always be around
You are the apple of my eye
Forever you'll stay in my heart

You must have known that I was lonely
Because you came to my rescue
And though I know that this must be heaven
How could so much love be inside of you

You are the sunshine of my life
That's why I'll always be around
You are the apple of my eye
Forever you'll stay in my heart

'Cause you are
The sunshine of my life
Light my fire, light my fire, light my fire
