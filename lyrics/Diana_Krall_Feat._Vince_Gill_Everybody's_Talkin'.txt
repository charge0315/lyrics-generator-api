Everybody's talkin' at me
I don't hear a word they're saying
Only the echoes of my mind
People stoppin', starin'
I can't see their faces
Only the shadows of their eyes

I'm going where the sun keeps shinin'
Through the pouring rain
Going where the weather suits my clothes
Banking off of the northeast winds
Sailing on a summer breeze
And skipping over the ocean like a stone

Everybody's talkin' at me
I don't hear a word they're saying
Only the echoes of my mind
People stoppin', starin'
I can't see their faces
Only the shadows of their eyes

I'm going where the sun keeps shinin'
Through the pouring rain
Going where the weather suits my clothes
Banking off of the northeast winds
Sailing on a summer breeze (Sail on, sail on)
Skipping over the ocean like a stone
Hmm

Everybody's talkin' at me
Can't hear a word they're sayin'
Only the echoes of my mind
No I won't let you leave my love behind

Everybody's talkin' at me
I don't hear a word they're saying
Everybody's talkin' at me
I don't hear a word they're saying
Everybody's talkin' at me
