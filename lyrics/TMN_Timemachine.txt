Well he comes in here on the 1st and 15th
Pockets just jinglin' like a tambourine
Makes a beeline over to that old jukebox
Fills it up to the top and the needle drops

And it's off like a rocket in a neon haze
Spinnin' 'em back to the good old days
Beer gets to flowin' and the whiskey pours
There ain't an empty spot on the old dance floor
All cowboy hats, boots, and jeans
Ridin' that honky-tonk time machine

He's gonna make damn sure the jukebox don't rock
And the record's gonna be the only thing that bops
He's an old-school, cold longneck DJ
And look at him now, here comes them old green snakes

And it's off like a rocket in a neon haze
Spinnin' 'em back to the good old days
Beer gets to flowin' and the whiskey pours
There ain't an empty spot on the old dance floor
All cowboy hats, boots, and jeans
Ridin' that honky-tonk time machine

From A to Z, and everything between
He's flying that honky-tonk time machine

And it's off like a rocket in a neon haze
Spinnin' 'em back to the good old days
Beer gets to flowin' and the whiskey pours
There ain't an empty spot on the old dance floor
All cowboy hats, boots, and jeans
Ridin' that honky-tonk time machine
Everybody's back in MWZ
They're ridin' that honky-tonk time machine

Well he comes in here on the 1st and 15th
Pockets just jinglin' like a tambourine
Makes a beeline over to that old jukebox
Fills it up to the top and the needle drops
