It was a long and dark December
From the rooftops, I remember
There was snow, white snow
Clearly I remember
From the windows, they were watchin'
While we froze down below
When the future's architectured
By a carnival of idiots on show
You'd better lie low

If you love me
Won't you let me know?

Was a long and dark December
When the banks became cathedrals
And the fox became God
Priests clutched onto Bibles
Hollowed out to fit their rifles
And a cross was held aloft
Bury me in armour
When I'm dead and hit the ground
My nerves are poles that unfroze

And if you love me
Won't you let me know?

Woah, woah

I don't wanna be a soldier
Who the captain of some sinking ship
Would stow far below

So if you love me
Why'd you let me go?

I took my love down to Violet Hill
There we sat in snow
All that time she was silent still
So if you love me
Won't you let me know?
If you love me
Won't you let me know?
