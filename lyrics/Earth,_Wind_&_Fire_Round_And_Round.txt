Called you up last Wednesday morning
Wanna go to lunch to see you smile
Said you had to wait til evening
'You gotta make a run, got another one on the line, yes you do
Don't you know your love is mine?
Round and round you're taking me baby
Round and round
Round and round, it's driving me crazy
Round and round
If you'd let me, girl, I'd show you love
Stronger than you've ever seen
Maybe that's not what you're thinking of
'Cause you've gotta make a run, got another one on the line, yeah
Love like this is hard to find
Round and round you're taking me baby
Round and round
Round and round, it's driving me crazy
Round and round
You can't keep doing me wrong
In my heart there's love so strong
Round and round and round I go
When I stop you'll never know
