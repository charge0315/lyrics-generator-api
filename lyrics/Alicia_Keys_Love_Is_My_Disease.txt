When you're gone, it feels like
My whole world's gone with you
I thought love would be my cure
But now, it's my disease
I try to act mature
But I'm a baby when you leave
How can I ever get used to being without you?
(Yeah)

Baby, baby, baby
Am I addicted
When I need you here all the time, oh?
And I'm not sure if this is healthy
Is it a sickness?
'Cause I feel like I'm losin' my mind
And I know that there's no medicine
Nothing I can take, no remedy
Baby, please stay

Oh, when you're gone, it feels like
My whole world's gone with you
I thought love would be my cure
But now, it's my disease (My disease)
I try to act mature
But I'm a baby when you leave
How can I ever get used to being without you? (Yeah)

Oh, oh, oh, baby, baby, baby, baby
I get a fever
Just the thought of you leaving my side
Oh, and I'm not the same 'til you're back holding me
That's all I need
Oh, yeah

When you're gone, it feels like (When you're gone, baby)
My whole world's gone with you (Gone with you)
I thought love would be my cure
But now, it's my disease (My disease)
I try to act mature
But I'm a baby when you leave
How can I ever get used to being without you?

Oh, here's what I'm going through when you're gone
Some serious symptoms of withdrawal
Tossin' and turnin' in my bed
Wakin' up drenched in a cold sweat
Lyin' here longing for you
What am I supposed to do
When I'm stuck and I can't get enough of your love?
Oh, whoa, baby

When you're gone, it feels like (When you're gone, baby)
My whole world's gone with you (Gone with you)
I thought love would be my cure
But now, it's my disease (My disease)
I try to act mature
But I'm a baby when you leave
How can I ever get used to being without you?
