(J.P. Maunick/R. Bull)
Smile, like a happy child
Feelin' safe in your embrace
Shine, sunshine
Kiss you warmly on your face
This is the place where I am free
There is no where else I'd rather be
Chorus:
Than here in your arms
Hypnotised by your charms
Every touch means so much
Boy, you blow my mind
I love what you do for me
(I love what you do, I love what you do)
What you do for me, baby
Close your eyes
And I'll creep into your dreams
Through your mind, weave a secret on your soul
All that you dream, I'm dreamin' too
No one else could take the place of you
(I wanna be)
Chorus
I love what you do for me
Close to you's where I wanna be
Baby, baby, baby, baby (Oh)
Chorus
Repeat (Fade)
