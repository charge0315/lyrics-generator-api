Enough for me is not much for you
Won't you forgive me, that's all I can do
Can you feel my heartbeat when I'm close to you, oh-oh, oh-oh?
Can you feel my heartbeat when I'm close to you, oh-oh, oh-oh?
Enough for me is not much for you
Won't you forgive me, that's all I can do
Can you feel my heartbeat when I'm close to you?
Can you feel my heartbeat when I'm close to you?
I'll never find another way to say, I love you more each day
It's quite romantic, I know, that's how I wanna feel today
I wanna feel this way
Can you feel my heartbeat when I'm close to you, oh-oh, oh-oh?
Can you feel my heartbeat when I'm close to you, oh-oh, oh-oh?
I'll never find another way to say, I love you more each day
It's quite romantic, I know, that's how I wanna feel today
I wanna feel this way today
Can you feel my heartbeat? Can you feel my heartbeat?
Can you feel my heartbeat? Can you feel my heartbeat?
Can you feel my heartbeat? Can you feel my heartbeat?
Can you feel my heartbeat when I'm close to you?
I'll never find, no I'll never find another way to say
I love you more each day
