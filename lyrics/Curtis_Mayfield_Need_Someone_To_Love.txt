I just can't wait to love you
Gotta see my woman right now
We ain't getting any younger
Need someone to love
When clouds come it's rainin'
Sun come up and shine, shine, shine
Lord, I ain't complainin'
I've done a little bit wrong and I said a lot of times
But if there's any good in me
I'll bring it out so that you might see that
I'm just another lonely man that
Wanna stop all the crimes and start over again
And I just can't wait in the line
Gotta see my woman right now
We ain't getting any younger
Need someone to love
This woman on the other side
She's every bit of the better half and all of my pride
Though I've hurt her so constantly
She's always had faith and trust in me
But how long can a good thing last?
Though I vow never to hurt her in the past
Will she be there waiting for me?
Five long years now you will free, free, free
Need someone to love
Gotta see my woman right now
We ain't getting any younger
Need someone to love
I just can't wait to love you
Gotta see my woman right now
We ain't getting any younger
Need someone to love
