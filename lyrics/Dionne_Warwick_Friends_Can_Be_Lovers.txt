Something's clouding up my rainbow
Something's messing with my sky
And I don't know what's happening
But something's missing
Deep down inside
That I've gotta find
Deep down inside
And only you can decide
We mean so much to each other
Now there's nothing more to hide
Never found no one to love us
Because it's been there
All the time
Right in front of our eyes
For all this time
We've been so blind
But baby now we see that
Friends can be lovers
Lovers can be friends
We can't fight emotion
When love can never end
Friends can be lovers
Right until the end of time
Better than the others
This we can't deny
Nothing can go wrong
Because we're keepin' love alive
Friends can be lovers
Right until the end of time
There's no mystery to this feeling
'cause it's been here all the time
And it's not so unusual
Just to hold it back
Until it shines
Until it's bright
Until it shines
From way down deep inside
Friends can be lovers
Lovers can be friends
We can't fight emotion
When love can never end
Friends can be lovers
Right until the end of time
Until the end of time
Until it shines
Until it's bright
Until it shines
From way down deep inside
And that's why
Friends can be lovers
Lovers can be friends
We can't fight emotion
When love can never end
Friends can be lovers
Right until the end of time
It's better than the others
This we can't deny
Nothing can go wrong
Keepin' love alive
Friends can be lovers... until the end of time
