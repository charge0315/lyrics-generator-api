You pushed me once too far again
I'd love to break your fuckin' teeth
I'd stick a knife in the center of your back
You better grow some eyes in the back of your head
I fight dirty, just like your looks
Can't take, can't take, can't take any more

Take back
Take back
Take...

Taste of bad blood on the tip of my tongue
An eye for an eye, a gun for a gun
Cold-cocked, I'm takin' back what's mine
Expect it when you're least expectin' it
No loss of love, the smell of regret
Lights out, I take, can't take any more

Take back
Take back
Take back
Take back

Shit!
