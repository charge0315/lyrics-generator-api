I was just thinking about you today
And the evening we slept in the mountains
But I cannot get through to you
Find words to say to you
Darling you're so far away
Oh no I'm not crying, these ain't tears in my eyes
I'm so happy I'm dying with laughter
If you'd only come over, I'm sure that you'd see
We're not lonesome, my cricket and me
Oh, your picture reminds me, I wanted to be free
I hurt you, I drove you away
If you'd just come back over I'm sure that you'd see
We're not lonesome, my cricket and me
We're not lonesome, my cricket and me
