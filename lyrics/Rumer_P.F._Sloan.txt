No no no no no no no no
Don't sing this song
No, don't sing this song
No no no no no no no no
Don't sing this song
It belongs to P.F. Sloan
I have been seeking P.F. Sloan
But no one knows where he has gone
No one ever heard the song
That boy sent winging
Now you might sigh
And you might moan
And sweat about the skin and bone
And you just smiled
And read the Rolling Stone
While he continued singing
Now listen to him singing
No no no no no no no no
Don't sing this song
No, don't sing this song
No no no no no no no no
Don't sing this song
It belongs to P.F. Sloan
Oh, from now on
Nixon's come and bound to stay
He's taken all my sins away
I heard it on the news today
But it set my ears to ringing
Can't you hear the people singing
No no no no no no no no
Don't sing this song
No, don't sing this song
No no no no no no no no
Don't sing this song
It belongs to P.F. Sloan
Oh, from now on
Last time I saw P.F. Sloan
He was summer burned and winter blown
But he turned that corner all alone
And he was singing
Listen to him singing
No no no no no no no no
Don't sing this song
No, don't sing this song
No no no no no no no no
Don't sing this song
It belongs to P.F. Sloan
Oh, from now on
No no no no no no no no
Don't sing this song
No, don't sing this song
No no no no no no no no
Don't sing this song
It belongs to P.F. Sloan
Oh, from now on
