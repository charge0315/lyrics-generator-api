A mutinous enemy carved a nascent country
Sweat, blood, and valor forms the grit of our history
Bequeathed to everyone: chance and free expression
Substance was restrained and the spirit was broken

I feel a strange denial
Rhythmic as a change, constant as time
Lonely Insistent whispers
Somber as a wave bye-bye

Searching for solution, without constitution
Blackcoats by our sides promising salvation
Advocating dogma as tickets to hereafter
Mortals in their prime with their desperate hands in the air

Daunting, complex and burning
Rhythmic as change, constant as time
Conflicts, craving approval
Weighted as a murder trial
Oh, I feel a strange denial

Correct is consensus; everything else, nonsense
Forward is the hope , forget recompense
Peace and tranquility is only for the wealthy
Dearth for the masses and inequality

I feel a strange denial
Rhythmic as a change, constant as time
Lonely, insistent whispers
Dissipating in the night
Like a lone, forgotten light

And no one is helping me
It's a strange denial
