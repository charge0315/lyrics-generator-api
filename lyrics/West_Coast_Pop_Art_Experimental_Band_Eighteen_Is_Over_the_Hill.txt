Antique white lace
A plastic face
A tinfoil place
An empty space
You're so hung up on yourself
And nothing else

I like too much the rain
The power of my brain
The sunshine and the open road
Ahead of me

Laughing because
It's right to laugh
Dress up at night
In the right dress
You can't change me
Into something that I'm not

I like too much the rain
The power of my brain
The sunshine and the open road
Ahead of me

I'll hear your line
Some other time
When miming
Performance rhyme
The way you feel
It is so phony and unreal

I like too much the rain
The power of my brain
The sunshine and the open road
Ahead of me
I like too much the rain
The power of my brain
The sunshine and the open road
Ahead of me
