Hey, hey, hey, here I go now

Ain't no mercy there for me
Hey, hey, hey, ain't no mercy

Do you bury me when I'm gone?
Do you teach me while I'm here?
Just as soon as I belong
Then it's time I disappear

Hey, yeah, yeah

And I went on down that road
Hey, hey, hey, and I went on

I'm pain, I'm hope, I'm suffer
Hey, hey, hey, yeah, and I went on
And I went on down that road

Do you bury me when I'm gone?
Do you teach me while I'm here?
Just as soon as I belong
Then it's time I disappear
Do you bury me when I'm gone?
Do you teach me while I'm here?
Just as soon as I belong
Then it's time I disappear
Disappear

I'm gone, I'm gone
I'm gone, I'm real gone
I'm gone, I'm gone, baby
I'm gone, I'm gone

Do you bury me when I'm gone?
Do you teach me while I'm here?
Just as soon as I belong
Then it's time I disappear
Do you bury me when I'm gone?
Do you teach me while I'm here?
Just as soon as I belong
Then it's time I disappear
Disappear
