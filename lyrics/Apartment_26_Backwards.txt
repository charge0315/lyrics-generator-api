Finished looking for the answers
Now I'm looking for the questions
I can look into your mirror and see inside your head
See my reflections and this is what I've bled
I look right into your mirror but I can't see me
Chorus:
Everything's gone backwards
Nothing's what it seems
I awake from my nightmares
Smash the mirrors, smash the dreams
Backwards into future
Now you're making up for lost time
I hide under the shadow and try to hide my name
Eyes that will question and this is what I mean
I look back into your mirror
But I still don't see me
