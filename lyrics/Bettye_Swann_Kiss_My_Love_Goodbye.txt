I don't wanna hear it
There's nothing to say
Ain't no use in your sweet talking, boy
Just  out of my way
I knew you'd deny it
So I'm not surprised
I may have believed you again
But I saw you with my own eye

I admit you were slick, oh baby
You sure played it cool
I may be a little slow learning
Buy mama didn't raise no fool
No she didn't
The taxi is waiting
I've heard your sad song
About the time you realise I'm leaving
That's the time I'll be long gone

So you can kiss my love goodbye
You can kiss my love goodbye
It's a cold cold day to you know where
You can kiss my love goodbye

I admit you were slick, oh baby
You sure played it cool
I may be a little slow learning
Buy mama didn't raise no fool
No she didn't
A taxi is waiting
I've heard your sad song
About the time you realised I'm leaving
That's the time I'll be long gone

So you can kiss my love goodbye
You can kiss my love goodbye
Till it's a cold cold day and you know where
You can kiss my love goodbye
So  kiss my love goodbye
You can kiss my love goodbye
Till it's a cold cold day and you know where
You can kiss my love goodbye
