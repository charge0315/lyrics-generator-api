Tahj Money

I don't know shit bout no 'murda, gotta keep my mouth closed
Just got a brand new Desert Eagle wit' a cutter that fold
Shower and Bleach rip up the car
Make sure you burn all the clothes
My youngin' down to shoot to kill just for a line of some coke
Send a text to all the opps like, yeah we want all the smoke
We up by 6, they down by 2, they need to go fix the score
Hop out wit' poles told 'em I won't spare no kids or no hoes
Foot on the petal, heavy metal, send some shots through your clothes

Take off his nose, none of my niggas gone bend, break, or fold
Clutchin' cutters, me and my brothers riding round smokin' dope
I gotta drop on all the opps, hope you don't think that you low
This ain't no threat bitch this a promise when I catch you case-closed
Money fold, dope sold, you caught a body but told
Spent fourty-thousand on some diamonds, got my mouth lookin' froze
We sippin' lean, that's not prescription got 'em comin by loads
Lord knows, walk in the mall and spend ten thousand on clothes

I don't know shit bout no 'murda, gotta keep my mouth closed
Just got a brand new Desert Eagle wit' a cutter that fold
Shower and Bleach rip up the car
Make sure you burn all the clothes
My youngin' down to shoot to kill just for a line of some coke
Send a text to all the opps like, yeah we want all the smoke
We up by 6, they down by 2, they need to go fix the score
Hop out wit' poles told 'em I won't spare no kids or no hoes
Foot on the petal, heavy metal, send some shots through your clothes

I bought a chopper than I filled it up
I catch 'em, I'ma fill 'em up
Walk, Nine headshots
Hit the corner, rip you up
Y'all better listen to the words I say
We livin' in our last days
Point-blank proven
Ci-Cigarettes and ash-treys

I don't know shit bout no 'murda, gotta keep my mouth closed
Just got a brand new Desert Eagle wit' a cutter that fold
Shower and Bleach rip up the car
Make sure you burn all the clothes
My youngin' down to shoot to kill just for a line of some coke
Send a text to all the opps like, yeah we want all the smoke
We up by 6, they down by 2, they need to go fix the score
