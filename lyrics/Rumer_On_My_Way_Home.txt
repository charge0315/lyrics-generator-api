Full of sorrow, I must have followed you here
Stood at the gates of Heaven, I watched you disappear
Now I hear you say
"It's time to walk away"
How can I when I don't know my way home from here?
Out of nowhere, I'm on the side of the road
I must have cut my heart out
I must have sold my soul
As I turned my weary head towards the desert sky
As your last light faded from view
And I knew I was lost
I was on my way, on my way
On my way home
I was on my way, on my way
On my way home
When I was hiding from the storms, you heard me calling out
Where were you?
With every demon on the road, you had me crying out
Where were you?
You know I've searched the stars
I don't know where you are
Oh, on my way, on my way
On my way home
Oh, on my way, on my way
On my way home
When I wake up, I see a fire red sky
And I get my down on my knees and praise in disbelief
Is this beauty laid before my eyes?
And it feels so strong
And it feels so warm
Oh, my God; oh, my God
I am yours
Oh, my God; oh, my God
I am yours
