If you've found your hair's got longer
Just go down to the hairdresser
He'll fix your hair and he makes you wonder
What you're gonna do for dinner
Take the time to take a rest
And don't be afraid to look on down
Mind your business and don't get me wrong
Because I don't give a damn'
Does anybody feel the same I do today?
I feel so strong inside
