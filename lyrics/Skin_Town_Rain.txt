I call but then hang up
Too much fear
Too little hope
All my life, all my death
All my angels, all my demons
My belief, unfaith
My family, friends
Tragedy, lies, sadness
Lust, fear, rebellion
All just a-sin-de-ton
I'm a broken object
Objective, methodical, demonical
You say you love me, but--
'Tis the end
It's goodbye
Not as planned
I can't try
