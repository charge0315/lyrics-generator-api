Baby, oh, baby
I love to call you baby
Baby, oh, oh, baby
I love for you to call me baby
When you squeeze me real tight
You make wrong things right
And I can't stop loving you
And I won't stop calling you
Baby (Baby), oh baby
You look so good to me, baby
Baby (Baby), oh baby
You are so good to me, baby
Just one look in your eyes
And my temperature goes sky-high
I'm weak for you and can't help it
You know I really don't want to help it
B-A-B-Y, baby
B-A-B-Y, baby
Whenever the sun don't shine
You go out to light my hind
Then I get real close to you
And your sweet kisses see me through
I said, baby (Baby), oh baby
You look so good to me, baby
Baby (Baby), oh baby
How I love for you to call me baby
When you squeeze me real tight
You know you make wrong things right
And I can't stop loving you
And I won't stop calling you
Baby (Baby), oh baby
He's so sweet, he's my B-A-B-Y, baby
I like it, I like it, I like to call him B-A-B-Y, baby
I said I like it, I like it, I like to call him
