Ooh, hey
Ooh, hey
I left my heart in another's hands
I watched my well run dry
I swear at times I don’t understand
Why I feel the need to testify

Do, do, do, do, do, do, do
To prove my love
Do, do,do, do, do, do, do
To prove my love
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do
To prove my love
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do
To prove my love

I've done my time in another's mind
(Tell me, tell me)
I’ve rolled the clouds away
(All right)
I swear at times I can see right through
But just can't seem to make it stay, yeah
(Tell me, tell me)

Do, do, do, do, do, do, do
To prove my love (Prove my love)
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do
To prove my love
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do
To prove my love (Prove my love)
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do
To prove my love

Ooh, hey (Work it, work it)
Ooh, hey (Work it, work it)
I mapped a course through the track of space
(Tell me, tell me)
It brought me straight to you
(It's all right)
I swear at times I don't comprehend
(Tell me, tell me)
But I know I've got to see it through, yeah

Do, do, do, do, do, do, do
To prove my love (Prove my love)
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do
To prove my love
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do
To prove my love (Prove my love)
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do
To prove my love
