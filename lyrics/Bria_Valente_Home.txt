Came down to find you here celebrating all alone
Traveling in a caravan of ice tears
I come to claim you all for my own
Of course your scared the first time I appear
'Cause many seek your throne
There's no need to worry, no need to fear
You just feel at home
At home
Home
And, I came down you up in arms
A house full of thieves and liars
Rest this heart so easily charmed
Gon' end up in a bed of fire, ooh
Of course you scared the first time I save
Let help tap on that door
There's no need to run from your one and only desire
I come to bring peace to your home
Your home
Your home
I came down to hear you say
That at last your finally satisfied
There was never any other that could ever be your lover
And truly get inside
Touch the core we all live for
Everlasting paradise
You see that in your life there are many houses
But now you finally got a home
A home
A home, okay
I only wanna cleanse your feet with iciest tears and make you feel at home
I only wanna cleanse your feet with iciest tears and make you feel at home
Home
Home
Feel at home
Come home
