(Chorus:)
Get your money baby!
Get your money baby!
Get your money baby!
Get your money baby!
If you strippin' I ain't trippin'
If it's alright with ya, it's alright with me
(Verse 1:)
She's a single momma, makin' dollars
Cabaret and make you holla
Lookin' lovely, day, and nightly
Makin' hubbies leave they wifey
Homewrecker; heartbreaker; love to shake her money maker
She's too sexy for her clothes, so she throws them on the floor
She danger, she danger
What y'all wanna do, fall in love?
She just handlin' business
Go 'head girl but don't work your stuff
(Chorus:)
Get your money baby!
Get your money baby!
Get your money baby!
Get your money baby!
If you strippin' I ain't trippin'
If it's alright with ya, it's alright with me
It's alright
It's alright
It's alright
It's alright
It's alright
It's alright
It's alright
(Verse 2:)
She's drop dead intelligent
Her fragrance is that stripper scent
Browses popping to bongo
We thongses drop to 50 Cent
Private dancer, bubble twister
Just be glad she ain't your sister
Hands off her you can't touch her
Fall in love, and she bound to crush ya
She danger, she danger
What y'all want? She truly hood
She just handlin' business
Go 'head girl go (Cut)
(Breakdown:)
I ain't mad, I ain't mad
I ain't mad at ya, I ain't mad
'Cause girl you bad, girl you bad
You doin' your thang, and your work is this
When you work out
(Verse 3:)
When you drop your bubble low
Girl I'll give it up and I'll clap
When you crawlin' on the flo'
Girl I clap
(Chorus:)
Get your money baby!
Get your money baby!
Get your money baby!
Get your money baby!
If you strippin' I ain't trippin'
If it's alright with ya, it's alright with me
(Verse 4:)
When you work it, work it, work it
Girl when you work it
Please don't hurt me, hurt me, hurt me
Hurt me, don't hurt me
When you drop it, drop it, drop it
Pop it and drop it
Take it easy, easy, easy
Easy, go easy
Because you bad girl, bad girl
Dynamite (Dynamite)
That's right
That's right
That's right
Because you bad girl, bad girl
Dynamite (Damn right I'm bad) *echo*
(Chorus:)
Get your money baby!
Get your money baby!
Get your money baby!
Get your money baby!
If you strippin' I ain't trippin'
If it's alright with ya, it's alright with me
