You've got a habit of leaving me
You've got a habit of deserting me
Sometimes I cry
Sometimes I'm so sad
Sometimes I'm so glad, so glad
You could grow up if you wanted to, wanted to, wanted to
Wanted to
Wanted to
You've got a habit of leaving me
You've got a habit of deserting me
Sometimes I cry
Sometimes I'm so sad
Sometimes I'm so glad, so glad
You could grow up if you wanted to, wanted to, wanted to
Wanted to
Wanted to
