Should auld acquaintance be forgot
And never brought to mind?
Should auld acquaintance be forgot
And auld lang syne!

For auld lang syne, my dear
For auld lang syne
We'll take a cup o' kindness yet
For auld lang syne
For auld lang syne

10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1

Should auld acquaintance be forgot
And never brought to mind?
Should auld acquaintance be forgot
And auld lang syne!

For auld lang syne, my dear
For auld lang syne
We'll take a cup o' kindness yet
For auld lang syne
For auld lang syne
For auld lang syne, my dear
For auld lang syne
We'll take a cup o' kindness yet
For auld lang syne
For auld lang syne

Ayy, oh yeah, ayy, ayy, hey
Happy New Year, baby
Ayy
4,3,2,1

Should auld acquaintance be forgot
And never brought to mind?
Should auld acquaintance be forgot
And auld lang syne!
Haha, does anybody really know the words? Hehe
Might as well sing along

Happy New Year, baby (Oh)
Happy New Year, baby

Should auld acquaintance be forgot
And never brought to mind?
Should auld acquaintance be forgot
And auld lang syne!

Happy New Year
To you and your friends
And have a drink on me
Happy New Year to you
And have a drink on me

10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1
Happy New Year!
