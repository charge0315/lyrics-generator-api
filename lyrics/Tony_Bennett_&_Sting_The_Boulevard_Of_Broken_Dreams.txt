I walk along the street of sorrow
The Boulevard of Broken Dreams
Where Gigolo and Gigelette can take a kiss without regret
So they forget their broken dreams

You laugh tonight and cry tomorrow
When you behold your shattered dreams
And Gigolo and Gigelette
Wake up to find their eyes are wet
With tears that tell of broken dreams

Here is where you'll always find me
Always walking up and down
But I left my soul bеhind me
In an old cathedral town

The joy that you find hеre you borrow
You can not keep it long it seems
But Gigolo and Gigelette
Still, sing a song and dance along
The Boulevard of Broken Dreams

The joy that you find here you borrow
You can not keep it long it seems
But Gigolo and Gigelette
Still, sing a song and dance along
The Boulevard of Broken Dreams
