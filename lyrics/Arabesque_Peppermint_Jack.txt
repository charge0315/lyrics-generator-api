Chorus:
Hey, Peppermint Jack
Hey, Peppermint Jack
Hey, Peppermint Jack
Your hair is gray
And your skin is black
Too old they say
So you got the sack
I recall that we used to buy
Pepperminds from a lovely guy
He had worked for Icecream Joe
Till he was told he had to go
He said to himself this wise old man:
"Ice is gonna melt but peppermint can't"
So he said to us when we came to school:
"Only peppermint really keeps you cool"
"Only peppermint really keeps you cool"
Chorus
Then one day he didn't appear
When we heard why, we were in tears
Poor old Jack, how little he earned
Went to the place of no return
With a piece of chalk we wrote on his stone:
"Ice is gonna melt, but peppermint won't"
Never more we heard when we came to school:
"Only peppermint really keeps you cool"
"Only peppermint really keeps you cool"
Chorus
Peppermint, peppermint, peppermint Jack
Peppermint, peppermint, peppermint Jack
Peppermint, peppermint, peppermint Jack
