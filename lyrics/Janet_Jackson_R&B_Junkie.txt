I feel like bumpin' to some old school
I feel like dancin' all night with you
I feel like bumpin' to some old school
I feel like dancin' all night with you

Time to set it off, we can bump, bump all night
Wanna get my freak on, DJ keep the party hype
Do the wop, don't you stop, or just smurf it left to right
We could bounce, skate and rock play that old school I like

Okay, here we go take it back, let's get it funky
I'm a R&B junkie, you know it babe
Groove me, on the floor like that music is bumpin'
Ride it get all up on it baby, ooh

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, tell me, can you keep it up?
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, till they kick us out the club
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, lookin' like you're havin' fun
You know how we do it's old school love, yeah baby

Time to set it off, we can bump, bump all night
Wanna get my freak on, DJ keep the party hype
Do the wop, don't you stop, or just smurf it left to right
We could bounce, skate and rock play that old school I like

Ooh babe, remember that was the jam
DJ is scratchin', I'm cabbage patchin', don't stop just get it, get it
Front, back, side to side when you slide, so electric
Love how you wreck it, yeah yeah yeah

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, tell me, can you keep it up?
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, till they kick us out the club boy
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, lookin' like you're havin' fun
You know how we do it's old school love yeah

Time to set it off, we can bump, bump all night
Wanna get my freak on, DJ keep the party hype
Do the wop, don't you stop, or just smurf it left to right
We could bounce, skate and rock play that old school I like

I feel like bumpin' to some old school
I feel like bumpin' to some old school
I feel like bumpin' to some old school
I feel like dancin', it's time to set it off

Time to set it off, we can bump, bump all night
Wanna get my freak on, DJ keep the party hype
Do the wop, don't you stop, or just smurf it left to right
We could bounce, skate and rock play that old school I like
