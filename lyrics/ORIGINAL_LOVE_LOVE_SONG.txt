:
This is a love song
Made up of moments
Of moment you and I
Have never known together
This is a love song
Composed of longings
And secret daydreams where
We swear to love forever
A song of laughter
And sweet desire
A secret melody in me
That you inspire
Since I first saw you
The song's been growing
And now that you are close
It's almost overflowing!
Come join the chorus!
Come sing beside me!
Come share my love song!
:
Keep it up, don't stop!
Make believe you're falling in love!
Passion!
Make believe you're burning with passion!
Keep it going
Keep it soaring
La di da di da di da di da dum!
On a morning!
Oh, how lovely!
Such emotion!
How romantic!
This is magic!
Can't you see the stage is changing?
:
Can it be it's me who's changing?
:
Can't you feel the fire igniting?
:
I believe I feel a spark!
Slowly rising
Slowly rising
Something deep inside
Is slowly rising
Tickling me
Tickling me
A tiny flame is tickling me
Slowly growing
Slowly growing
There's a sign of life that's slowly showing!
Tickling me
Tickling me
Inside my thighs, it's tickling me!
:
A song of laughter
And sweet desire
A secret melody in me
That you inspire
Since I first saw you
The song's been growing
And now that you are close
It's almost overflowing!
Come join the chorus!
Come sing beside me!
Come share my love song!
Love song!
:
Keep it up, keep it up, don't stop!
Now you're on your own!
:
A song of laughter
And sweet desire
A secret melody in me
That you inspire
:
Since I first saw you
The song's been growing
And now that you are close
It's almost overflowing!
Come join the chorus!
Come sing beside me!
Come share

My love song!

Love song!
:
Love song!
