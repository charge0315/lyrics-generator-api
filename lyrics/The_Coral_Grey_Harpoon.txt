Please don't let the light though my window
Keep the curtain shut, it brings me good luck
Please don't let the light through my window
Don't wanna see the day, I don't need it anyway

Please don't let the light through my window
Don't wanna see the shop or the wet bus stop
Please don't let the light through my window
The bells ring out for doom on this Sunday afternoon

Please don't let the light through my window
Please don't let the light through my window
Please don't let the light through my window
Please don't let the light through my window
Please don't let the light through my window
Please don't let the light through my window
Please don't let the light through my window
Please don't let the light through my window
Please don't let the light through my window
