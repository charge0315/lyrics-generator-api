Yesterday
All my troubles seemed so far away
Now it looks as though they're here to stay
I believe in yesterday
Suddenly
I'm not half the man I used to be
There's a shadow hanging over me
Yesterday came suddenly
Why she had to go, I don't know
She didn't say
I said something wrong, now I long
For yesterday
Yesterday
Love was such an easy game to play
Now I need a place to hide away
I believe in yesterday
Why she had to go, I don't know
She didn't say
I must have said something wrong, now I long
For yesterday
Yesterday
Love was such an easy game to play
Now I need a place to hide away
'Cause I believe in yesterday
How I long
For yesterday
