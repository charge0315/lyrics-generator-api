We've been searchin' up and down this weary country
Worn out, looking for ways that we can feed our hungry
We were told the streets were paved with gold
And the future would be ours to hold
But we've seen the dream get bought and sold

In the promised land
We don't wanna hear it anymore
'Cause the common man
Has heard all these promises before
In the promised land

We try to be faithful to our true convictions
But there's so much danger in the heart's addiction
We were told that we could have it all
Now our backs are up against the wall
As we stand looking at the rise and fall

In the promised land
We don't wanna hear it anymore
'Cause the common man
Has heard all these promises before

Smoldering ice
Concrete and steel
Rebuild the dream that no longer seems real
Tell me where did we go wrong
And what will it take
To heal this condition
Before it's too late

In the promised land
We don't wanna hear it anymore
'Cause the common man
Has heard all these promises before
In the promised land
In the promised land
In the promised land
In the promised land
In the promised land
In the promised land
In the promised land...
