Yea mon
There was once a friend of mine
Who wanted to go back home
Jamaica was where he lived
And he felt so alone
So he said to me one day
"My friend I must leave here soon
I must smell the warm sea air, and see the dropping moon"
So I say, "So Jah say, so Jah say, so Jah say"
So I said to him
My friend why you wanna go back there
Kingston is very bad
Revolution is in the air
But he said to me my friend
My woman she needs me now
And I need to see her face
And feel her body brown
So Jah say (when you going back to Kingston town)
So Jah say (when you going back to Kingston town)
So Jah say (when you going back to Kingston town)
So Jah say (when you going back to Kingston town)
Island girl
Im coming home
To be with you
Where I belong
So Jah say
So Jah say
So Jah say
Well my friend he did go back
And now hes dead and gone
The police they shot him dead
Said he was doing wrong
He was talking in the streets
The words of Bustanmante
But there was no Marcus Garvey
There to set him free
So Jah say (when you going back to Kingston town)
So Jah say (when you going back to Kingston town)
So Jah say (when you going back to Kingston town)
So Jah say (when you going back to Kingston town)
Island girl
Im coming home
To be with you
Where I belong
So Jah say (when you going back to Kingston town)
So Jah say (when you going back to Kingston town)
So Jah say (when you going back to Kingston town)
So (when you going back to Kingston town)
So Jah say (when you going back to Kingston town)
So Jah say (when you going back to Kingston town)
So Jah say (when you going back to Kingston town)
So Jah say (when you going back to Kingston town)
Eh
Eh
