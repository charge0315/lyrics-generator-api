Silent prayer

I send to you my silent prayer
Before I sleep at night
I send to you my silent prayer
Baby, so you'll be alright
Every morning I think of you
I just can't shake up my dreams, no, no
I read the paper and watch the news
I don't know what it means

When you do what you got to do
You must know that I'm there with you
Every breath that I take
I hope and I pray, sweet baby
Baby, we're okay
Silent prayer

(Silent prayer) Silent prayer
(Silent prayer) Silent prayer
(Silent prayer) I send to you my silent prayer

I hold a picture of a golden sunset
(Yeah)
And I'll take your hand
(Take my hand)
We're gonna walk down that promise road
Just like we planned
(Just like we planned)

'Cause I know what I'm gonna do
Just as soon as I'm back with you
Every breath that I take
I hope and I pray, sweet baby
Baby, we're okay
Silent prayer

(Silent prayer) Silent prayer
(Silent prayer) Silent prayer
(Silent prayer) I send to you my silent prayer

I send to you my silent prayer
I send to you my silent prayer
I send to you my silent prayer (Every hour)
My silent prayer

(Silent prayer) Silent prayer
(Silent prayer) Silent prayer
(Silent prayer) I send to you my silent prayer

Silent prayer
