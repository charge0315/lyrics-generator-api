Meet you in the closet
My lyrics hard like a faucet
Girl meet me by the doorstep

Girl we can a dream make call it Narnia
Hope you know I've always wanted ya
Understand that I'm touching ya
And I'm cutching ya
Girl we can make a dream call it Narnia
Hope you know I've always wanted ya
Understand that when I'm touching ya
And I'm cutching ya

We can make a dream call it Narnia
Make us a world, rap Sweatshirt Earl
We can make a dream call it Narnia
Make us a world, rap Sweatshirt Earl

Making a dream, taking the weed
You dating a fiend, but you got a Satan to please
I'll cut you the chase, like some cheese
And my name is Rhys so I'll give you a piece
Never pay for a lease, baby turn up the heat
You burning the D, turning on me
Learning to breathe, whilst taking the V
You want nothing but me
You're the something I need
You're cunning and sweet
So let's run up the street
Lemme tickle ya feet
Never pay for a feat
Never taking the shit
After every night you make me clean up the sheets
Just to stain the next night
So gimme you best fight
And I hope that you dress tight
Throw eggs at transvestites
You offer the sex, I
Can't refuse, I just guess, I
Love you so much I need you in the bed
You make my face turn red
We can do it in the shed
We still did it when you bled
You look like a sculpture, especially your head
Beating up the neighbourinos, call it Ned
Baby you heard what I said?
I'll even be next to you when you dead
Never gave a fuck 'bout cred
We'll just say fuck the respect
As we get back into bed
And we both light up like L.E.D

Meet you in the closet
My lyrics hard like a faucet
Girl meet me by the doorstep

Girl we can a dream make call it Narnia
Hope you know I've always wanted ya
Understand that I'm touching ya
And I'm cutching ya
Girl we can make a dream call it Narnia
Hope you know I've always wanted ya
Understand that when I'm touching ya
And I'm cutching ya

We can make a dream call it Narnia
Make us a world, rap Sweatshirt Earl
We can make a dream call it Narnia
Make us a world, rap Sweatshirt Earl
