I will protect you
Nothing can hurt you
No storm clouds gathering terrify
I am a mountain
Surrounded by your love
You are a mountain that dreams are made of
We fight for love
We fight for love
Fight for love
Somewhere... somehow... someone
Somewhere... somehow... someone
I fight with fire
As I watch them conspire
To blow my world apart
Between the light
And the endless night
You will always be in my heart
We fight for love
We fight for love
Fight for love
We fight for love
Somewhere... somehow... someone
Somewhere... somehow... someone
Somewhere... somehow... someone
Somewhere... somehow... someone
Somewhere... somehow... someone
Somewhere... somehow... someone
Somewhere... somehow... someone
Somewhere... somehow... someone
Somewhere... somehow... someone
Somewhere... somehow... someone
Somewhere... somehow... someone
