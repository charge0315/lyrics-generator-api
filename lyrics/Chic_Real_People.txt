Real people
I want to live my life
With some real people
Yeah, yeah, real people
I'm doggone gonna be with
Some real people

Throughout this great big world of ours
There are so many folks who just can't get involved
Now they receive you readily and will deceive you dreadfully
Oh, yeah, it's a reality
I'll just do my best, yeah, to to try and make all those
Phony relationships dissolve
Now I suppose they could help themselves
So I grow close to surround myself with love and humanity

And with the real people
I want to live my life
With some real people
Yeah, yeah, real people
I'm doggone gonna be with
Some real people

I don't think my emotions
Can stand all of this wear and tear
They say you control your own destiny
But I can't take them getting the best, they're getting the best of me
Spread out, give me some elbow room
And some place where I can disappear
I'm so tired of hypocrisy and why these folks even bother me
Please, just let me be

Be with some real people
I want to live my life
With some real people
Yeah, yeah, real people
I'm doggone gonna be with
Some real people
Be with some real people
I want to live my life
