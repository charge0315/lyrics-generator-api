He was always the toughest kid
But he never meant no harm
But looking back I could see his fate
Was tatooed on his arm
Walking throught the courtyard
Always there to be seen
He and little Janie
Together they were the king and queen
He was the only one, who ever really knew
He was the only one, what can we do
He was the only one, he always showed us how
He was the only one, where is he now
Three years later at the bus stop
I know I'll never forget
He looked smaller and real wasted
As he bummed a cigarette
And I asked him what he'd been doing
And how's little Janie anyway
Seems he was drunk
They had a fight
Janie got hurt and they took him away
He was the only one, who ever really knew
He was the only one, what can we do
He was the only one, he always showed us how
He was the only one, where is he now
I can still see him standing there
Just like yesterday
Leaning on a '56
Giving his secrets away
Is it any wonder
I feel a little lonely
He's not just the only one
He's the one and only
I heard about the accident
There's not much left to say
He wandered out in the middle of the freeway
It must have happened right away
And I thought about what a shame it was
Now that it's all said and done
And it may sound strange
But even now
He's still the only one
He was the only one, who ever really knew
He was the only one, what can we do
He was the only one, he always showed us how
He was the only one, where is he now
