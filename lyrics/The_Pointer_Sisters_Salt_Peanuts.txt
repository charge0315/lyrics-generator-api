I got me a man with such a crazy name
(Salt peanuts, salt peanuts)
The way he's got me actin', it's a cryin' shame
(Salt peanuts, salt peanuts)
He's got me like a baby in a candy store
(Salt peanuts, salt peanuts)
He's always somethin' I ain't tried before
(Salt peanuts, salt peanuts)
I didn't know he'd be this way
He didn't warn me
I'm movin' in to stay
I thought I might try him maybe once or twice
(Salt peanuts, salt peanuts)
And then I couldn't quit him 'cause it felt so nice
(Salt peanuts, salt peanuts)
Better listen little lady to the story that I'm layin' on you
Yes, it's true little lady and it happened to me
And it could happen to you
When I get to lovin' my brand-new man
(Salt peanuts, salt peanuts)
It's like eatin' salt peanuts from a gallon can
(Salt peanuts, salt peanuts)
Never gets empty, never leaves me flat
(Salt peanuts, salt peanuts)
And my man's lovin' is a lot like that
Gotta tell ya what the fella tries to sell ya
Will impel ya to be totally free ya see
But when he's packin' it up and headin' for the door
You gonna be dyin', really dyin'
I can tell you now the man is leavin' you cryin' out for more
(Salt peanuts, salt peanuts)
He doesn't have to worry, honey, that's for sure
(Salt peanuts, salt peanuts)
When you see a chance and grab it don't you see you chance a habit
Habit forming, heard my warning, overnight you're hooked by morning
Never had time to stop and wonder why
Don't split, can't quit
After one taste it's a waste of time to try
Girls, you better remember what I told ya
When you see this man a-comin', you better start in runnin'
You better hope he misses 'cause if he kisses you
That's all she wrote
You kiss and you kiss and you kiss and you kiss and again
This time you know you really went and did it
And quittin' wouldn't get it
You couldn't even if you wanted to
Once upon a time I had it made up in my mind
That I could get along fine without it
When I finally got the news
There was nothin' left to lose
That's enough so sing the blues about
I've said just about everything I can say
So come on in girl take it away
You know I love you pretty baby
In the special kind of way a miner feels about his gold
And you know the day you left me, well baby let me say
You left me out in the cold
A sleepless night, hum along with a neon light
And in the mornin' when I wake you I really get to shakin'
Breakin' habits isn't easy to do
I gotta tell ya that I didn't know he'd be this way
Never heard a word about him before
So, I guess I'll gather up my trinkets and my clothes
And go and find out where his place is
And move in all of my cases
I wanna see if he could let me make him comfortable
And bring his slippers and his pipe right to his chair
When he comes home from the store
Yes, and then I'm callin' in a man to change the lock on the door
Got a habit that I need
I got a habit
I really got a habit
You certainly can't expect a girl like me to live without what I need
That's the kind of thing I couldn't do without you
I need you
That's how I'm thinking about you
I could never make it without you
And if I should ever doubt you
Then you'd be allowed to throw me out of the door
Once more
A bad habit, I gotta try and grab it whenever I can
They tell me the first one's always free
You pay for the other one, and then comes another one
By that time the money's up on your back, Jack
Gotta get back, but I hope you'll give a listen
To the drummer while he fills in all the pieces that are missin'
And that's all I got to say
When you see a chance and grab it don't you see you chance a habit
Habit forming, heard my warning, overnight you're hooked by morning
Never had time to stop and wonder why
Don't split, can't quit
After one taste it's a waste of time to try
Girls, you better remember what I told ya
When you see this man a-comin', you better start in runnin'
You better hope he misses 'cause if he kisses you
That's all she wrote
You kiss, and you kiss, and you kiss him again
This time you know you really went and did it
And quittin' wouldn't get it
You couldn't even if you wanted to
Once upon a time I had it made up in my mind
That I could get along fine without it
When I finally got the news
There was nothin' left to lose
That's enough so sing the blues about
I've said just about everything I can say
So come on in girl take it away
I got me a man with such a crazy name
(Salt peanuts, salt peanuts)
The way he's got me actin', it's a cryin' shame
(Salt peanuts, salt peanuts)
He's got me like a baby in a candy store
(Salt peanuts, salt peanuts)
He's always somethin' I ain't tried before
(Salt peanuts, salt peanuts)
Take one, have two
Don't mind if I do
Have a few
 salt peanuts
(Salt peanuts, salt peanuts)
