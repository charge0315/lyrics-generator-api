Watch me now
Feel the groove
Into something
Gonna make you move

Here we come
On the run
Don't know what
We're running from

Day or night
Black or white
Dance or sing
You gotta do your thing
You gotta do your thing

Peace will come
This world will rest
Once we have
Togetherness

Day or night
Dynamite
We had fun
But it's just begun
It's just begun
It's just begun

It's just begun, it's just begun
It's just begun, it's just begun
It's just begun, it's just begun
It's just begun, it's just begun
It's just begun, it's just begun
It's just begun, it's just begun
It's just begun, it's just begun
It's just begun, it's just begun
It's just begun, it's just begun
It's just begun, it's just begun
It's just begun, it's just begun
It's just begun, it's just begun
It's just begun, it's just begun
It's just begun, it's just begun
It's just begun, it's just begun
