There's a mickie in the tasting of disaster
In time (In time) – you get faster
Harry Hippie is a waste as if he has'ta
Procrasti––inatin'
Something moving in the brain of a doer
In time (In time) – feel a little newer
I switched from coke to pep and I'm a connoisseur
Mmm-hmm ('Bout time)

'Cause there's a method in the madness of the thinking
In time (In time) – "Oh we oughta..."
It seems the best of all the sadness is a sinkin'
In time (In time) – muddy water
And there's a wreck yard in the mind of a quitter
In time (in time) – gonna git bitter
He don't give a heck or is he blind and makin' litter?
In time ('Bout time) – gonna need a babysitter

Ahh, I felt so good, I told the leader how to follow
In time (In time) – git down
So glad I could not feel indeed so very hollow
No need – to follow
Our insecurities attracting every flirter
In time (In time) – yeah, it's murder
If you don't mind, please, why give slack to a deserter?
In time ('Bout time)

Well, well, o well, well, o – daylight is all I see
Ahhh, stay light – and wait for me
Whoa, whoa, whoa-whoa
See you – tomorrow noon
(Miss me) Hi! – (I'll see you soon)

Well, well – I told you, it's not the teachin', it's the learning
In time (In time) – don't need no burning
When I mold you to start reaching in the mornin'
In time
Well, well, there's a feeling oh so real in every human
On time ('Bout time) – hah-hah-ooh-ooh
There's a reeling when you don't know what you're doing
On time ('Bout time) – haaay, hey

Stay around to get a show – haaay, hey
(In time) Don't you know
Two years, too long to wait
Ha-aah – two words, get it straight
(In time) – Ya see an answer
In time (In time) –
And that ain't nothing, I'm a dancer
Ohh! Two years, too long to wait
Oh!! (Two words, uh–get it straight)
(Two years, too long to wait)
(Two words, uh–get it straight)
Ah, yessir, yessir, yeah
(Two years, too long to wait)
(Two words, uh–get it straight)
In time, in time
(Two years, too long to wait)
(Two words, uh–get it straight)
