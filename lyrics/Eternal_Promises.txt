Been around the world
Seen all I can see through the look in your eye
Touch my hand and I cry
Why baby, can't I feel this way all the time?
Looking out the window, I feel so distant from you
There's so much I can give you
Just give me a chance
To show you my love and affection
Baby let's start again and prove our love
'Cause if it's wrong or right this is how I feel
I know I can make things right
You promise me always to be there through thick and thin
Been around the world
Seen all I can see through the look in your eye
Touch my hand and I cry
Why baby, can't I feel this way all the time?
When our bodies are united
It gives me peace and joy and brings me sweet memories
The promises you made don't mean anything any more
Baby let's start again and prove our love
'Coz if it's wrong or right this is how I feel
I know I can make things right
Baby let's start all over again, I'll try
Been around the world
Seen all I can see through the look in your eye
Touch my hand and I cry
Why baby, can't I feel this way all the time?
Said we'd spend all our lives
Making plans that would last all the time, oh
There are no guarantees, my life is full of surprises
Been around the world
Seen all I can see through the look in your eye
Touch my hand and I cry
Why baby, can't I feel this way all the time?
