Hoo (*screams*)

Ah, tired of injustice
Tired of the schemes
The lies are disgustin'
So what does it mean? Damn it
Kickin' me down
I got to get up, ah
As jacked as it sounds
The whole system sucks, damn it
Hee, hoo-hoo (*screams*)

Peek in the shadow (Hoo-hoo!)
I come into the light (Hee-hee!)
If you tell me I'm wrong (Hee-hee!)
Then you better prove you're right
And you're sellin' out souls
But I, I care about mine
I've got to get stronger
And I won't give up the fight

With such confusions, don't it make you wanna scream? (Confusion, scream) (Make you wanna scream?)
Your bash abusin' victimize within the scheme
(Intrusion, scheme) (Hoo!)
You try to cope with every lie they scrutinize (Ooh, wow-wah, ooh, wow-wah)
Somebody, please have mercy (Ooh, wah)
'Cause I just can't take it

Stop pressurin' me
Just stop pressurin' me
Just stop pressurin' me
Make me wanna scream (
Hee, hee!
)
Ah, well stop pressurin' me
Just stop pressurin' me (
You just stop it, baby
)
Stop pressurin' me
Make me wanna scream (
You just, you just
)

I was disgusted by all the injustice
All the injustice,
