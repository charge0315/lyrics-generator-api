Yeah, uh!
Get up, now!
Ow!
Knock me out, yeah!

Wow!
Super highways, coast-to-coast
Easy to get anywhere
On the transcontinental overload
Just slide behind the wheel
How does it feel?

(When there's no destination) That's too far
And somewhere on the way
You might find out who you are
Wow!

(Living in America) Wow! Eye to eye, station to station
(Living in America) Hand to hand, across the nation
(Living in America) Got to have a celebration

Rock my soul, huh
Ah! Huh

Smokestack, fatback
Many miles of railroad track
All night radio, keep on runnin' through
Your rock 'n' roll soul
All-night diners keep you awake, hey
Hey, on black coffee and a hard roll, woo!

(You might have to walk the fine line) Say it
(You might take the hard line)
But everybody's working overtime

(Living in America) Huh, eye to eye, station to station
(Living in America) Hand to hand, across the nation
(Living in America) Yeahh! Got to have a celebration
Yow!

I (I live in America) help me out
But I (I live in America)
Wait a minute

You might not be looking for the promised land
But you might find it anyway
Under one of those old familiar names
Like New Orleans (New Orleans)
Detroit City (Detroit City), Dallas, huh (Dallas)
Pittsburgh, P.A. (Pittsburgh, P.A.)
New York City (New York City)
Kansas City (Kansas City)
Atlanta (Atlanta), Chicago and L.A

(Living in America) Hit me
(Living in America) Yeah, I walk in and out
(Living in America)
Yow!

(I live in America) Right here, dig my mess
(I live in America) Say it, I, I

(Living in America) Eddie Murphy, eat your heart out
(Living in America)
(Living in America) Yeah
Hit me, yeah, hit me now
(Living in America)
(Living in America) Wow!
I live in America
Paying' the time makes the crime, ooh
I live in America
Hey, I know what it means
(Living in America) Hit me
I said now, eye to eye, station to station
(Living in America) I'm gonna scream, let me, wow!
(Living in America) Ahh, yes, sir
Now ain't it funky?
(Living in America) Wow! So nice with your bad self
(Living in America) Wow, I feel good!
