Shooby-dooby-doo-doo-doo (All, all alone)
Shooby-dooby-doo-doo-woo-ooh (All a-, all alone) (All alone)
(Right here)

I saw you jump up, you and your friends, baby
And I heard you say they're playin' your jam (There's a jam right here, baby)
So wavin' your hand from side to side sugar
Hear you're claimin' you're a certified man (Certified)

I know it might sound strange
But I pictured us alone
And you're kissin' me in ways I can't tell (No)
If my thoughts of you are true
Then I wanna get with you
So I'll step in while I'm given the chance (Yeah)

Do you have a girlfriend? (Do you have a girlfriend?)
You're lookin' real cool (You're lookin' real cool)
Can I have your number? (Can I have your number?)
You don't have a thing to lose
Do you have a minute? (Do you have a minute?)
What is on your mind? (What is on your mind?)
I was just thinkin' (I was just thinkin')
We can spend some time

Shooby-dooby-doo-doo-woo-ooh (Are you all alone?) (All- all alone)
Shooby-dooby-doo-doo-doo (All- all alone)
Shooby-dooby-doo-doo-woo-ooh (Are you- are you all alone?) (All- all alone)

Heard a slow song, you don't waste time, baby
And you asked me if I wanted to dance (Sure, I wanna dance)
Playin' hard to get takes too long, sugar
So I told my friends that I found a man (You're the one)

I know it might sound strange
But I pictured us alone
And you're kissin' me in a-ways I can't tell (No)
If my thoughts of you are true
Then I wanna get with you
So I'll step in while I'm given the chance (Yeah)

Do you have a girlfriend? (Do you have a girlfriend?)
You're lookin' real cool (You're lookin' real cool)
Can I have your number? (Can I have your number?)
You don't have a thing to lose
Do you have a minute? (Do you have a minute?)
What is on your mind? (What is on your mind?)
I was just thinkin' (I was just thinkin')
We can spend some time

(Do ya, do ya, do ya have a girlfriend?)
You're lookin' real cool
(Do ya, do ya, do ya have a minute?)
I was just thinkin'
(Do ya, do ya, do ya have a girlfriend?)
We could spend some time
(Do ya, do ya, do ya have a minute?)
(Are you all alone?) (A-ha, a-ha)

I know it might sound strange
But I pictured us alone
And you're kissin' me in a-ways I can't tell (No)
If my thoughts of you are true
Then I wanna get with you
So I'll step in while I'm given the chance (Yeah) (Ah, a-ha)
