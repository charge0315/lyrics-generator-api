Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh (Bow, b-bow, bow)

You've seen my show, you followed my tour
I heard you scream with eighty-thousand more
But tonight, I close out my tour in your room
Know I pull 'em out of the crowd, and guess who?
The band is in place, the cameras are set
I'll make sure we tape it so you don't forget
I'ma take control, take it slow, so don't move
It's 'bout to go down, so just wait for my cue

House lights go low
Spotlight up more
It's time, so
Sit back and enjoy the show

Time to close the curtains
Come on in, the stage is set
Before the show starts, mic check
Tonight is so exclusive, we should make it pay-per-view
Time to close the curtains
I only take requests from you
Just tell me what you want me to do
I promise you, you'll be screaming out "encore" when I'm through

Let's change the set, try some new steps
Let's take it somewhere we haven't been yet
It's gon' be kinda hard 'cause I can't always bring you
The crowd is screamin' out, "I want more," I hear you
How is your seat? Can you see everything?
Baby, I don't want you missin' a thing
I'ma dedicate this next one to you
'Cause you're my number one fan and I'm showing you love

House lights go low
Spotlight up more
It's time, so
Sit back and enjoy the show

Time to close the curtains
Come on in, the stage is set
Before the show starts, mic check
Tonight is so exclusive, we should make it pay-per-view
Time to close the curtains
I only take requests from you
Just tell me what you want me to do
I promise you, you'll be screaming out "encore" when I'm through

Now's the perfect time for an intermission
If you need somethin' to drink
Better get it right now (Right now)
Better break it down (Right now)
'Cause I don't wanna stop no more
Now I come upon the end of the show
Let me slow it down
I'm not ready to go
There's a finale, so don't open the door

Time to close the curtains (Close the curtains)
Come on in, the stage is set (Stage is set)
Before the show starts, mic check (Baby)
Tonight is so exclusive, we should make it pay-per-view (Ooh, ooh, huh)
Time to close the curtains (Oh)
I only take requests from you
Just tell me what you want me to do
I promise you, you'll be screaming out "encore" when I'm through (Oh, oh)

Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh (Bow, b-bow, bow)
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh (Bow, b-bow, bow)
