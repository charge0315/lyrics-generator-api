Truck on, truck on, truck on, truck on, tyke (Yeah!!)
Truck on, truck on, truck on, truck on, tyke (Yeah!!)

Oh tyke, baby
You a slender living lady
You're dynamite, yeah
You a Jeep mouth bouncer
You a right on dancer
Got gangster's legs, yeah
Like a song, I truck on

Truck on, truck on, truck on, truck on, tyke
Truck on, truck on, truck on, truck on, tyke

You a silver stud fender
I'm a jive brained bender
I'm everyone, yeah
You got electric deep in me
I'm a space-age cowboy
Ride dinosaurs, yeah
Like a song, I truck on

Truck on, truck on, truck on, truck on, tyke
Truck on, truck on, truck on, truck on, tyke

Oh tyke, baby
You a palomino lady
Cause you move a lot, yeah
People put you down
Cause you're too low on the ground
They can't hurt you though
Cause you're cosmic
Like a song, I truck on

Truck on, truck on, truck on, truck on, tyke
Truck on, truck on, truck on, truck on, tyke
Truck on, truck on, truck on, truck on, tyke
Truck on, truck on, truck on, truck on, tyke
Truck on, truck on, truck on, truck on, tyke
Truck on, truck on, truck on, truck on, tyke
Truck on, truck on, truck on, truck on, tyke
Truck on, truck on, truck on, truck on, tyke
