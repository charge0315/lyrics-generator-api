For all the years that I've known you, baby
I can't figure out the reason why, lately
You've been acting so cold
Didn't you say if there's a problem, we should work it out?
So, why you givin' me the cold shoulder now
Like you didn't even wanna talk to me, girl? Tell me
Okay, I know I was late again (Late again)
I made you mad and dinner's thrown in the bin
But why you makin' this thing drag on so long? I wanna know
I'm sick and tired of the silly games (Silly games)
Don't think that I'm the only one here to blame
It's not me who's been goin' round slamming doors

That's when you turned and said to me
"I don't care, babe, who's right or wrong
I just don't love you no more"

Rain outside my window, pouring down
What now? You're gone, my fault, I'm sorry
Feeling like a fool 'cause I let you down
Now it's too late to turn it around
I'm sorry for the tears I made you cry
I guess this time it really is goodbye
You made it clear when you said
"I just don't love you no more"

I know that I made a few mistakes
But never thought that things would turn out this way
Doesn't make sense to me now that you're gone (I see it all so clearly)
Me at the door with you in a state (In a state)
Giving my reasons but as you look away (Away)
I can see a tear roll down your face

That's when you turned and said to me
"I don't care, babe, who's right or wrong
I just don't love you no more"

Rain outside my window, pouring down
What now? You're gone, my fault, I'm sorry
Feeling like a fool 'cause I let you down
Now it's too late to turn it around
I'm sorry for the tears I made you cry
I guess this time it really is goodbye
You made it clear when you said
"I just don't love you no more"

Those simple words hit so hard
They turned my whole world upside down
Girl, you caught me completely off guard
On that night you said to me
"I just don't love you no more"

Rain outside my window, pouring down
What now? You're gone, my fault, I'm sorry
Feeling like a fool 'cause I let you down
Now it's too late to turn it around
I'm sorry for the tears I made you cry
I guess this time it really is goodbye
You made it clear when you said
"I just don't love you no more"
Rain outside my window, pouring down
What now? You're gone, my fault, I'm sorry
Feeling like a fool 'cause I let you down
Now it's too late to turn it around
I'm sorry for the tears I made you cry
