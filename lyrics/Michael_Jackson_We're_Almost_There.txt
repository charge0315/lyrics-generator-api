No matter how hard
The task may seem
Don't give up our plans
Don't give up our dreams
No broken bridges
Can turn us around
'Cause what we're searching for
Will soon be found

'Cause we're al-almost there
Just one more step (Almost there)
Just one more step
Don't give up, we're al-almost there ('Cause we're almost there)

(Look at the lovers)
Look at the lonely lovers (That didn't make it)
That didn't make it (The long, hard climb)
Life's long, hard climb
They just couldn't take it
Don't let it happen
To me and you
Hold on together, darling
We'll make it through
Darling, keep on reaching out for me
Keep on reaching
Do it for me, do it for me, 'cause baby

(We're almost there)
('Cause we're almost there)
('Cause we're almost there)

We're so close
I can taste it
A life so sweet
We can't afford to waste it
If you feel your hand
Slipping from mine
Just hold on tighter, darling
Keep on trying
Baby, do it for me (Let's make this climb together)
Do it, do it, do it, baby

(We're almost there)
Just one more step
Don't give up (We're almost there)
Just one more step
Baby, baby, don't give up ('Cause we're almost there)
Keep on, keep on
Just one more step (We're almost there)
'Cause we're almost there

Just one more step
'Cause we're almost there
We've come too far
To turn around
Keep on reaching
For higher ground
We've had our ups
And we've had our downs
Ain't lettin' nothin' in the world, darling
Turn us around
'Cause we're almost there
We're almost there
We're almost there
Everything we're looking for
We're almost there
Keep on reaching out for me
'Cause we're almost there, darling
We're almost there
We're almost there, darling
We're almost there
We're almost there
Ah, we're almost there
Babe, we're almost there
