She's a burglar
She broke into my mind
She's a burglar
Took everything she could find

She looked into my eyes
They came out from my socket
And just like that, my heart was gone
She put it in her pocket

She's a burglar
She broke into my mind
She's a burglar
Took everything she could find

I was standing helpless
Lost all my control
She smiled at me with honey lips
Then she stole my soul

She's a burglar
She broke into my mind
She's a burglar
Took everything shе could find

She's a burglar
She broke into my mind
Shе's a burglar
Took everything she could find

I held her in my arm
And heard her call my name
And while she sweet-talked me
She vandalised my brain

She's a burglar
She broke into my mind
She's a burglar
Took everything she could find

She's a burglar
The woman broke into my mind
She's a burglar
Somebody ought to arrest that woman
She's a burglar
She went on and vandalised my mind
She's a burglar
Took everything...
