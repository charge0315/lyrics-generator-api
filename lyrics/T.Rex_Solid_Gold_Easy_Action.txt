Hey hey hey, hey hey hey

Life is the same and it always will be
Hey hey hey
Easy as picking foxes from a tree
Hey hey hey

But I can't get no satisfaction
All I want is easy action
Hey hey hey
Hey hey hey

A stud is a lamb with the thoughts of a tiger
Hey hey hey
Who moves like a cat and knows how to ride her
Hey hey hey

I can't get no satisfaction
All I want is easy action, baby
Hey hey hey
Stroll on

I can't get no satisfaction
All I want is easy action
Hey hey hey
Hey hey hey

A woman from the east with her headlights shining
Hey hey hey
Eased my pain and stopped my crying
Hey hey hey

But I can't get no satisfaction
All I want is easy action, baby
Hey hey hey
Hey hey hey

And all my hair will keep her smiling
While wondrous walk and my telephone dialing

I can't get no satisfaction
All I want is easy action, baby
Hey hey hey
Hey hey hey

I know you're shrewd and she's a dude
But all I want is easy action
I know you're shrewd and she's a dude
But all I want is easy action
I know you're shrewd and she's a dude
But all I want is easy action, baby
Hey hey hey
Stroll on
Hey hey hey
Hey hey hey
Hey hey hey
Hey hey hey
Hey hey hey
Hey hey hey
