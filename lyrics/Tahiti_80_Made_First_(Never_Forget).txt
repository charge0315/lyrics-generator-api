I was sleeping in my own bed
With three fairies above my head
Contemplating the reason they were there
Oh power is the law you find out as you grow
But I've been waiting and waiting in vain
And there's still nothing new in my hands
Love is a state
I hope I'll never forget
If I could know my fate
Things would be nicer
Things would be nicer
I was standing among fifteen
They were all down on their knees
Trying to sing their troubles
Their troubles and their fear
Oh even if I wanna learn
How to avoid those fifteen girls
Still running faster than me
What am I doing here
Love is a state I hope
I'll never forget
(Never forget, never forget)
If I could know my fate
Things would be nicer
Things would be better
