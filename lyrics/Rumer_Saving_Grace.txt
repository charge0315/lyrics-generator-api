I was running out of cafe conversation
I was weary of fashion parade
And it seems like there's a whole lot of people
From out of town 'round here these days
And in the streets, the preachers say
"If you wanna go to Heaven, why don't you walk this way?"
All day I prayed for 5 o' clock
I'm thinking maybe I should quit this job
And as the lights turn on the corner, I see your face
And I light up like a child
'Cause you are the one who makes me see
You are my saving grace
You make me want to make me want to become
Become better
'Cause when you walked in, you truly changed my world
When you take my hand, you make me strong
And when I'm weary, I don't have to explain myself
When I crawl the stairs, you let me rest
I never thought I'd ever see the sun again
Bitterness was beating down my door
Now I'm picking up the telephone, I read your name
And I light up like a child
'Cause you are the one who makes me see
You are my saving grace
You make me want to make me want to become
Become better
'Cause when you walked in, you truly changed my world
When you take my hand, you make me strong
And when you want me, I'll be there, you know I will
Just take my hand and I'll make you strong
