A small boy walked down a city street
And hope was in his eyes
As he searched the faces of the people he'd meet
For one he could recognize
Brother, where are you?
They said you came this way
Brother, where are you?
They said you came this way
Looking for a soul brother all around him
Looking for a soul brother all around him
The eyes of the people who passed him by
Were cold and as hard as stone
The poor boy whimpered and began to cry
Because he was all alone
Brother, where are you?
They said you came this way, yeah
Brother, where are you?
They said you came this way
Looking for a soul brother all around him
Looking for a soul brother all around him
Now there are many who swear it's true
That brothers all we are
Yet it seems there are very few
Who will answer a brother's call?
Brother, where are you?
They said you came this way, yeah
Brother, where are you?
They said you came this way
Now there are many who will swear it's true
That brothers all we are
Yet it seems there are so few
Who will answer a brother's call?
Brother, where are you?
They said you came this way, yeah
Brother, where are you?
They told me you came this way
Looking for a soul brother all around him
(They said you came this way)
Looking for a soul brother all around him
(Said you came this way)
Looking for a soul brother all around him
(I know you came this way)
Looking for a soul brother all around him
(Oh, you came this way, I know you came this way)
Looking for a soul brother all around him
Looking for a soul brother all around him
Looking for a soul brother all around him
Looking for a soul brother all around him
Looking for a soul brother all around him
