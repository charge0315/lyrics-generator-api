Long lost, long lost lover of mine
I've been waiting, anticipating
The day you return
Long lost, long lost lover of mine
It's good to see you
I really need you here with me
I'm sorry for the things I did to you
I know now I acted like a fool (Like a fool)
How you feel? How's the world treat you?
Have you been lonely for me, too?
Why don't you come on home to me?
I need your loving
Baby, can't you see?
Long lost , long lost  lover of mine
I've been waiting , anticipating
The day you return
Long lost , long lost  lover of mine
It's good to see you
I really need you here with me
Now it's been so long since I talked to you
You sure got a lot of catching up to do
Now I know I ain't been doing so good
'Cause I ain't been in love like I should
If you would only come on home to me
This time we'll make it
Just you wait and see
Long lost , long lost  lover of mine
I've been waiting , anticipating
The day you return
Long lost,  long lost  lover of mine
It's good to see you
I really need you here with me
Long lost , long lost  lover of mine
Long lost , long lost  lover of mine
Long lost , long lost  lover of mine
