(I go crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy...)
Feeling Like I do
Nothing's going to change my mind
Girl, when I see you
Wanna lay my heart on the line
It's no infatuation
'Cause I feel it burning deep inside, come on
There's no need to fear
We can let our hearts collide
Attraction, reaction
When I lose control
(I go crazy, I just go crazy)
'Cause I love you too much
(I go crazy, 'cause I'm mad about you, girl)
And you've got to know
(And you save me, you just amaze me)
Girl, whenever we touch
(I'm so crazy, 'cause I'm bad without you, ooh)
(I go crazy, I just go crazy)
'Cause I love you too much
(I go crazy, 'cause I'm mad without you, girl)
Wanna let you know
(And you save me, you just amaze me)
Girl, whenever we touch
(I go crazy, 'cause I'm bad without you, ooh)
Every night and day
I imagine you into my future
You and I in love
Making dreams come true of us together
Girl, it makes me nervous
'Cause I know you're not my very own, not yet
Saw you yesterday
You were with somebody else
Distraction, reaction
When I lose control
(I go crazy, I just go crazy)
'Cause I love you too much
(I go crazy, 'cause I'm mad about you, girl)
Gotta let you know
(And you save me, you just amaze me)
Girl, whenever we touch
(I'm so crazy, 'cause I'm bad without you, ooh)
(I go crazy, I just go crazy)
'Cause I love you too much
(I go crazy, 'cause I'm mad without you, girl)
Wanna let you know
(And you save me, you just amaze me)
Girl, whenever we touch
(I go crazy, 'cause I'm bad without you, ooh)
Feeling like a child, I'm so free and wild with you
Then you walk away, tell me you can't stay
When I lose control
(I go crazy, I just go crazy)
'Cause I love you too much
(I go crazy, 'cause I'm mad about you, girl)
(And you save me, you just amaze me)
Girl, whenever we touch
(I'm so crazy, 'cause I'm bad without you, ooh)
(I go crazy, I just go crazy)
'Cause I love you too much
(I go crazy, 'cause I'm mad without you, girl)
Wanna let you know
(And you save me, you just amaze me)
Girl, whenever we touch
(I go crazy, 'cause I'm bad without you, ooh)
