Can anybody fly this thing
Before my head explodes or my head starts to ring?
We've been livin' life inside a bubble
We've been livin' life inside a bubble

Confidence in you is confidence in me
Is confidence in a high speed

Can anybody stop this thing
Before my head explodes or my head starts to ring?
We've been living life inside a bubble
We've been livin' life inside a bubble

Confidence in you is confidence in me
Is confidence in a high speed

In high speed
High speed

In high speed you on
In high speed you on
In high speed you on
High speed you on
