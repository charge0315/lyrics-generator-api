Girl, I really love the way you lookin' at me

Woah-woah, spendin' a lot tonight
Hopin' you stay tonight, endin' the party right
Woah-woah, take everythin' off your mind

Baby, I gotta have you, girl
Lemme get it, when I get it, if I get it, I'ma kill it

Baby, you so gifted when you kissin' on my lips
Then we be switchin' up positions, you ain't ever gotta slow down
I can be the, be the lover, lover of ya life
I just wanna be under the covers for the night
Back, back, back up, take a look around
Put your hands in the air like the ceiling's fallin' down

Take a chance with me
Girl, you know that I won't do you no harm
Oh, my love
You got my heart, heart, heart
Girl, you know we're meant to be, yeah
All this magic, we should wish on a star
