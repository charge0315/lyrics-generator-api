Everybody's looking at me
Feeling paranoid inside
When I step outside I feel free
Think I will find a place to hide

Tell me, people, am I going insane?
Insane?
Tell me, people, am I going insane?
Insane?

Everyday I sit and wonder
How my life with you used to be
And how I feel I'm going under
Now my life is hard to see

So tell me, people, am I going insane?
Insane?
Tell me, people, am I going insane?
Insane?

So I am telling all you people
Listen while I sing again
If I don't sound very cheerful
I think that I'm a schizo brain

So tell me, people, am I going insane?
Insane?
Tell me, people, am I going insane?
Insane?
Insane?
Insane?
