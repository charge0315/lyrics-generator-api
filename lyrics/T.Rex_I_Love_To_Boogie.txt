We love to boogie
We love to boogie
Jitterbug boogie
Bolan pretty boogie
We love to boogie, on a Saturday night

Belinda Mae Fender's got a Cadillac Bone
Jenny lost her cherry walking all the way home
The passion of the Earth, blasted its mind
Now it's neat, sweet, ready for the moon-based grind

We love to boogie
We love to boogie on a Saturday night
I said a-we love to boogie
We love to boogie
High school boogie
Jitterbug boogie
We love to boogie, on a Saturday night
Ah yeah!

You can rattlesnake out with the tailfeathers high
Jitterbug left and smiled to the sky
With your black velvet cape and your stovepipe hat
Be-bop, baby, the dance is where it at

I love to boogie
Yes, I love to boogie on a Saturday night
I said I love to boogie
I love to boogie
Jitterbug boogie
I love to boogie
I love to boogie, on a Saturday night

I love to boogie
I love to boogie
I love to boogie
I love to boogie
I love to boogie, on a Saturday night
Woah, I love to boogie
I love to boogie
Jitterbug boogie
Jitterbug boogie
I love to boogie
