The whole world feels a little bit more love
When Christmas comes, when Christmas comes
And everywhere that you go
There's people singing "Let It Snow"
And hanging up that mistletoe

And me and you gonna have ourselves a holiday
And we don't need nobody else to celebrate
And we gon' kiss our worries and our cares away
I can't wait

Because this Christmas time, get together
It's gonna be so nice
Better than ever
And baby you're the one special treasure
I can't wait to unwrap your love
Until Christmas comes

So many souls hurt
So many don't have enough
When Christmas comes, when Christmas comes
But baby if you spread love
Someday it might be enough
To heal each other one by one

And we gon' get together and rejoice and pray
And we gon' help the world become a better place
And we gon' sing and shout because the Savior reigns
So don't dismay

Because this Christmas time, get together
It's gonna be so nice
Better than ever
Because this gift of love lasts forever
The Lord makes our hearts open up
Soon as Christmas comes

It's gon' be alright
When Christmas comes
Oh, jingle all the way
Oh what fun

And we gon' reminisce about the good old days
And we gon' laugh together as the children play
And through the years it's always gonna be this way
Come what may

Because this Christmas time, get together
It's gonna be so nice
Better than ever
And baby you're the one that I treasure
I can't wait to unwrap your love
When Christmas comes
