She works hard for the money
So hard for it, honey
She works hard for the money
So you better treat her right
She works hard for the money
So hard for it, honey
She works hard for the money
So you better treat her right

I met her there in the corner stands
And she wonders where she is
And it's strange to her
Some people seem to have everything
Nine A.M. on the hour hand
And she's waiting for the bell
And she's looking real pretty
Just waitin' for her clientèle

She works hard for the money
So hard for it, honey
She works hard for the money
So you better treat her right
She works hard for the money
So hard for it, honey
She works hard for the money
So you better treat her right

Twenty-eight years have come and gone
And she's seen a lot of tears
Of the ones who come in
They really seem to need her there
It's a sacrifice, working day to day
For little money, just tips for pay
But it's worth it all
To hear them say that they care

She works hard for the money
So hard for it, honey
She works hard for the money
So you better treat her right

She already knows
She's seen her bad times
She already knows
These are the good times
She'll never sell out
She never will
Not for a dollar bill
She works hard

She works hard for the money
So hard for it, honey
She works hard for the money
So you better treat her right
Hard for the money
So hard for it, honey
She works hard for the money
So you better treat her right (All right)
She works hard for the money (Hard, hard, hard for the money)
So hard for it, honey (Hard, hard, hard for it, honey)
She works hard for the money
So you better treat her right
She works hard for the money (Hard, hard, hard for the money)
So hard for it, honey (Hard, hard, hard for it, honey)
Works so hard for the money...
