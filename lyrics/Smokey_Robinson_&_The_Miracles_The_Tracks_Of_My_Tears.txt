Do do doo do
Do do doo do
Do do doo do
Do do, doo doo doo doo

People say I'm the life of the party
'Cause I tell a joke or two
Although I might be laughing loud and hearty
Deep inside I'm blue

So take a good look at my face
You'll see my smile looks out of place
If you look closer, it's easy to trace
The tracks of my tears
I need you (need you)
Need you (need you)

Since you left me, if you see me with another girl
Seeming like I'm having fun
Although she may be cute, she's just a substitute
Because you're the permanent one

So take a good look at my face
You'll see my smile looks out of place
Yeah, look a little bit closer, and it's easy to trace
Oh, the tracks of my tears
Oh, I need you (need you)
Need you (need you)

Hey, yeah
(Outside) I'm masquerading
(Inside) My hope is fading
(Just a clown) Ooh yeah, since you put me down
My smile is my make up I wear since my break up with you

Baby, take a good look at my face
Ah, you'll see my smile looks out of place
Yeah, just look closer, and it's easy to trace
Oh, the tracks of my tears, baby, baby
Baby, take a good look at my face
Ooh yeah, you'll see my smile looks out of place
Look a little bit closer, it's easy to trace
Yeah, the tracks of my tears, oh, yeah
Baby, take a good look at my face, yeah
