Don't you forget the echoes of time
Won't you regret the losing of minds?
In my dreams I'm searching across the desert sands for you
Scimitar moon is guiding me close to your side

Voyage, voyage
Voyage, voyage

Wilderness to wilderness
I traveled from afar
On the soft wind of the Nadq came
Fragrance of Araar
Splendor of a thousand suns
Shone glory in my path
No love more pure and rage more fierce
Could still my beating heart

Voyage, voyage
Voyage, voyage

So, should I return to trace the shadows of my chases?
My steps will echo there from sand to stone
I will never let my eyelids close on empty spaces
My dreams will find the void with tales unknown

Know the mighty infinite obscures the far horizon
The whispered road I take will never bend
Alone, and will the wind return my story to its promise
Or will my story chase me to my end?

Aye hawa, mere dilbar
Ko mere pyar kay geet sunana
Tu hay meri manzil
Aur pyar mera musafir, musafir
Meri reshmi zulfain
Meri meri reshmi zulfain
Teri zanjeerain
Hamesha
Meri reshmi zulfain
Meri meri reshmi zulfain
Teri zanjeerain
Hamesha

Melodies unspoken
Flowing from the lotus of my heart
Ending where we start

Promises unbroken
Promising a never-ending fire
Of love beyond desire

Ending where we start
