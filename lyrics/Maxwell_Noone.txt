If I had to do it over, if I had to do it again
Oh, I would've known too and this would've never began (No, we would've never)
Oh, if I made you claustrophobic, picture if I gave you an inch
Oh, you'll never know this
But there's no one quite like, no one quite like you

I try to forget ya, but you're all I wanna do
Oh, I can do better
But there's no one quite like, no one quite like ya
I try to forget ya (Oh, yeah), but you're all I wanna do
Oh, I can do better
But there's no one quite like, no one quite like ya

If I made you love me again (If I made you love me again)
If I made you want it again, oh (If I made you want it again)
If I gave it, you probably wouldn't want it, babe
It's alright 'cause there's no one quite like you

I try to forget ya (Said I try, uh), but you're all I wanna do
Oh, I can do better (I can do better)
But there's no one quite like, no one quite like you (Oh, no, no)
I try to forget ya (Try to forget ya), but you're all I wanna do
Oh, I can do better (I can do better)
But there's no one quite like, no one quite like you (Oh)
I try to forget ya (Try to forget you), but you're all I wanna do
Oh, I can do better (I can do better)
But there's no one quite like, no one quite like you

I try to forget ya
But you're all I wanna do
Oh, I can do better
I try to forget ya, but you're all I wanna do
Oh, I can do better
But there's no one quite like, no one quite like you
I try to forget ya, but you're all I wanna do
Oh
