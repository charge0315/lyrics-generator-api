You stay on my mind
I'm under your spell
Until eternaty
I'm haunted by your love

You got me walking on air
People they stare
There's nothing that can compare
To what you're worth
I'm haunted by your love
I'm haunted by your love
I'm haunted by your love
I'm haunted by your love
Never felt this way before
