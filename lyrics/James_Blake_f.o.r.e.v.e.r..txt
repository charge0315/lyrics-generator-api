Don't use the word, "Forever"
We live too long to be so loved
People change and I can be tethered
We think we are the only ones
You can't walk the streets a ghost anymore
You can't walk the streets a ghost anymore
Days form like new figures down my road
Each one looks more like you than you know
Beauty always in the last
You always landed on your feet in the past
While you were away, there was nothing to see
There's a mirror in my room I never used
While you were away, I started loving you
Oh, loving you
And I noticed I can still ghost the streets
And I noticed I can still ghost the streets
I noticed I can still ghost the streets
Noticed just how slow the killer bee's wings beat
And how wonderful, how wonderful
How wonderful you are
