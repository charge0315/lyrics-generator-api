Hey, baby, where you goin'?
No, please don't rush off so soon
If you leave me like this
I don't know what I'm gonna do

Finally, my eyes are open
I dream about you all night long
The only thing that I've been hopin' for
Is 'fore you to go to work, babe, we get it on
I ain't tryin' to make you blush, but I just wanted to tell ya
I think you're great
I know you're late, but I need another taste
Breakfast can wait

Grits and gravy (Grits and gravy)
Cheese eggs and jam
Can't nobody cook it like you, girl
No ma'am
This here early morning, need something else on my plate
I think I want another bite of you, babe
Breakfast can wait

Breakfast can wait
You really put it on me
You shut it down last night (Shut it down)
I thought the police was gonna come
(Was it loud?) Loud? Yeah, quite
Yeah, I ain't tryin' to make you blush
I just think you're great
Ain't no need to rush
Breakfast can wait

Finally, my eyes are open
I dream about you all night long
The only thing that I've been hopin' for
Is 'fore you to go to work, babe, we get it on
I ain't tryin' to make you blush, but I just wanted to tell ya
I think you're great
I know you're late, but I need another taste
Breakfast can wait

Hotcakes smothered in honey (Wait a minute)
I'm gon' have to pass
Fresh cup of coffee, no, no
I'd rather have you in my glass
Only thing's that's gonna sweeten my tongue
Only thing that's gonna last now
Is another bite of you, babe
Breakfast can wait (You don't even have to ask)

Finally, my eyes are open (Oh yeah)
I dream about you all night long (Night long)
The only thing that I've been hopin' for
Is 'fore you to go to work, babe, we get it on
I ain't tryin' to make you blush, but I just wanted to tell ya (Tell you)
I think you're great (Oh yeah)
I know you're late, but I need another taste
Breakfast can wait
Breakfast can wait

Can't stop even if the police come
Breakfast can wait
I got a double time, kick drum
Breakfast, breakfast
You can't leave a black man in this state
Breakfast can wait
Oh no
Breakfast, breakfast can wait
Come here, baby, let me put you on my plate
Hey now
Breakfast can wait
Better call your job, yeah
Breakfast can wait
Tell 'em you gon' be late
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Breakfast can wait

You're the only thing I need
Breakfast can wait
Sweetness in my tongue
Come here, baby
Breakfast can wait

You might need to come again
Breakfast, breakfast can wait
