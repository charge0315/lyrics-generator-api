I've got a thing to do
And I know it's gonna hurt you
I'm sure it will cost me too
But I'm willing to pay my dues
Red blood in vessels out through
It's hard to believe but true
I've got a thing to do
I hope it will get me through
Come on now, let's leave this party
We don't care what they do or say
I'll never get the keys to the city
I'm only staying for one day
Hold your ground
Don't ever look down
Stare them straight in the eye
I'll never get the keys to the city
I don't care I'm only passing by
I've got a thing to do
I'm afraid I miss my cue
You only got a second
Or to tell me now
What would you do
Red blood in vessels out through
I don't wanna make you blew
It's something I have to do
Come on now, let's leave this party
We don't care what they do or say
I'll never get the keys to the city
I'm only staying for one day
Hold your ground
Don't ever look down
Stare them straight in the eye
I'll never get the keys to the city
I don't care I'm only passing by
Tommorow I'll be far away
I'm only staying for one day
Tommorow I'll be far away
I'm only staying for one day
I'll never get the keys to the city
I'll never get the keys to the city
I've got a thing to do
And I know it's gonna hurt you
I'm sure it will cost me too
But I'm willing to pay my dues
Red blood in vessels out through
It's hard to believe but true
I've got a thing to do
