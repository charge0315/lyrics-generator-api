Love for sale
Appetizing young love for sale
Love that's fresh and still unspoiled
Love that's only slightly soiled
I've got love for sale
Who will buy?
Who would like to sample my supply?
Who's prepared to pay the price
For a trip to paradise?
I've got love for sale
Let the poets pipe of love in their childish way
'Cos I know every type of love better far than they
If you want the thrill of love, I've been through the mill of love
Old love, new love, every love but true love

If you want to buy my wares
Follow me and climb the stairs
