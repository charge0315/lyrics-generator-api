Dearest constellation
Heaven surroundin' you
Stay there, soft and blue
Virginia moon, I'll wait for you tonight

Sweetest invitation
Breakin' the day in two
Feelin' like I do
Virginia moon, I'll wait for you tonight

And now our shades become shadows in your light
In the morning when we're through
And tomorrow rescues you, I will say
Goodnight

Secret fascination
Whisper a quiet tune
Hear me callin' you
Virginia moon, I'll wait for you tonight

And now our shades become shadows in your light
In the morning when we're through
And tomorrow rescues you, I will say
Goodnight

Virginia moon, I'll wait for you tonight

And now our shades become shadows in your light
In the morning when we're through
And tomorrow rescues you, I will say
Goodnight

I will say goodnight
I will say goodnight
