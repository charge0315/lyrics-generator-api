Doodle wop a-rat-a-tat boom
I'll make the sound of a jet plane zoom
Doodle wop a-rat-a-tat boom
I'll make the sound of a fire

You got to believe in somethin'
Why not believe in me?
You got to believe in somethin'
Why not believe in me?

Tell Me, Brotha:
What have I, I done to you
To make you mean
And treat me the way you do?
Go on and wave your flag, Brotha!
Start your revolution!
I'm willin' to let you do your thing
Tell me, why are you blind
When it comes to mine?

Take the chain off your brain
Take the chain off your brain
Listen, Brotha:
You always talkin' bout
"The world needs changin'!"
You better stop!
Take a look at yourself!
Stop ridiculin' everybody else!
