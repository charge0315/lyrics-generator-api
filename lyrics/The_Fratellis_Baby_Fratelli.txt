Woo!

I said, "Oh my, oh no, not I
I was just busy watching everyone go by"
Outside the shite bar in your old red car
Me and your girlfriend and your sister with the big scar
I said, "Oh Christ", and I told you twice
It's just not easy going through all these things thrice
What's this I once heard, you drive a Bluebird
You got no money for the petrol, that's what I heard

And it's alright, she'll be sucking fingers all night
Wearing those shoes, oh, any excuse to go to the gang fight
And though she's alright, everybody says she's uptight
Sick in the head, but first in the bed
So easy to be Friday's nightmare
Woo!

I said, "Oh no, oh please just go
You got no eyelids and sweet Ella loves me so
She got my number, though I can't stand her
I can't help digging her, I hope, I guess, I wonder
And though it's clear you want me, dear
It would be easier if I was never here
You got the money, and I got the reason
I'll stick around with you for just another season"

And it's alright, she'll be sucking fingers all night
Wearing those shoes, oh, any excuse to go to the gang fight
And though she's alright, everybody says she's uptight
Sick in the head, but first in the bed
So easy to be Friday's nightmare

And she's just gettin' along
So don't tell me she's yours, oh please tell me I'm wrong again
It's all in a day
So what can you say?
Just sleep in your shoes
With the window box blues and it's time you choose, oh yeah

She said, "Oh my, oh no, not I
I was just busy watching everyone go by"
What's this I once heard, you drive a Bluebird
You got no money for the petrol, that's what I heard

And it's alright, she'll be sucking fingers all night
Wearing those shoes, oh, any excuse to go to the gang fight
And oh she's alright, everybody says she's uptight
Sick in the head, but first in the bed
So easy to be Friday's wonder
