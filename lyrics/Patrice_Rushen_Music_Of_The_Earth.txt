There's no need to rush
'Cause there is no hurry
Hear the music of the earth
Fa-fa-ra-fa-fa
Life will make the space
You don't have to worry
Hear the music of the earth
Fa-fa-ra-fa-fa
Be the new rebirth
Music of the earth
Breeze is blowing through the trees
Can move you, groove you, soothe you
There's no need to rush
'Cause there is no hurry
Hear the music of the earth
Fa-fa-ra-fa-fa
Life will make the space
You don't have to worry
Hear the music of the earth
Fa-fa-ra-fa-fa

Be the new rebirth
Music of the earth
Breeze is blowing through the trees
Can move you, groove you, soothe you
There's no need to rush
'Cause there is no hurry
Hear the music of the earth
Fa-fa-ra-fa-fa
Life will make the space
You don't have to worry
Hear the music of the earth
Fa-fa-ra-fa-fa
There's no need to rush
'Cause there is no hurry
Hear the music of the earth
