You
Are a song surrounding me
Sweet melody that I sing
Your hands caress me
And make me calm
A symphony wrapped in your arms

Ooh-ooh-ooh
You know the places
That lead to the warm senses, embraces
You have shown my feelings more
Than they've ever hoped to see
You're musical massage to me

Your hands caress me
And make me calm
Symphonies wrapped in your arms

Ooh-ooh-ooh
You, you know the places
That lead to the warm senses, embraces
Oh, you have shown my feelings more
Than they've ever hoped to see
You're musical massage to me
