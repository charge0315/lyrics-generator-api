One, two, three

Baby, love never felt so good
And I'd doubt if it ever could
Not like you hold me, hold me
Oh, baby, love never felt so fine
And I’d doubt if it's never mine
Not like you hold me, hold me

And the night is gonna be just fine
Gotta fly, gotta see
I can't wait, I can't take it

'Cause baby, every time I love you
In and out my life, in, out, baby
Tell me, if you really love me
It's in and out my life, in, out, baby
So baby, yes, love never felt so good

Oh, baby, love never felt so fine
And I’d doubt if it's ever mine
Not like you hold me, hold me
Oh, baby, love never felt so good
And I’d doubt if it ever could
Not like you hold me, hold me
In the night through the thick and thin
Gotta fly, gotta see, can't believe
I can't take it

'Cause baby, every time I love you
It’s in and out my life, in, out, baby
Tell me, if you really love me
It's in and out my life, driving me crazy
Baby, love never felt so good (Oh, good, uh-huh, uh-huh, mmm)

Oh, baby, love never felt so fine
And I’d doubt if it was mine, all mine
Not like you hold me, hold me
Oh, baby, love never felt so good, so good
And I’d doubt if it ever could
Not like you hold me, hold me

And the nights, that feels good
Gotta fly, gotta see
Can't believe
I can't take it

'Cause baby, every time I love you
It's in and out my life, in, out, baby
Tell me if you really love me
It's in and out my life, driving me crazy
'Cause baby, love never felt so good

Got what you got, so good
Oh it never felt so good
Never felt so good
Don't you know, it never felt so good
Never felt so good (Yeah, yeah)
It never felt so good
Never felt so good (Yeah)
Alright, that's fine
That's it
