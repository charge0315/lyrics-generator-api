On and on the story goes
It appears to have no end
No-o beginning
And though the battle's fairly far
It would seem there's little chance
Of ever winning
I've been left out in the rain
If it were up to me the sun would shine again
It looks grim from where I stand
The ruins of another fight
Reach out across the wood
Forces in a dark sky
They sing a song that sounds all wrong
Such a reason has no rhyme
I got to do it my way
I've been left out in the rain
If it were up to me the sun would shine again
It makes no difference where I stand
Horse and rider move as one
To glide before the blast
Take care not to stumble
Straining for that destiny
Some half remembered dream
Knowing it must crumble
Knowing it must crumble
