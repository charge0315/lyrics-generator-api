Many getting aren't grateful
Bound by stuff, not sound
I'm so lucky my faith is you
'Cause you stay around past sundown
Apathy looms like a blue sky
Shortcoming stolen wants and why?
I'm so lucky my joy is you
'Cause we stay heaven high
Like there ain't enough fake
So much got my binds in a rut
Find the blind, guide the blind
And nobody's got the time for love
Nor ideas so lucky my vision's clear, it's you
Whatever else is to do
So lucky my love is you
So lucky my love is you
So lucky my love is you
So lucky my love is you
So lucky my love is you
So lucky, baby
Now Jack won't jump back
And Jill won't keep still
So lucky my praise is you
King of all thrones knows how I feel
And though some wheels keep shinin'
We steady dyin' grindin'
So lucky you're my diamond
In you no shame or lyin'
In you no fear of flyin'
In you always confidin'
In you the reason why
And I'm so lucky I'm on your side
Apathy looms like a blue sky
Comin' up too short to cry
So lucky my love is you
'Cause we stay heaven high
So lucky my love is you
So lucky my love is you
So lucky my love is you
So lucky my love is you
Shut it down
Stop the ill go round
Call your children now
So lucky we bow
Shut it down
Stop perversions prowl
Call your children now
So lucky we bow
