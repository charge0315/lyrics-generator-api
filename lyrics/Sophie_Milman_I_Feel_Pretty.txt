I feel pretty
Oh, so pretty
I feel pretty and witty and bright
And I pity
Any one who isn't me tonight

I feel charming
Oh, so charming
It's alarming how charming I feel
And so pretty
I hardly can believe I'm real

See that pretty girl in that mirror there?
Who can that attractive girl be?
Such a pretty face, such a pretty dress
Such a pretty smile, such a pretty me

I feel stunning
Oh, so stunning
Feel like running and jumping for joy
'Cause I'm loved
By a pretty wonderful boy

I feel pretty
Oh, so pretty
I feel pretty and witty and bright
And I pity
Any one who isn't me tonight

I feel charming
Woah, woah, woah, so charming
It's alarming how charming I feel
And so pretty
I hardly can believe I'm real

See that pretty girl in that mirror there?
Who can that attractive girl be?
Such a pretty face, a pretty dress
A pretty smile, such a pretty me

I feel stunning
Oh, oh, so stunning
Feel like running and jumping for joy
'Cause I'm loved
By a pretty wonderful boy

See that pretty girl in that mirror there?
Who can that attractive girl be?
Such a pretty dress, a pretty face
A pretty smile, such a pretty me

I feel stunning
Oh, so stunning
Feel like running and jumping for joy
'Cause I'm loved
By a pretty wonderful boy
Yes, I'm loved
By a pretty wonderful boy
