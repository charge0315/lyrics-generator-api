Hey, you keep giving up
Saying there's no way to survive each day
Hey, you got to fight
Just to keep the faith, that's the only way
Come walk with me
Let your dreams find a new expression
Wake up your mind to a new direction
If you believe, just believe in magic
Then anything, anything can happen
Open your heart to the magic waiting there
Hey, you can take control
Of your destiny, you hold the only key
Hey, you can touch the sky
Got to reach for more, that's what dreams are for
Don't be afraid
Go where the spirit leads you
You have it made, it's all waiting for you
If you believe, just believe in magic
Then anything, anything can happen
Trust in your dreams and you'll see your dreams come true
Follow your heart and it won't mislead you
Look to the stars, follow where they lead you
Open your heart to the magic waiting there

Do you believe, do you believe in magic?
You better believe, believe it and you can have it
You better believe
See your dreams come true
If you believe and I believe, everything in magic
Then anything, anything can happen
And watch up in the stars
We can work the magic
If you believe, you believe in magic
Then anything, anything can happen
Trust in your dreams and you'll see your dreams come true
