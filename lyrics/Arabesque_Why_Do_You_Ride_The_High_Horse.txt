You and I fell in love
It was clear to me
All my life there would only be
Only be you
Me and you
Every kiss you gave me was true
You were holding me close night and day
But now you are so far away
Why do you ride that high horse
Come on down to where you belong
Why do you ride that high horse
One day it will go wrong
Why do you ride that high horse
Come on down to where you belong
Why do you ride that high horse
My love for you is strong
But don't let me wait too long
Try to be the man
Who once fell in love with me
Say again as you used to do:
"Baby, I need you"
But it seems
You were holding me close night and day
But now you are far away
Why do you ride that high horse
Come on down to where you belong
Why do you ride that high horse
One day it will go wrong
Why do you ride that high horse
Come on down to where you belong
Why do you ride that high horse
My love for you is strong
But don't let me wait too long
Why do you ride that high horse
Come on down to where you belong
Why do you ride that high horse
One day it will go wrong
Why do you ride that high horse
Come on down to where you belong
Why do you ride that high horse
My love for you is strong
Why do you ride that high horse
Come on down to where you belong
Why do you ride that high horse
One day it will go wrong
Why do you ride that high horse
Come on down to where you belong
Why do you ride that high horse
My love for you is strong
