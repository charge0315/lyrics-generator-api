I was born in Texas 'neath a sky of blue
That's where my ancestors lived and died
Maine or California may look good to you
But Texas always keeps me satisfied
Haven't got a worry, haven't got a care
Haven't got a thing to call my own
Tho' I'm out of money I'm a millionaire
I still have my home in San Antone
When I greet my neighbor with a howdy all
I'm wealthy as a king upon a throne
You can have your mansion or a cottage small
I'll just take my home in San Antone
Traveled o'er the country on my merry way
Been in crowds and felt I was alone
When I feel like bragging I just up and say
I'm a native son of San Antone
There's a sweet somebody by the Alamo
Someday she's gonna be my very own
Then we'll get a highchair in a year or so
For our little home in San Antone
