Girl when you do what you do to me
Everything is the way it should be
You make me feel like I'm living a dream
Tell me it's real
Cause I'm telling you
You take my breath away
I swear to you
You take my breath away
Girl I've been waiting for you all my life
I see my soul when I look in your eyes
You've taken me completely by surprise
Tell me it's real
Cause I'm telling you
You take my breath away
I swear to you
You take my breath away (Yes you do)
I'm speaking truths
You take my breath away
I swear to you
You take my breath away (Yes you do)
You don't have to promise me forever
All I'm asking you for is tonight
You need to take some time and see where this is going
Girl it feels so right when we hold each other tight
Woo Hoo
Oh Yeah
Tell me it's real
Cause I'm telling you
You take my breath away
I swear to you
You take my breath away
Honest you do
You take my breath away
I'm speaking truths
You take my breath away
I ain't lyin gto you
You take my breath away
I'm speaking truths
You take my breath away
I swear to you
You take my breath away
Honestly you do
