Everybody gets the chance to find
Some things seems so late when mere on time
Good things with the bad are surely due
While happiness and sadness will pursue
What could be some people might despise
Could be your blessing in disguise?
Could be your blessing in disguise
Blessing in disguise, blessing in disguise
Everybody gets the chance to see
That everybody gets the chancе to be
Many things that cannot be so small
Why just make it happеn after all?
What could be some people might despise
Could be your blessing in disguise?
Could be your blessing in disguise
Blessing in disguise, blessing in disguise
Oh blessing, oh yeah yeah
Blessing in disguise (x4)
Right in front of me in all of the time
That's what I need all the time
Many things that cannot be so small
Oh we'd be all so happy after all
And that understanding this and realize
Could be your blessing in disguise
Blessing in disguise
Could be your blessing in disguise
Blessing in disguise
Oh blessing, oh yeah yeah
