O my friends you've been untrue to me
As my heart went astray
When my love chose to lurk in the sea
To live her own way
And all of you have run off the dance
That sadness kept for me
O my friends you've been untrue to me
You stole my heart away
Hey my heart, let me be
Hang on back to the trees
My sad memory
Please my heart, let me be
Free in my so late dreams
Early in the morning
Free in my so late dreams
Early in the morning
