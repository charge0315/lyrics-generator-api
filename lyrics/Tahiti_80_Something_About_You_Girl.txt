Don't let me make a fool of myself, I only
I only want you to see the best in me
I know we're in this together
But I don't wanna be your broken mirror
Something about you, girl
I know our love will last forever
I'll put my pride on a shelf, I'll leave
Some space for you and your mystery
Although I may not understand
Everything you do
You know I really just don't mind
Something about you, girl
I know our love will last forever
We're doing this together
It's only getting better
Something about you, girl
I know our love will last forever
