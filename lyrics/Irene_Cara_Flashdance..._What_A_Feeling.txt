First, when there's nothing, but a slow glowing dream
That your fear seems to hide deep inside your mind
All alone, I have cried silent tears full of pride
In a world made of steel, made of stone

Well, I hear the music, close my eyes, feel the rhythm
Wrap around, take a hold of my heart

What a feelin', being's believin'
I can have it all, now I'm dancing for my life
Take your passion and make it happen
Pictures come alive, you can dance right through your life

Now I hear the music, close my eyes, I am rhythm
In a flash, it takes hold of my heart

What a feelin', being's believin'
I can have it all, now I'm dancing for my life
Take your passion, and make it happen
Pictures come alive, now I'm dancing through my life

What a feelin'

What a feeling (I am music now), being's believin' (I am rhythm now)
Pictures come alive, you can dance right through your life
What a feeling (I can really have it all)
What a feeling (Pictures come alive when I call)
I can have it all (I can really have it all)
Have it all (Pictures come alive when I call)
(Call, call, call, call, oh, what a feeling) I can have it all
(Being's believin')
Take your passion (Being's believin', oh)
(Make it happen) Make it happen
(What a feeling) What a feeling
(Being's believin')...
