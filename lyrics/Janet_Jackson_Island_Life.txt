Come into this sacred and erotic dream
It's a world I know you wanna share
Baby, let's indulge in things that set our bodies free
Promise me that you will meet me there

What better way than to wind down
On streets paved in harmony
I like the sexy sounds from the DJ
Damn, I think he's spinnin' this one for me

Island in the sun, just you and I will go
Ride into the wave like echo
When I hear that song, I wanna be with you
Headed for the nightlife echo

Close my eyes and there you are in front of me
Takin' me to where I wanna go
Baby, from my little shop of curiosities
Boy, I'll show you all you need to know; come on, baby

What better way than to wind down
On streets paved in harmony
I like the sexy sounds from the DJ
Damn, I think he's spinning this one for me

Island in the sun, just you and I will go
Ride into the wave like echo
When I hear that song, I wanna be with you
Headed for the nightlife echo

What better way than to wind down
On streets paved in harmony
I like the sexy sounds from the DJ
Damn, I think he's spinning this one for me

Island in the sun, just you and I will go
Ride into the wave like echo
When I hear that song, I wanna be with you
Headed for the nightlife echo
Island in the sun, just you and I will go
Ride into the wave like echo
When I hear that song, I wanna be with you
Headed for the nightlife echo

Island life, sunshine and paradise
All night, I wanna give it to you
Island life, sunshine and paradise
Every night, I'm gonna give it to you (Give me the high life)
Island life, sunshine and paradise
All night I wanna give it to you (Give me the good life)
Island life, sunshine and paradise
Every night I'm gonna give it to you
Give me the high life
Give me the good life
Give me the good life
Give me the good life
