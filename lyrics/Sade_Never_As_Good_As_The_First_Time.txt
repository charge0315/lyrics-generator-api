Never as good
No, baby

Good times they come and they go, never going to know
What fate is going to blow
Your way just hope that it feels right
Sometimes it comes and it goes, you take it ever so slow
And then you lose it, then it flows right to you
So we rely on the past and special moments that last
Were they as tender as we dare to remember
Such a fine time as this what could equal the bliss
The thrill of the first kiss, It'll blow right to you

It's never as good as the first time
It's never as good as the first time
(Never as good as the first time)

Good times they come and they go, never going to know
It's like the weather, one day chicken, next day feathers
The rose we remember, the thorns we forget
We'd love and leave, we never spend a minute on regret
It is a possibility, the more we know the less we see
Second time, is not quite what it seems
Natural as the way we came to be
The second time, won't live up to the dream

It's never as good as the first time (Never as good)
It's never as good as the first time
(Never as good as the first time)

Ba-da-da-ba-ba-ba
Ba-da-da-da-ba-ba
Ba-da-da-ba-ba-ba
Ba-da-da-da-ba-ba
Natural as the way we came to be
Second time won't live up to the dream
It's natural as the way we came to be
The second time is not quite what it seems

It's never, ooh, as good as the first time
As the first time
Never as good as the first time

Natural as the way we came to be
Second time won't live up to the dream
Natural as the way we came to be
Second time is not quite what it seems

It's never as good as the first time
As the first time
As good as the first time
Ba-da-da-ba-ba-ba
Ba-da-da-da-ba-ba
