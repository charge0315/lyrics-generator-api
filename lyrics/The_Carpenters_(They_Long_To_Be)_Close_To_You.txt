Why do birds suddenly appear
Every time you are near?
Just like me, they long to be
Close to you

Why do stars fall down from the sky
Every time you walk by?
Just like me, they long to be
Close to you

On the day that you were born, the angels got together
And decided to create a dream come true
So they sprinkled moon dust in your hair
Of gold and starlight in your eyes of blue

That is why all the girls in town (Girls in town)
Follow you all around (Follow you all around)
Just like me, they long to be
Close to you

On the day that you were born, the angels got together
And decided to create a dream come true
So they sprinkled moon dust in your hair
Of gold and starlight in your eyes of blue

That is why all the girls in town (Girls in town)
Follow you all around (Follow you all around)
Just like me, they long to be
Close to you
Just like me, they long to be (Just like me)
Close to you

Wa-ah-ah, close to you
Wa-ah-ah, close to you
Ha-ah-ah, close to you
Wa-ah-ah, close to you
Wa-ah-ah, close to you
Wa-ah-ah, close to you
Wa-ah-ah, close to you
