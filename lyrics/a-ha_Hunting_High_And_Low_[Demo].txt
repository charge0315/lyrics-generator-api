Watching days
Follow days
In these times
I've seen your face
Window shopping
For a sweetheart
And new shoes
Changing looks
In your eyes
Came to me
As no surprise
Now something's dark
Against the light
Hunting high and low
High
There's no end to lengths I'd go to
High and low
High
There's no end to the lengths I'd go to
Lovely day
One of those
Lovely days
I've seen your face
Eye to eye
For the last time
Too
There's something wanting in me
Something dark against the light
I tear myself to pieces
Trying to follow everything at once
I'm hunting high and low
High
There's no end to lengths I'd go to
Was it all my fault?
Well you know what it means to love you
I'm hunting high and low
High
There's no end to lengths I'd go to
Was it all my fault?
Well you know what it means to love you
Ahhhhh
