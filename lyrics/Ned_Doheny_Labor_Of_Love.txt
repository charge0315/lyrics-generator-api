If it must be done
Let it be a labor of love
If it must come down
Let it fall from heaven above
Not much difference in the 'twixt and the 'twain
When you're lost in your mind
Always reachin' for an outstretched refrain
Play it one more time
If it must be done
Let it be a labor of love
If it must come down
Let it fall from heaven above
Always troubled by the trace that remains
In your blood goin' by
Never make it if you can't take thе strain
Give it one more try
Lеt it be a labor of love
Let it be a labor of love
Not much difference in the 'twixt and the 'twain
When you're lost in your mind
Always reachin' for an outstretched refrain
Play it one more time
If it must be done
Let it be a labor of love
If it must be done
Let it be a labor of love
If it must be done
Let it be a labor of love
If it's got to fall
Let it fall from heaven above
If it must be done
Let it be a labor of love
If it must be done
Let it be a labor of love
Hey, hey, hey
Let it be a labor of love
