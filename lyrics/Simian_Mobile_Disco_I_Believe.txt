I believe you could be
What I need to believe
I believe you could be
What I need to believe
I believe you could be
What I need to believe
I believe you could be
What I need to believe

It's the same old song that I always sing each year
But because it's perennial don't make it less real

And I believe that she could be
What I need to believe

I believe you could be (I believe)
What I need to believe
I believe you could be
What I need to believe (Oh, it just keeps comin' 'round again)
I believe you could be
What I need to believe (It just keeps comin' 'round again)
I believe you could be
What I need to believe (It just keeps comin' 'round again)

The conclusion I need is easily reached with you
You have given me all and there's nothing left to do

And I believe that she could be
What I need to believe
I believe
It just keeps comin' 'round again

I believe you could be
What I need to believe (It just keeps comin' 'round again)
I believe you could be
What I need to believe (It just keeps comin' 'round again)
I believe you could be
What I need to believe (It just keeps comin' 'round again)
I believe you could be
What I need to believe
