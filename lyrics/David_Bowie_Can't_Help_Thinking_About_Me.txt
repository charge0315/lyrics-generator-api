Question time that says I brought dishonour
My head's bowed in shame
Seems that I've blackened the family name
My mother says that she can't stand the neighbours talking
I've gotta pack my bags, leave this home, start walking
I'm guilty, I wish that I was sorry this time
I wish that I could pay for my crime

Can't help thinking about me
Can't help thinking about me
Can't help thinking about me

Remember when we used to go to church on Sundays?
I lay awake at night, terrified of school on Mondays
It's too late now
I wish I was a child again
I wish I felt secure again

Can't help thinking about me
Can't help thinking about me
Can't help thinking about me

As I pass a recreation ground
Remember my friends, always been found and I can't

Can't help thinking about me
Can't help thinking about me
Can't help thinking about me

Now I leave them all in the never never land
The station seems so cold, the ticket's in my hand
My girl calls my name, "Hi, Dave
Drop in, see around, come back
If you're this way again"
I'm on my own, I've got a long long way to go
Hope I make it on my own

Can't help thinking about me
Can't help thinking about me
Can't help thinking about me
Can't help thinking about me
I can't help thinking about me
I can't help thinking about me
I can't help thinking about me
Can't help thinking about me
I can't help thinking about me

Can't help thinking about me
Can't help thinking about me (I can't help thinking about me)
Can't help thinking about me (I can't help thinking about me)
Can't help thinking about me (I can't help thinking about me)
Can't help thinking about me (I can't help thinking about me)
Can't help
