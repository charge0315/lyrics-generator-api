I light your cigarettes
I bring you apples from the vine
How quickly you forget
I run the bath and pour the wine
I bring you everything that floats into your mind

But you don't bring me anything but down
No, you don't bring me anything but down
You don't bring me anything but down
When you come 'round

You are a raging sea
I pull myself out every day
I plea insanity
'Cause I can't leave and I can't stay
You say, "Won't you come find me?" and yes is what I say

But you don't bring me anything but down
No, you don't bring me anything but down
Everything is crashing to the ground

Well, maybe I'm not your perfect kind
Maybe I'm not what you had in mind
And maybe we're just killing time

You with your silky words
And your eyes of green and blue
You with your steel beliefs
That don't match anything you do
It was so much easier before you became you

Now you don't bring me anything but down
No, you don't bring me anything but down
Now everything just crashes to the ground
When you come around

When you come around

Well, no more playing seek and hide
No more long and wasted nights
Can't you make it easy on yourself?
Well, I know you wish you were strong
You wish you were never wrong
Well, I got some wishes of my own
