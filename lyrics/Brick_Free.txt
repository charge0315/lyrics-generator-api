Bitch, free my brother
Bitch, free my brother
Bitch, free my brother
Yeah, alright (Okay)

You bitch niggas know how we comin' (Know that)
When we bounced out on him, he knew it was over, I don't even know why he runnin' (Dumbass)
My new bitch gotta have an ass and a bag, my old bitch wasn't just nothin' (She ain't shit)
She all on my dick 'cause I got me a bag, she don't know I ain't buyin' her nothin' (You know that)
My niggas ain't fuckin' with rats, you trippin', we would've been killed Gunna (You know that)
All of my opps gettin' lucky, they keep on survivin' the summer
I don't think I'ma ever get old, I'ma keep gettin' younger and dumber (Yeah)
Hop out, make it sound like thunder, shit-bag him, put this bitch to his stomach (Yeah)
Bitch, is we fuckin' or not? Let me know now, I don't want your number
We done caught him in traffic and asked him, it's tragic, we done pushed all up in his bumper
We'll take everything from your socks to your shirt, don't come 'round with all that stuntin' (Bitch)
When it come to them B's, you niggas be tellin', if they ask, I ain't did nothin'
If you think it's a game tryna beef with the gang, better have a lot of guns and some money
Had one of my hoes to bond me out, I ain't had to touch none of my money
The last nigga cracked him a joke, he dead now, now ask, do he think shit funny?
If you beefin' with us, better hide your kids, nigga, 'cause, pussy, we comin' for sonny
When I come through spinnin', I don't care if it's an old nigga, I promise I'm gon' hit somethin'
Free Famous, he fightin' that body, they give him a bond, he know that we comin' (Free my brother)
Free MC, he hop out with a button (You know that)
Free Killa, he kill you for nothin' (You know that)
Free Licky, I'll call his phone like, "Slide," he shootin' up quick, no discussion (You know that)
All this rap shit don't mean nothin', I'll hit me a hat up in public
Bitch say she havin' her way, gon' be in the clink doin' all that fuckin'
Lil' Vonno'll slime you out, they say that I can't be trusted (What?)
12 just hit them lights, Lil' Don, go 'head and just dust 'em
I hate when the goofies die, they always tryna say they the muscle
When I'm in the back of that hot with a gun, I promise you niggas in trouble
(When I'm in the back of that hot with a gun, I promise you niggas in trouble)
(When I'm in the back of that hot with a gun, I promise you niggas in trouble, go)

Free my brother
Free the whole TG
