Everybody sees it
I know they can feel it
Our subtle disagreements
The gesture that you’re leaving
I know you’re on your way
I see how you watch those planes
In the dark
In the dark
We stare into the silence
We focus on the distance
I watch the sky fall in
Anything could happen
But when the lights go out
Are we just strangers
In the dark?
We’re in the dark
Kiss me
Hold me to your body
If you’ll miss me
Don’t say a word
‘cause I’ll fall apart
Fall apart
Touch me, fold me in your arms
If you love me
Only for a minute
I’ll fall apart
Fall apart
Effortless at high school
Now everything is different
We were just children
Playing at lovers
When did it get so hard?
Remember those promises we made
In the dark
In the dark
Kiss me
Hold me to your body
If you’ll miss me
Don’t say a word
‘cause I’ll fall apart
Fall apart
Touch me, fold me in your arms
If you love me
Only for a minute
I’ll fall apart
Fall apart
What joy!
What pain!
I lost my way
And it happened in the dark
It was too hard
Too far
Too cold to push through
And too long
Too dark to hold
It was different with the way
It's happening in the dark
Kiss me
Hold me to your body
If you’ll miss me
Don’t say a word
‘cause I’ll fall apart
Fall apart
