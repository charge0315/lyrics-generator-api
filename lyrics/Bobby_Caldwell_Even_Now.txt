Sometimes when I'm in a crowd
I'll start reminiscing
And find myself missing
The sound of your laughter
The ring of your voice
But know in my heart
That I do it by choice

Though I try to see reason
My mind always ends up on
You anyhow...Girl

Even now I can say
That I still dream of you
There are times that I wonder
If you miss me too
Maybe I'll outgrow it
If the time allows
Even though I know it
Lingers even now...Even now

I try keeping friends around
And they entertain me
But I keep complaining
That something is missing
I can't sleep at night
And I don't hear a word
When they give me advice

Maybe love is the reason
That I keep believing you'll
Come back somehow...Girl

Even now I can say
That I still dream of you
There are times that I wonder
If you miss me too
Maybe I'll outgrow it
If the time allows
Even though I know it
Lingers even now...Even now

Even now I go to places we would go
That's the one escape I know
Where I can keep on dreaming

Each time I try to see reason
My mind keeps on thinkin'
You'll come back somehow...Girl

Even now I can say
That I still dream of you
There are times that I wonder
If you miss me too
Maybe I'll outgrow it
If the time allows
Even though I know it
Lingers even now...Even now
