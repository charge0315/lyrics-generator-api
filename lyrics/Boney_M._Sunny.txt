Sunny
Yesterday my life was filled with rain
Sunny
You smiled at me and really eased the pain

The dark days are gone and the bright days are here
My sunny one shines so sincere

Sunny, one so true
I love you

Sunny (Yeah)
Thank you for the sunshine bouquet (That sweet bouquet)
Sunny
Thank you for the love you've brought my way

You gave to me your all and all
And now I feel ten feet tall

Sunny, one so true
I love you

Sunny
Thank you for the truth you let me see
Sunny
Thank you for the facts from A to Z

My life was torn like the wind-blown sand
And a rock was formed when you held my hand

Sunny, one so true
I love you
Sunny

(Yeah)

Sunny
Thank you for the smile upon your face
Sunny
Thank you for the gleam that shows disgrace

You're my part of nature's fire
You're my sweet complete desire

Sunny, one so true
I love you

Sunny (Sunny)
Yesterday my life was filled with rain
Sunny (Sunny, yeah)
You smiled at me and really eased the pain

The dark days are gone and the bright days are here
My sunny one shines so sincere

Sunny, one so true
I love you (Yeah)

I love you (Oh, my baby)
I love you
I love you
I love you
I love you
I love you
