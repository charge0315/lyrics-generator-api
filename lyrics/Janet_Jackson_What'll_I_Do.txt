What'll I do for satisfaction?
Honey, you take care of me now
If you leave, I can't make it
Darlin' please, don't you put me down

'Cause what'll I do for satisfaction?
If you take away your heart
'Cause what'll I do for satisfaction?
When that funny, funny feeling's gone
Oh, what'll I do?

I can't take no more of missin' you
I don't know just what I'm gonna do
How can I love another?
Oh, you don't know just what you mean to me

'Cause what'll I do for satisfaction?
If you take away, away your heart
What'll I do for satisfaction?
When my nights start to gettin' long

Oh, no, no
Boy, I love ya
Wanna hold ya
Love, hey, yeah
Woo

Your love's strong and that's no lie
And I hate, I hate to put it down
But if you, if you leave me now
You won't want, want me hangin' around

'Cause what'll I do for satisfaction?
If you take away, away your heart
What'll I do for satisfaction?
When that funny, funny feeling's gone

Oh, I need you now
Woo
What'll I do, baby?
What'll I do, baby?
What'll I do, baby?
What'll I do, baby?
What'll I do, babe?
I said a-nah-nah-nah
Hey, uh

Hey, hey, hey
That's what I say
Hey, hey, hey
That's what I say
Can you want me?
What'll I do, babe?
Can you love me?
What'll I do, baby?
I said a-nah-nah-nah
I said a-nah-nah-nah
I said a-nah-nah-nah
I said a-nah-nah-nah
What'll I do?
