I look at you and you look at me
(It was a good vibration)
I look away for I knew what people would say
(Bad was your reputation)
I lumed around and I felt your eyes on my back
(It was a good vibration)
I walked away and I heard you following me
(There only was temptation)
I forgot ihe fear I always had
I din't think of what my molher always said:
Keep the wolf from the door
The man the who gets you
Has to give you so much more
Besides a loverman
He has to be the one who can
Keep the wolf
Keep the wolf
Keep the wolf from the door
One kiss and I was losing my heart
(It was a good vibration)
He said: "why don't you go home as soon as you can?
(I'm bad for you reputation)"
I said: "I stay, 'couse I loved you right from the start"
(It was a good vibration)
When people heard I was gonna marry this man
(It made a real sensation)
But he proved to me his love was true
He said: "I know exactly what I have to do"
Keep the wolf from the door
The man the who gets you
Has to give you so much more
Besides a loverman
He has to be the one who can
Keep the wolf
Keep the wolf
Keep the wolf from the door
Keep the wolf
Keep the wolf
Keep the wolf from the door
Keep the wolf from the door
The man the who gets you
Has to give you so much more
Besides a loverman
He has to be the one who can
Keep the wolf
Keep the wolf
Keep the wolf from the door
Keep the wolf
Keep the wolf
Keep the wolf from the door
