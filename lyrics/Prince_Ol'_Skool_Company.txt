Ooh, this my song
Huh
Ooh, this my song
Alright, look here, y'all
Flop hats, hot pants, and gold medallions
Fake grills, huh, to the side
Look out

Every once in a while you need some old school company
Somebody that appreciates a sexy groove and an old school melody
When God, His son, and the love of family ruled in the community
The songs you sing lift you up to Heaven, a Heaven we can believe in

Everybody's talking 'bout hard times like it just started yesterday
People I know, they've been struggling, at least it seems that way
Fat cats on Wall Street, they got a bailout
Why somebody else got to wait?
700 billion, but my old neighborhood
Ain't nothin' changed but the date – listen

Every once in a while you need some old school company
Somebody that appreciates a sexy groove and an old school melody, dig
When God, His son, and the love of family ruled in the community
The songs you sing lift you up to Heaven, a Heaven we can believe in

Ain't nothing ever came from complaining 'cept a bitter heart, that's true
Follow along and you going to want to do
Something before the next chorus is through
The songs we sang, they used to mean something
Now every other one's just mean
Rather than reminisce, I'm telling you this
It's time for a brand new scene, oh

Every once in a while you need some old school company
Somebody that appreciates a sexy groove and an old school melody
(Old school melody)
When God, His son, and the love of family ruled in the community
(It ruled, y'all, yes it did)
The songs we used to sang lift you up to Heaven, a Heaven we can believe in

Everybody's sinking in the quicksand created by the keepers of time
Cast aside by using ancient tricks that are changing your state of mind
Got you catering the whims of the flesh before
Before you get your paper right
Call me old-fashioned, but back in the day wasn't no shorties in sight

'Cause every day need some, ooh
(Old school company) We need it
Sexy groove
(Old school melody)
While we were pleadin'
Ruled in the community
Lift you up, a Heaven we can believe in
(Believe me, baby)

First come job, then come marriage
Before shorty come out with the baby carriage
Call me old-fashioned, just clap your hands, just clap your hands
Radio used to be local, untouched by, untouched by the man
Songs we used to sang used to mean something
Now they just bland, like your drummer

(Old school company) Where's the real drummer?
(Old school melody) Where's the real drummer?
Michael B., Mint Condition, Morris Day
(Ruled in the community)
And Jellybean wishing, Sheila E
(Life you up) And Brother John
And sometimes me, until the dawn

If the White House is Black, we got to take the radio back
Power to the people
Power to the people

New world hippies say we don't care
Make the party strip to they underwear
Turn the lights off, so they don't stare
Somebody blindfold Billy, he's so square
Christina Milian playin' "Truth or Dare?"
Maxwell and CeeLo, they gonna end up there
Pick another number – nickel, dime, don't care
As long as she havin' fun, nobody scared

I got a pocket full of... (Old school company)
I got a pocket full of plenty good time
Whoa, Lord, (Old school melody)
And Nicole's on the line
No, baby, you can't get in... uh, Lord
(Ruled in the community)
And neither can your man
You see, we got this cold, but this abusive thing goin' on
I'm just a bad mamajama, and y'all can't understand
Oh! Hit it

The new Minneapolis sound
Honey Collective, drop the needle down
(Old school company)
(The old school melody)

Well, how do you do?
See, there ain't another like me up in this chocolate box
You gotta dance for me, baby, if you wanna see me rock
Call the government man, tell him we got to be free
Valentina, tonight? Huh, I'm busy
So tell your mama, 77 Beverly Park gets better with time
We got the old school company, y'all, dancin' in the dark
I don't mind, I say, I don't mind
Put this thang on repeat
Go back to one and just, uh, move your feet, and
Tell your friends
Prince and the Minneapolis sound – we can't be beat, suckas!
Old school company
The old school melody
Ruled in the community
Lift you up, a Heaven we can believe in
