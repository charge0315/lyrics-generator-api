Notes are floating all up in my head
Never seem to stop, they never end
Keep burning away from your
Soul and you will have no place to burn
Memories are tearing me apart
Cost the all the effort from the start
I wish I could forget these things
Sorrow dark as life in Charlotte Greens
Gonna keep on, gonna do right
Gonna keep on, gonna do right
Happiness through music is the key
Don't you wanna come an follow me
I'm gon' take you off on a
Journey to a place of harmony
Simply we instigate the tone
Tell me how we sound just like a clone
Intertwining past and we'll
Merge in a creative symphony
Gonna keep on, gonna do right
Gonna keep on, gonna do right
(Yeah)
You can't be yourself with me
(Oh)
I can't be myself with you
(Yeah)
You can't be yourself with me
(Oh)
I can't be myself with you
Gonna keep on, gonna do right
Gonna keep on, gonna do right
(Yeah)
Ooh, I can't take this anymore
My legs give off into the floor
(Yeah)
I give you everything you need
Oh, music, let me be free
(Yeah)
Ooh, I can't take this anymore
My legs give off into the floor
(Yeah)
I give you everything you need
Oh, music, let me be free
