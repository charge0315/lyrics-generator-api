Get yourself together, let the light pour in
Pour yourself a hot bath, pour yourself a drink
Nothing's gonna happen without warning

Down is the new up
What is up, buttercup?
Down is the new up
Is the new up

(Won't you be my girl?)
(Won't you be my girl?)
Your services
(Won't you be my girl?)
Are not required
(Won't you be my girl?)
Your future's bleak
(Won't you be my girl?)
You're so last week
(Won't you be my girl?)

Ladies and gentlemen, without a safety net
I shall now perform a 180 flip-flop
I shall now amputate, I shall now contort

Because down is the new up
What if I just flip-flop?
Down is the new up
Down is the new up
Down is the new up
Is the new up

(You crawled off and left us)
(You crawled off and left us)
You're on candid camera
(You crawled off and left us)
The chink in your armour
(You crawled off and left us)
Topsy turvy town
(You bastard)
Topsy turvy town
(You bastard)
Shake your pockets out
(You crawled off and left us)
Pass it on, pass it down
(You crawled off and left us)
Topsy turvy town
(You bastard)
Topsy turvy town
(You bastard)
