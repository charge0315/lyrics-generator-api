Well I've cried all my tears
I've had enough time playing fool
It's the way that you walk through my life
Makes me wonder if I'm wasting my time
Got a picture of you by my bedside
Tells a story of times that we've shared
There's a smile on your face
That I never see much
And this is what I wanted to say
What do you mean when you say
That you love me, love me
That you love me, love me
Now I walk away broken hearted
Been a while since I felt that I needed you
Did you ever feel that you needed me?
(Needed me)
As I remember all the times that you were close to me
Seems the way ahead leaves me lonely
Like a flower that springs out of season
I can't take this no more
Won't you tell me your thoughts
'Cause this is what I wanted to say
What do you mean when you say
That you love me, love me
That you love me, love me
Why? Why does my heart stop beating
When you're away from me
(When you're away)
And why? Why am I weak from dreaming
I'm lost without you here
(Am I dreaming?)
(I feel so lonely inside)
(Is this a dream?)
(No more tears)
(I need to feel love, inside)
Tell me, am I dreaming?
(Do you love me? As much as I love you?)
What do you mean when you say
That you love me, love me
(Do you love me as much as I love you)
That you love me
(Am I dreaming or is there a view?)
That you love me
(Is me heart still beating, can it be with you too?)
That you love me
(Tell me that you love me, the way I love you)
That you love me
(Tell me that you love me, I need you)
