The seasons are all lost on me
In my subterranean lair
There's no reason for me to be
Coming up for air
(Ooh) Ooh, you're the one and only
Who can tempt me to be out there
(Ooh) They tell you things about me
And I love that you don't care
(Ooh) Oh no

I'm a sucker for these late nights
Burning candles at both ends
I'm the deer in your headlights
When you're racing through the bends
Gettin' down in Crown Heights
Where the party still ascends
I'm the deer in your headlights
When you're racing through the bends (Ah yeah)

When the darkness finally comes
I hear you calling me
Through the sounds of distant drums
It echoes back to me
I hate the taste of jealousy
Won't let my soul consume
Time with you is temporary, baby
So let the dance resume (Get it on now)

I'm a sucker for these late nights
Burning candles at both ends (Both ends)
I'm the deer in your headlights
When you're racing through the bends (Racing through the bends)
Gettin' down in Crown Heights (Whoa)
Where the party still ascends
I'm the deer in your headlights
When you're racing through the bends
I'm a sucker for these late nights
Burning candles at both ends (Both ends)
I'm the deer in your headlights
When you're racing through the bends (Through the bends)
Gettin' down in Crown Heights (Oh yes)
Where the party still ascends (Party still ascends)
I'm the deer in your headlights
When you're racing through the bends (Racing through the bends)

I'm a sucker for these late nights
Burning candles at both ends
I'm the deer in your headlights
When you're racing through the bends
Gettin' down in Crown Heights (Gettin' on down)
Where the party still ascends (Oh oh)
I'm the deer in your headlights (Oh)
When you're racing through the bends
I'm a sucker for these late nights
Burning candles at both ends (Racing at both ends)
I'm the deer in your headlights (Ah yeah)
When you're racing through the bends (Racing through the bends)
Gettin' down in Crown Heights (Gettin' down)
Where the party still ascends (Oh yeah)
I'm the deer in your headlights
When you're racing through the bends (Ooh)
I'm a sucker for these late nights
Burning candles at both ends
I'm the deer in your headlights
When you're racing through the bends (Ooh)
Gettin' down in Crown Heights
Where the party still ascends
I'm the deer in your headlights
When you're racing through the bends (Ooh)
I'm a sucker for these late nights
Burning candles at both ends
I'm the deer in your headlights
When you're racing through the bends (Ooh)
Gettin' down in Crown Heights
Where the party still ascends
I'm the deer in your headlights
When you're racing through the bends (Ooh)
