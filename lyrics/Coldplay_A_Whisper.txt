A whisper, a whisper, a whisper, a whisper
A whisper, a whisper, a whisper, a whisper

And I hear the sound of the tickin' of clocks
Remember your face, who remembers you when you are gone?
I hear the sound of the tickin' of clocks
Come back and look for me, look for me when I am lost

Just a whisper, a whisper, a whisper, a whisper
Just a whisper, a whisper, a whisper, a whisper

Night turns to day, and I still have these questions
Bridges will break, should I go forwards or backwards?
And night turns to day, and I still get no answers

Just a whisper, a whisper, a whisper, a whisper
Just a whisper, a whisper, a whisper, a whisper

I hear the sound of the tickin' of clocks
Remember your face, who remembers you when you are gone?
I hear the sound of the tickin' of clocks
Come back and look for me, look for me when I am lost

Just a whisper, a whisper, a whisper, a whisper
Just a whisper, a whisper, a whisper, a whisper

Ha-ah-ah, ha-ah-ah
Ha-ah-ah, ha-ah-ah
Ha-ah-ah, ha-ah-ah
Ha-ah-ah, ha-ah-ah
Ha-ah-ah, ha-ah-ah
Ha-ah-ah, ha-ah-ah
Ha-ah-ah, ha-ah-ah
