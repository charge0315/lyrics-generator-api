When she got seven pence
For a song and a dance
She was very happy
She was running and running
To give what she got to her mother (mother)
Then her mother would say:
"You'll be famous one day
Everyone will love you
There's no star above you in the sky"
Fly high, fly high
Fly away little butterfly
Fly high, fly high
Make your way little butterfly
Fly, fly high butterfly
She was famous one day
And the people would pay
Any price to see her
She was singing and dancing
Like nobody else but her mother (mother)
But her mother who'd seen
What she did on the screen
Said "It's getting better
Just a little better every time"
Fly high, fly high
Fly away little butterfly
Fly high, fly high
Make your way little butterfly
Fly, fly high butterfly
Fly high, fly high
Fly away little butterfly
Fly high, fly high
Make your way little butterfly
Fly, fly high butterfly
Fly, fly high butterfly
Fly, fly high butterfly
Fly, fly high butterfly
Fly, fly high butterfly
