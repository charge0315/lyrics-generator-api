I can feel your body
When I'm lying in bed
Too much confusion
Going around through my head

And it’s making me so angry
To know that the flame still burns
Why can't I get over?
And when will I ever learn?

Old love, leave me alone
Old love, just go on home

I can see your face
But I know that it's not real
Just an illusion
Caused by how I used to feel

And it’s making me so angry
To know that the flame will always burn
I'll never get over
I know now that I'll never learn

Old love, leave me alone
Old love, just go on home
