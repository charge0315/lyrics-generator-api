What's the matter with your life?
Is the poverty bringin' you down?
Is the mailman jerkin' you 'round?
Did he put your million dollar check in someone else's box?

Tell me, what's the matter with your world?
Was it a boy when you wanted a girl?
(Boy when you wanted a girl?)
Don't you know straight hair ain't got no curl?
(No curl)
Life it ain't real funky
Unless it's got that pop
Dig it

Pop life
Everybody needs a thrill
Pop life
We all got a space to fill
Pop life
Everybody can't be on top
But life, it ain't real funky
Unless it's got that
Dig it, dig it

Tell me, what's that underneath your hair?
Is there anybody livin' there?
(Anybody livin' there?)
You can't get over if you say you just don't care
(Don't care)
Show me a boy who stays in school and I'll show you a boy aware!
Dig it

Pop life
Everybody needs a thrill
Pop life
We all got a space to fill
Pop life
Everybody can't be on top
Life it ain't real funky
Unless it's got that pop
Dig it

What you putting in your nose?
Is that where all your money goes?
(Is that where your money goes?)
The river of addiction flows
You think it's hot, but there won't be no water
When the fire blows
Dig it

Pop life
Everybody needs a thrill
Pop life
We all got a space to fill
Pop life
Everybody can't be on top
But life it ain't real funky
Unless it's got that pop
Dig it

La la la, la la la
La la la, la la la
La la la la la la, la la la la la la
Ooh ooh ah ah ah

Tell me
Tell me, what's the matter with your sex?
Is fifteen minutes your best?
(Pop life)
I guess you, I guess you gotta get it off your chest
Why'd you need another love?
You know that I'm the best

I guess that's pop life
My body needs satisfaction
Pop life
I want a chemical reaction
Pop life
Everybody can't be on top
Life, it ain't real funky, unless it's got that pop

You sing now, pop life
Pop life
Pop, pop
Pop life
Pop, pop
Everybody
Life, it ain't real funky, unless it's got that

Pop life

Life, it ain't real funky, unless it's got that pop

Life, it ain't real funky, unless it's got that pop
