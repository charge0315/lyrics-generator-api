Whatever you want, baby
For all the things you've done for me
Whatever you need, baby
Cause I just want your company
And I just gotta know, I just gotta know
The way it feels
Yeah, Yeah
We can keep it chill
Only if you want

Its been a while
Since we kicked it, baby
I miss your smile, your lips, your hips, your eyes
Yeah we feel fine, forever blessed divine
And safe and sound
It's whatever you want

Whatever you need, baby

How it feels (yeah, yeah)
And we can keep it still
Only if you want

Only if you want

Only if you want (oh oh)
