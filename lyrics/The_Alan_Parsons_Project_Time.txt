Time, flowin' like a river
Time, beckoning me
Who knows when we shall meet again?
If ever
But time keeps flowin' like a river
To the sea

Goodbye, my love
Maybe for forever
Goodbye, my love
The tide waits for me
Who knows when we shall meet again?
If ever
But time keeps flowin' like a river (On and on)
To the sea, to the sea

'Til it's gone forever
Gone forever
Gone forevermore

Goodbye, my friends
(Goodbye, my love; now I'm asleep)
Maybe for forever
Goodbye, my friends
(Who knows where we shall meet again?)
The stars wait for me
Who knows where we shall meet again?
If ever
But time keeps flowin' like a river (On and on)
To the sea, to the sea

'Til it's gone forever
Gone forever
Gone forevermore

Forevermore
Forevermore
Forevermore
