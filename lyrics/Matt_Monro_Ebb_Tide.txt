First the tide rushes in
Plants a kiss on the shore
Then rolls out to sea
Then the sea is very still once more
So I rush to your side
Like the oncoming tide
With one burning thought
"Will your arms open wide?"
At last we're face to face
And as we kiss in our embrace
I can tell, I can feel
You are love, you are real
Really mine - in the rain, in the dark, in the sun!
Like the tide at its ebb
I’m at peacе in the web of your arms
At last we'rе face-to-face
And as we kiss in our embrace
I can tell, I can feel
You are love, you are real
Really mine - in the rain, in the dark, in the sun!
Like the tide at its ebb
I'm at peace in the web of your arms
