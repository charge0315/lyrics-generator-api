Your love is like bad medicine
Bad medicine is what I need
Woah-oh-oh, shake it up, just like bad medicine
There ain't no doctor that can cure my disease
(Bad medicine)

I ain't got a fever, got a permanent disease
And it'll take more than a doctor to prescribe a remedy
I got lots of money, but it isn't what I need
Gonna take more than a shot to get this poison out of me
And I got all the symptoms, count 'em, one, two, three

First, you need (That's what you get for fallin' in love)
Then you bleed (You get a little, and it's never enough)
And when you're on your knees (That's what you get for fallin' in love)
Now this boy's addicted 'cause your kiss is the drug

Woah-oh-oh, your love is like bad medicine
Bad medicine is what I need
Woah-oh-oh, shake it up, just like bad medicine
There ain't no doctor that can cure my disease

Bad, bad medicine

I don't need no needle to be givin' me a thrill
And I don't need no anesthesia or a nurse to bring a pill
I got a dirty down addiction that doesn't leave a track
I gotta jones for your affection like a monkey on my back
There ain't no paramedic gonna save this heart attack

When you need (That's what you get for fallin' in love)
Then you bleed (You get a little, but it's never enough)
And when you're on your knees (That's what you get for fallin' in love)
Now, this boy is addicted for your kiss is the drug

Woah-oh-oh, your love is like bad medicine
Bad medicine is what I need
Woah-oh-oh, shake it up, just like bad medicine
So let's play doctor, baby, cure my disease

Bad, bad medicine
Is what I want
Bad, bad medicine
Oh, it's what I need

I need a respirator 'cause I'm runnin' out of breath
You're an all-night generator wrapped in stockings and a dress
When you find your medicine, you take what you can get
'Cause if there's somethin' better, baby, well, they haven't found it yet

Woah-oh-oh, your love is like bad medicine
Bad medicine is what I need
Woah-oh-oh, shake it up, just like bad medicine
There ain't no doctor that can cure my disease
Your love, bad medicine
Bad medicine is what I need
Woah-oh-oh, shake it up, just like bad medicine
Your love's the potion that can cure my disease

Bad, bad medicine
Is what I want
Bad, bad medicine
Who's bad? Who's bad?
(Bad, bad medicine) I gotta know, I gotta, I gotta go, I gotta

I gotta, I gotta
I gotta do it again, wait a minute, wait a minute, hold on
I'm not done
One more time, with feelin'
Come on
That's all right
Help me out now

Your love is like bad medicine
Bad medicine is what I need
Woah-oh-oh, shake it up just like bad medicine
You got the potion that can cure my disease
Your love, bad medicine
Your kiss is what I need
Your love, bad medicine
