Feel better, feel good, feel wonderful
Feel better (Feel better)
Feel good (Feel good)
Feel wonderful (Feel wonderful) – hey

I could tell by the color of your energy field
You thought this game was over chemical peel
You tried to do me like my good brother Steve
But I got another funky trick up my sleeve
Expecting me to freak on you a little bit more
But you get nothing but well-wishes and flowers galore
I mean no harm, I still got your back
You can come and drink my wine, as a matter of fact

Just feel better (Feel better)
Feel good (Feel good) – hey
Feel wonderful
Feel better (Feel better)
Feel good (Feel good)
Feel wonderful

I don't know what you thought when you spit in my face
But this dimension ain't the time or the place
I don't know who told you you could stand next to me
But I got a guitar that could part the sea
Don't mean no disrespect, I ain't trying to brag
But that might be the same one that tapped on the crag
And brought forth water that quenched your thirst
And we'll keep feeding you, but first things first

Feel better (Feel better)
Feel good (Feel good) – hey
Feel wonderful (Feel wonderful)
Feel better (Feel better)
Feel good (Feel good) – hey
Feel wonderful

Sing it, feel better
Do-do-doo, do-do-doo, do-do-doo-doo
Feel good

If you think about how much time it took
For you to try to get a page in my book
I feel so good right now I just can't recall
What the ---- I was thinking when I threw you the ball
It hit three bystanders after you touched it
Now they want to sue me, but they love me too much!
'Cause they know I wish them Heaven and all of its gold!
Same to you, come on – let's groove to the Purple Rock & Roll

Feel better (Feel better)
Feel good (Feel good)
Feel wonderful (Feel wonderful)
Feel better! (Feel better)
Feel good! (Feel good) – oh!
Feel wonderful (Wonderful, oh, oh, oh)
Feel better (Feel better, baby)
Feel good (Feel good)
Feel wonderful (Y'all ready?)
(Yup)

C’mon
Better than good, better than good
You know you should feel wonderful
Keep your mind in a vertical motion
Always looking up
Hit me!

Feel better, feel good, feel wonderful
Feel better, feel good, feel wonderful
Feel better, feel good, feel wonderful
