Oh, come on, oh, come on
Oh, come on
Oh, come on, oh, come on
Oh, come on

This growin' old is gettin' old, I often find myself here thinkin'
About the birds, the boats, and past loves that flew away or started sinkin'
And it's crazy here without you, I used to think this all was ours
We'd stay up late, debate on how we'd find our way, you say it's all up in the stars

Well, some nights I rule the world
With bar lights and pretty girls
But most nights I stay straight and think about my mom
Oh god, I miss her so much

And there are people on the street, they're comin' up to me
And they're tellin' me that they like what I do now
And so I tried my best when I took the fall to get right back up, back in your arms
If you're out here why do I miss you so much?

I feel like I had it all
Back before I lost it all
Now I just wait for you to talk to me
But you won't even look at me, baby

And I'd be sayin' that you
You're always holdin' onto stars
I think they're better from afar
'Cause no one here is gonna save us
Oh, and me
Well, I have faded in the dark
So don't you ever kiss me, don't you wish on me, why can't you see
That no one's gonna save us?

Ooh, come on girl
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Oh, come on girl

I just need a helpin' hand
I close my eyes and think about tomorrow
It never came true, it came true
It never came true

Oh, and you
You're always holdin' onto stars
You're always holdin' onto stars
'Cause no one here is gonna save us
Oh, and you
You're always holdin' onto stars
I think they're better from afar
Because no one here is gonna save us
Oh, and me
Well, I am fadin' in the dark
So don't you ever kiss me, don't you wish on me, why can't you see that
No one's gonna save us? No one's gonna save us, no one's gonna save me now

No, no, no, no, no, no
No one's gonna save us
Who we are, who we are, who you are, who you are, who you are, who you are
You're always holdin' onto stars
You're always holdin' onto stars
You're always holdin' onto stars
You're always holdin' onto stars
You're always holdin' onto stars
You're always holdin' onto stars
You're always holdin' onto stars
