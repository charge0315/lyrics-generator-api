You better get a move on
Forget me when you are gone
You better get a move on
You've been here much too long
I was feeling so lonely
I simply needed someon to lean on
I feel in love with a phoney
The only man I shouldn't be keen on
Go now
I tell you once more
Go now
I show you the door
You better get a move on
Forget me when you are gone
You better get a move on
You've been here much too long
I have been loving you
Oh yes, I know it's true
But you must go, please do
Love is blind as a beetle
I didn't know you were such a teaser
Now I see like an eagle
And what I see is very displeasing
Go now
I tell you once more
Go now
I show you the door
You better get a move on
Forget me when you are gone
You better get a move on
You've been here much too long
I have been loving you
Oh yes, I know it's true
But you must go, please do
You better get a move on
Forget me when you are gone
You better get a move on
You've been here much too long
You better get a move on
Forget me when you are gone
You better get a move on
You've been here much too long
