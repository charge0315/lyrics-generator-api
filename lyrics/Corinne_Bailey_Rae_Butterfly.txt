In my mother's house
There's a photograph
Of a day gone past
Always makes me laugh
There's a little girl
Wary of the world
She got much to learn
Get her fingers burnt
An affinity
Between you and me
Was a family
Said that I'd be fine
Gave me all your time
And I left your side
Like a butterfly
Shower me with your love
Colour of everyday
You make the milk-gold Sun
Shine on me, yeah
Lift me up so high
Watch me fly away
And you give me life
Like a butterfly
In my mother's house
There was happiness
I wrapped my myself in it
Was my chrysalis
As my life unfolds
See a pattern through
Of you protecting me
And I protecting you
What was that you'd say?
"Make your own mistakes
And when you're grown
Make sure that you remain the same"
Now I realise
What was on your mind
When I left your side
Like a butterfly
Shower me with your love
Colour everyday
You make the milk-gold Sun
Shine on me, yeah
Lift me up so high
Watch me fly away
And you give me life
Like a butterfly
Shower me with your love
Colour of everyday
You make the milk-gold Sun
Shine on me, yeah
Lift me up so high
Watch me fly away
And you give me life
Like a butterfly
