I know I'm not gonna sleep tonight
'Cause you're not by my side, and that ain't right
I thought that we bought this bed for two, baby
But what good is it if I'm not with you, child?

Gimme a page on my two-way
I'll hit you back with no delay
When you hear all I've got to say
You're gonna see me
Whether in person or the phone
I've got to get you all alone
And when I do, baby, it's on
You're gonna see me
You're gonna see me

There's never a minute that I find, baby
That you don't ever cross my mind, darlin'
If you could just hold me tight you'd see, darlin'
There's nothing, there's nothing harder for you than me, baby

Gimme a page on my two-way
I'll hit you back with no delay
When you hear all I've got to say
You're gonna see me
Whether in person or the phone
I've got to get you all alone
And when I do, baby, it's on
You're gonna see me
You're gonna see me

You're the reason I took a rope and lassoed the moon
To prove that when it comes to you
There's nothing I won't do
I'd stare into the sun if you would be mine
It's not so great a leap, since to all others I am blind

I know that I'm not gonna sleep tonight
'Cause you're not by my side, and that ain't right

Gimme a page on my two-way
I'll hit you back with no delay
When you hear all I've got to say
You're gonna see me
Whether in person or the phone
(Or the phone)
I've got to get you all alone
And when I do, baby, it's on
You're gonna see me
Gimme a page on my two-way
I'll hit you back with no delay
When you hear all I've got to say
You're gonna see me
Whether in person or the phone
I've got to get you all alone
And when I do, baby, it's on
You're gonna see me
You're gonna see me
See me, see me, baby
You're gonna see me
You got to, you got to
You're gonna see me
