Switch the light off, welcome to the night
What's the problem, not gonna make it right?
Bite the bullet then pull the trigger, hold tight
(It's a feeling you know)

Running on, the lights are up in the sky
Nothing matters when you're in the fight
Hold your fire
Maybe we can make it alright
(You take, take, take, take it for no one)

But I don't know what to call it (Call it)
When I know I don't care anymore
In the end we know it's always wrong (No time, no more)

Cry out, will you tell me now?
So, we say we want change
And never be the same (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Cry out
Oh, I'm burning out
Can't you hear the sound?
(Voices all around)
('Cause we're going down)

In the moment, can't move from the start
So close, so hard to fall apart
Only heaven knows how far we are
(I take, take, take, take it for no one)

I love this feeling
You're the only one that's really lost
Never gonna get it
Never gonna get it right
(You take, take, take, take it for no one)

But I don't know what to call it (Call it)
When I know I don't care anymore
In the end I know we'll all be gone (You and I will be alright)

Cry out, will you tell me now?
So we say we want change
And never be the same (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Cry out
Oh, I'm burning out
Can't you hear the sound?

One by one it's taking apart, it's taking apart of me
Can't you hear the voices screaming?
Out loud to me, I feel it
We can be the change we needed
Shout it out now, shout it out now
Can't you hear the voices screaming?
Out loud to me, I feel it
We can be the change we needed
Shout it out now, shout it out now

Cry out, will you tell me now?
So, we say we want change
And never be the same (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Cry out
Oh, I'm burning out
Can't you hear the sound?
(Voices all around)
Can't you hear the sound?
('Cause we're going down)
(Voices all around)
('Cause we're going down)
