Take me back
Take me back
Take me back
Ah
Girls, girls, girls
Girls, girls, girls
Girls, girls, girls
Take me back

One more chance
This time around I'll get it fine, I know
One more chance
Let me undo what I've done before
One more

Girl, I be loving you like la la la
But it be hitting you like blah blah blah
We be going back and forth like volleyball
Battling each other like Galactica
Girl, our love could be spectacular
But we crash like vehicular
Homicide, I know why you sick of a
Brother with tricks that's quick to trick on ya
I know you want more than a dick in ya
You want a good nigga to stick with ya
I'll stick with ya and perfect my love
I'll protect ya, girl, if you give me just

One more chance
This time around I'll get it fine, I know
One more chance
Let me undo what I've done before
'Cause I don't wanna go
Another day, another lonely night
I don't wanna be
In this world without you in my life
One more chance

This time around, baby, protect the love
La la la la la
This time around, baby, protect the love
La la la la la
La, baby, protect the love
La la la la la
This time around, better get it right
This time around, better get it right

Lemme lemme lemme lemme love you all day (All day)
Remix our love in a new way (New way)
Put it on, put it on replay (Replay)
Spin it 'round and 'round like a DJ (DJ)
Forever and ever and always
Our endeavor got me sure like Al B
Yesterday got you feeling a little salty
Girl, I promise you I'ma love you love you all the way
To the end, L-O-V-I-N
Girl, I'm serious, no more pretending
I receive all the love you're sending
I'll give my all if you give me just

One more chance
This time around let's have a different flow
A new romance
Do the things we've never done before
'Cause I don't wanna do
The same mistakes that I made yesterday
I love you
I really love you, baby
I really love you, baby

La, baby, protect the love
La la la la la
This time around, baby, protect the love
La la la la la
La, baby, protect the love
La la la la la
This time around, better get it right
This time around, better get it right

This time around, this time around, this time around
This time around
I promise, baby, I'ma change it
I'll remix it, no more same shit
This time around, this time around, this time around
This time around
I promise, baby, I'll rearrange it
I'll remix it, no more same shit
This time around, this time around, this time around
Check it out now
Check it out now
Check it out now
Eh, eh

Fuck your friends, girl, they just haters
They just think that I'm a player
But you don't see that love is greater
If not now then maybe later
'Cause endlessly, enormously
You will see my L-O-V will be
Strong until the end
Baby, give me one more chance

This time around I'll get it fine, I know
One more chance
Let me undo what I've done before
'Cause I don't wanna go
Another day, another lonely night
I don't wanna be
In this world without you in my life
One more chance

La, la la la la la la
La la la la la
La, la la la la la la
La la la la la
La, la la la la la la
La la la la la
La, la la la la la la
La, la la la la la la
La, la la la la la la
La, la la la la la la
La, la la la la la la
