Don't you ever invite your boyfriend here
I like to be here alone
Just answer the door and feed the deer
And fight the telephone
Got to learn these words and I know you will
Or I'll send you right back to Guayaquil
Say "B'wana - he no home"
Say "B'wana - he no home"
Say "B'wana - he no home"
Say "B'wana - he no home"
Got to peel your eyes for the heat, my dear
You got to froth and foam
Got to send away the mad puppeteer
Who seems to think this is home
I want you to speak the English right
I want you to smile and be polite
Say "B'wana - he no home"
Say "B'wana - he no home"
Say "B'wana - he no home"
Say "B'wana - he no home"
I don't care if you drive my 220, honey
Don't let 'em steal my chrome
I don't care if you spend all my money, honey
Long as you leave me alone
I just want you to try to remember one thing
If somebody knocks or the telephone rings
Say "B'wana - he no home"
Say "B'wana - he no home"
Say "B'wana - he no home"
Say "B'wana - he no home"
