Is it yours
Is it mine
I was never the kind who could draw the line
Are you free
Unforgiven
Is this the kind of world you could live in
It's alright
The light is on
The darkness has run to hide
It's alright
The light is on
But the darkness is just outside
Outside your window
Beating down
Making the sound of the rain
Drive you crazy
Make you lazy
You know it's only the rain
It's alright
The light is on
The darkness has run to hide
It's alright
The light is on
But the darkness is just outside

Is it yours
Is it mine
I was never the kind who could draw the line
Are you free
Unforgiven
Is this the kind of world you could live in
It's alright
The light is on
The darkness has run to hide
It's alright
The light is on
But the darkness is just outside, yeah
Well it's alright
The light is on
The darkness has run to hide
It's alright
The light is on
But the darkness is just outside
Outside your window
