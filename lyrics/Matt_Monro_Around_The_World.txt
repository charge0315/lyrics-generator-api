Around the world I searched for you
I travelled on when hope was gone
To keep a rendezvous
I knew somewhere sometime somehow
You'd look at me and I would see
The smile you're smiling now
It might have been in county down
Or in New York or gay Paris or even London town
No more will I go all around the world
Cause I've found my world in you
It might have been in county down
Or in New York or gay Paris or even London town
No more will I go all around the world
For I have found my world in you
I've found my world in you
