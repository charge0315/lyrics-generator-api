Come unto me Lord
Come unto me Lord
Come unto me Lord
Come unto me Lord
Come unto me Lord

You cannot call this living
Letting the world take me
Out of my mind
With such heavy burdens
It's hard for one to think sometimes
I'm so down with depression
But, ain't no use in me killing myself
With your values gone
In this world there's hardly nothing left

Sweet
Sweet
Such restlessness, such emphasis, sweet exorcist
Woman I love you

Sometimes it's raining
And all around
It's like a, a thickening cloud
But the love she gives
It makes me feel so Black and proud, mmm mmm mmm
So very mystifying
Flutters my heart like the Lord
Is calling me home
Oh baby, you make it so hard for a man to sleep alone

Sweet
Sweet
Such restlessness, such emphasis, sweet exorcist
Woman, I love you

I believe in the spirit
I know, I know I believe in the spirit
Traveling soul, was alone part of me
Out in this world
It don't take your eyes too long to see

Sweet
Sweet
Such restlessness, such emphasis, sweet exorcist
Woman, I love you
