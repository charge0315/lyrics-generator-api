Baby, rock dust light star
('kay, that's the one...)

Rock dust light star
And it's comin' at you, baby, yeah

I'm the man on the moon
I hope I'm not come back too soon
Am I the only one to see the light?
No use in gettin' down upon your knees tonight
So I don't feel love
Because I got no faith
I've seen those twisted lies thrown back into my face
I've heard the crazy doctrines of the human race
I must be alone
How could it be?
Your gift to me (to me)
A salvo of heavy artillery (baby, no)
It's nothin' but your war
You can call it what you like
I know where I'm from
And it's cold and dark
Cause all the sinners are just saints without sparks (ooh...)
I'm having trouble tellin' them apart, oh yeah

Comin' at you
Rock dust light star
Comin' at you, baby
Thirty six thousand miles an hour (miles an hour!)
Rock dust light star
Comin' at you, baby, what you're made of, what you are

Now look and see
Those stars for you and me
Waiting like silent killers in the night (in the night)
Atomic legions that you can never fight (can never fight)
I've never felt
(I never felt)
I ever prayed
(I ever prayed)
Don't have to join in with in the other slaves
I'm not the only one who feels betrayed, yeah
See, the more I think about it
I'm goin' against the grain
Ooh, I won't be born again
Salvation's comin' from on high
(Comin' at you, baby)
(Through the sky)
(From on high, yeah!)
Rock dust light star
Comin' at you, baby
Thirty six thousand miles an hour
(miles an hour!)
Rock dust light star
Comin' at you, baby, what you're made of, what you are
Rock dust light star
Comin' at you, baby
Thirty six thousand miles an hour
(miles an hour!)
Rock dust light star
Comin' at you, baby, what you're made of, what you are
Rock dust light - star
Rock dust light - star
I'm a square peg in a round hole
Maybe there's no place left for my wounded soul
Maybe the king of kings finally lost control of it
(Comin' at you, baby)
Rock dust light star
Comin' at you, baby
Thirty six thousand miles an hour
Kill it -
(salvation's comin'!)
Comin' at you baby
Thirty six thousand miles an hour
(From on high, salvation's comin'!)
Comin' at you baby
What you're made of, what you are
Look up and see
Those stars for you and me
Look up and see
Rock dust light star
Comin' at you baby
(From on high, yeah!)
Rock dust light star
