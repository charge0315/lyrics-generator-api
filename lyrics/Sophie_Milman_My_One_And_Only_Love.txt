The very thought of you
Makes my heart sing
Like an april breeze
On the wings of spring
And you will be in all your splendor
My one and only love
The shadow's fall and spread
Their mystique charms in the hush of night
While i'm in your arms
I feel your lips, so warm and tender
My one and only love
The touch of your hand, is like heaven
A heaven that i've never known
And the blush on your cheek
Whenever i speak
Tells me that you are my own
You fill my eager heart
With such desire
Every kiss you give
Sets my soul on fire
I give myself in sweet surrender
My one and only love
The touch of your hand, is like heaven
A heaven that i've never known
And the blush on your cheek
Whenever i speak
Tells me that you are my own
You fill my eager heart
With such desire
Every kiss you give
Sets my soul on fire
I give myself in sweet surrender
My one and only love
