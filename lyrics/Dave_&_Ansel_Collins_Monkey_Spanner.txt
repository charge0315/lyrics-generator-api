This is!
A heavy, heavy monster sound
Hitting you smack there, right there in the middle
An' rev it right on
Heavy, heavy, ain't it heavy
Get up-get up, baby
A heavy monster sound
Hittin' you smack there, right there in the middle
Rocking, socking an' more shocking
Get up, get up, baby
Get up, get on up, get up no-no baby
Rock it on me-shake it on me
A heavy monster sound
Rock it right on
Work it
Now hear me
Work it on me-shake it on me
Shake it on me now, baby
Work it on me now I don't mean maybe
Comin' on strong
All day long
Hail I
Don't stop-no fuss an' fight
Revving right on
Good God, yeah, Baby
Good God, I don't mean maybe
Work it on me-shake it on me
Heavy, ain't that really heavy
Work it on me, shake it on me
Heavy, it's really, really, really heavy
Sock it on me-rock it on me now
