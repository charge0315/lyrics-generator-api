Every time the rain comes down
Close my eyes and listen
I can hear the lonesome sound
Of the sky as it cries

Listen to the rain
Here it comes again
Hear it in the rain

Feel the touch of tears that fall
They won't fall forever
In the way the day will flow
All things come, all things go

Listen to the rain
The rain
Here it comes again
Again
Hear it in the rain
The rain

Late at night I drift away
I can hear you calling
And my name is in the rain
Leaves on trees whispering
Deep blue sea's mysteries

Even when this moment ends
Can't let, go this feeling
Everything will come again
In the sound, falling down
Of the sky as it cries
Hear my name in the rain
