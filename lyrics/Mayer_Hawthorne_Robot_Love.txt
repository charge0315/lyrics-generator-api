I'm a lover with robot veins
Pumping Valvoline to my robot brain
Switch me on, see the glowing light
I'm programmable, I can go all night

But lately I've been feeling oh so cold
And every night's the same
I can't keep going through the motions
Again and again, and again

When we're makin’ love
Don't just treat me like a sex machine
Cause it's not enough
You got to give a little more for me

Under the covers
It's a one-way road
We've got to care for one another or this game is gonna get real old
You used to wear Agent Provocateur
A chiffon gown movin’ 'round, accentuating your voluptuous curves
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

But lately I've been feeling oh so cold
And every night's the same
I can't keep going through the motions
Again and again, and again

When we're makin’ love
Don't just treat me like a sex machine
Cause it's not enough
You got to give a little more for me
When we're makin’ love
Don't just treat me like a sex machine
Cause it's not enough
You got to give a little more for me

Give it to me baby
Give it to me baby
Give it to me baby
Yeah give it to me baby
Give it to me baby
Give it to me baby
Give it to me baby

When we're makin’ love
Don't just treat me like a sex machine
Cause it's not enough
You got to give a little more for me
When we're makin’ love
Don't just treat me like a sex machine
Cause it's not enough
You got to give a little more for me
