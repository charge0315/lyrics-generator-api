I told you time and again
If you don't do right
I'll find another man
You're losing me baby
And I just let you know, Know it
You're losing me daddy
And I just
And I just gotta show it
I know you've got someone else
I can tell by the way you carry yourself, now
Right now I'm so disgusted
Seem like no man can be trusted
You're losing me baby
And I just wanna let you know it
You're losing me daddy
And I just
And I just gotta show it
Yeah, Yeah
Baby, You're losing me
The day we got married
I noticed the way you said "I do"
But it didn't dawn on me, honey
Till after a year or two
But how you changed on me
I was too blind to see
But Daddy you're gonna lose mе now
Baby You're gonna lose me
Ohh honеy you're gonna lose me
You're losing me baby, Oh ya
You're losing me, Honey
You're losing me
