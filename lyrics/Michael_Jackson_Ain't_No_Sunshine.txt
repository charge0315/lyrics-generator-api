You ever want something
That you know you shouldn't have
The more you know you shouldn't have it
The more you want it
And then one day, you get it
It's so good to you
But it's just like my girl
When she's around me
I just feel so good, so good
But right now, I just feel cold, so cold
Right down to my bones
'Cause ooh

Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
It's not warm when she's away
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
And she's always gone too long
Anytime she goes away, hey

Wonder this time where she's gone
Wonder if she's gone to stay
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
And this house just ain't no home
Anytime she goes away
(Anytime she goes away) Mmm

I know, I know, I know, I know
Oh, I know, I know, I know, know
I know, know, know, know, know
Oh, I know, I know
Hey, I ought to leave (Ought to leave)
I ought to leave her alone
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
(Ain't no sunshine when she's gone)

Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
(Ain't no sunshine when she's gone)
Only darkness every day
(Only darkness every day)
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
And this house just ain't no home
Anytime she goes away
(Anytime she goes away)

(Ain't no sun) Oh
(Ain't no sun)
(Na-na-na-na na-na-na) Oh
(Na-na-na) Oh, oh
Anytime she goes away

Ain't no sun
(Ain't no sunshine when she's gone)
When she's gone
(It's not warm when she's away)
It's not warm when she's away
(Ain't no sunshine when she's gone)
And she's always gone too long
Anytime she goes away

(Ain't no sunshine when she's gone)
(It's not warm when she's away)
Anytime she goes away
(Only darkness every day)
(Ain't no sunshine when she's gone)
Whenever that little girl goes away
Na, na, na, na, na
(It's not warm when she's away)
(Only darkness every day)
Anytime she goes away
(Ain't no sunshine when she's gone) Come on, now
(Ain't no sunshine when she's gone)
Come on, baby, anytime she goes away
(Only darkness every day) Na, na, na
(Ain't no sunshine when she's gone)
Oh, anytime she goes away
(Ain't no sunshine when she's gone) Na-na-na, oh
(Ain't no sunshine when she's gone)
Anytime when she goes away
(Ain't no sunshine when she's gone) Oh
(Ain't no sunshine when she's gone)
