I’ve been watch you form afar
I even know who you are
When no one nows your name
I’ve, I’ve seen your face in the crowd
I’ve been there where you are now
When your just turning time
Let yourself be part of something new, tonight
Take a chance and go inside of you
We both know what you can do
Got one more night to discover something
Better, something better, something better
You have all these thoughts in your mind
When all you need is my time
Yet they still think you’re bad
But all, of these changes I discover in me, they came so naturally
Whenever we go down
Let yourself be part of something new tonight
Take a chance and go inside of you
We both know what you can do
Got one more night to discover something
Better something better
One more night to discover something better
Better, something better, something better
Give me something
Give me something
I’m talking bout a friend of mine we spent some time  and she touched my soul
Made me let go
See this dream that she’d been looking for was right outside her door and I showed her
Yes I saw her
Lady Karis, woman indeed
You got so much coming
Let yourself be a part of something new tonight
Take a chance and lets go inside of you
We both know what you can do
One more night to discover something
Just let yourself
Be part of something new, we both know what you can do
Give me something
