Bring me back the good old days
When you let me misbehave
Always knew it wouldn't last
But if you ask, I'd go again
Yeah, I'd go again

It's alright, it's okay
I don't need you anyway
You don't have to tell the truth
'Cause if you do, I'll tell it too
Oh, I'll tell it too

Well, it ain't easy to stay in love if you can't tell lies
So I'll just have to take a bow and say goodbye

I'm loosened up, but it's too late to turn it around
I'm dropping bolts on the ground and I'm coming unwound

Don't you miss the good old days
When I let you misbehave?
While you're looking down like that
I know that you're dying to come back
Please come on back

Well, it ain't easy to stay in love when you're telling lies
So I'll just have to take a bow and say goodbye
