Sunlight opened up my eyes
To see for the first time, it opened them up
And tonight, rivers will run dry
Not for the first time, rivers will run

Hundreds of years in the future
There could be computers lookin' for life on Earth
Don't fight for the wrong side
Say what you feel like, say how you feel

You'll go backwards, but then
You'll go forwards again
You'll go backwards, but then
You'll go

Created, then drilled and invaded
If somebody made it, someone will mess it up
And you are not wrong to
Ask, "Who does this belong to?" It belongs to all of us

You'll go backwards, but then
You'll go forwards again
You'll go backwards, but then
You'll go forwards
You'll go backwards, but then
You'll go forwards again
You'll go backwards, but then
You'll go forwards
