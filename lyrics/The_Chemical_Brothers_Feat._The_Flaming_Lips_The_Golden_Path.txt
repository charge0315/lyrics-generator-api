As I walked along the supposed golden path
I was confronted by a mysterious spectre
He pointed to the graveyard over on yonder hill
I paused in cosmic reflection, confused and wondering
Of how I came to die, to die, to die
Hmmm I was confused
For if I was dead, how and why did I die?
But I composed myself and decided I should face him
But I stood paralyzed on the supposed golden path
And I was confronted by a powerful demon force
And they said it was the devil
And when he spoke his words flowed like glowing lava
From the mouth of a volcano
And I said, "Help me, Lord"
I found myself in some kind of hell
But I did not believe in a heaven-and-hell world-in-opposite's kind of reality
And I gained control of myself and I decided to press on
And as I walked along the supposed golden path
I was trembling with fear, all the lions and wizards yet to come
I seen in the distance silver mountains rising high in the clouds
And voice from above did whisper some shining answer from the womb
Please forgive me, I never meant to hurt you
Please forgive me, I never meant to hurt you
Please forgive me, I never meant to hurt you
Please forgive me, I never meant to hurt you
As I walked along
Please forgive me, I never meant to hurt you
As I walked along
Please forgive me, I never meant to hurt you
Please forgive me, I never meant to hurt you
Please forgive me, I never meant to hurt you
