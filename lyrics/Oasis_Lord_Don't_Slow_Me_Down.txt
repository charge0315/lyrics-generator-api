Well I'm tired and I'm sick
I got a habit that I just can't kick
I feel hungover and I'm all in love
Let the lights go down
I'm gonna shoot 'em up
It's alright, don't be afraid
You gotta keep dreaming in the bed you made
And if it tastes like shit
Well, it beats sleeping rough on the floor

You keep saying
That my head's locked up in the clouds
But keep praying
That the Lord won't slow me down

Well, I'm tired and I'm sick
I got a habit that a cat won't lick
I feel hungover and I'm all in love
Let the lights go down
Me and you are gonna shoot 'em up

You keep saying
That my head's locked up in the clouds
But keep praying
That the Lord won't slow me down

Well, I'm tired and I'm sick
I got a habit that I just can't kick
I feel hungover and I'm all in love
When the lights go down
Me and you are gonna shoot 'em up
