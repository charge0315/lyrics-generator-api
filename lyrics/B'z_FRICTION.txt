Living in this boring world (Oh yeah)
Every day just passing by (Oh yeah)
Nobody's fault, I'm making my choice all the time
Oh, standing still feet on the run (Oh yeah)
Stare at the sky, never see the sun (Oh yeah)
In and out of mind still searching for a sign, oh yeah

Something is wrong
We're losing our senses
I really need to know what I am

Shouting out my name (Shouting out)
Tryin' to find my way (Finding out)
I just need a new sensation (I just need a new sensation)
Oh, can't just sit and die (No, I can't)
Baby, I'll come alive (For myself)
Pull the thread from all these stitches
We can't make it without friction

Uncivilized, this modern world (Oh yeah)
Feed the poor with empty words (Oh no)
They're just killing time and thinking no one would mind, yeah

What's going on?
Everything in a haze
I'm not hiding anymore

Shouting out my name (Shouting out)
Walking down Broadway (Hold up your hand)
I just got a new direction (I just got a new direction)
Oh, maybe I'd better fight (Lock your door)
I gotta live my life (For myself)
Won't be scared to lose everything, yeah

Shouting out my name
Try to make you see my face
Now I'm gonna do it my way (Now I'm gonna do it my way)
Baby, I gotta fight (Lock your door)
Fight for my life (For myself)
Ain't nothin' that I won't be missin'
Nothing happens without friction
Oh yeah

Ooh
Yeah
