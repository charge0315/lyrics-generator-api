Everybody's talking 'bout the seventh son
In the whole round world there's only one
I'm the one
Yes, I'm the one
I'm the one, I'm the one
The one they call the seventh son
I can tell your future, it will come to pass
I can do things for you, make your heart feel glad
Look in the sky, predict the rain
I can tell when a woman's got another man
I'm the one
Yes, I'm the one
I'm the one, I'm the one
The one they call the seventh son
I can hold you close, I can squeeze you tight
Make you cry for me both day and night
I heal the sick and raise the dead
I make little girls talk out of their heads
I'm the one
Yes, I'm the one
I'm the one, I'm the one
The one they call the seventh son
I can talk these words that will sound so sweet
Even make your little heart skip a beat
I can heal the sick and raise the dead
Make little girls talk out of their heads
I'm the one
The one they call the seventh son
I'm the one, I'm the one
The one they call the seventh son
I'm the one, I'm the one
I'm the one, I'm the one
I'm the one, I'm the one
The one they call the seventh son
I'm the one, I'm the one
The one they call the seventh son
Yeah-e-yeah
