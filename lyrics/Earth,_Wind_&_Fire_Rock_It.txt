Yeah, peace!
To all the wonderful people
On the East, on the West, in the North, in the South
Yea, EWF comin' at ya '96 style
Let us run it down to y'all now
Energy inspires
Dino hypes da place 'pon bass how
Crowds heat up the fire
'95 found high Night flyin'
Tight as Sonny E
Mo Pleasure chords towards
Groovin' yours
We mash up St. Marteen
(And it's all good)

We dig each gig together
