Hey baby
There's something on my mind
Got to tell you
I never thought I'd find
Love that is simple and so kind (so kind)
Love that is caring so divine (so divine)
Your love has got a handle on my mind
Sweet as cherry
Fine like wine
Gonna love you 'til the end of time
Hey baby come put your arms in mine
Let's make love
Cause I need to take that ride
I'm on the top of the world (world)
Cause you're my baby and I'm your girl
Your love has got a handle on my mind
Sweet as cherry
Fine like wine
Gonna love you 'til the end of time
Put your sweet little lips over mine
And open wide
When we're together I just can't hide
Cause we've got a beautiful vibration
And we've got a beautiful situation
Your love has got a handle on my mind
Sweet as cherry
Fine like wine
Gonna love you 'til the end of time
