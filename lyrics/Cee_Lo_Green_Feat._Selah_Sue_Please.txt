I’m tired (I'm tired), so tired (so tired), of chasing the dreams
With tears in my eyes I realize that it’s running away
(It’s running away)
But with all the wrong I’ve done
How could love ever love me?
'Cause I've even tried, talking to the sky about it
But there’s not much to say
Not much to say
So please, please, please
Give me some kind of sign
Please, please, please, please, please
I want to be somebody, somebody
I want someone to be mine
Please, please, please, please, please
The man, the man in the mirror
Oh he won’t even look at me
Well, you may not believe it, but my own reflection
Told me I ought to be ashamed of myself
Oh yes he did
I’m wasting my time, my time, my mind, my mind, my energy
Even let my body down on the bed, oh yeah!
But I can’t seem to win for losing
‘cause don’t nobody love me yet, oh well
So I’m begging please, please, yeah, please
Send me some kind of sign, please
I want, I want to be somebody
I want someone to be all mine
I’m begging please, yeah, please, someone, please, please, someone please
I said, I want to be somebody, I want someone to be all mine
Someone, someone, I want someone
Sometimes I got to move along
I say hum
