On the West Side, there's a stuff wide space
Down in the basement of a secret place
People there don't mind, 'cause everybody's got time
Close relations with the people you know
Kind of funky, but you don't wanna go
Happy for the love I found
We're celebrating all over town
Hold on, hold on, baby
Let me take you higher.  (Higher)
Higher.  (Higher)
Shake it, shake it, baby
Set my baby on fire
Soul music is so pretty when you're living in the city
Swinging in and out, to and fro
Why she want me, that, I don't know
Just the way I wanna be
She likes to keep me free
Grooving in, sucking in with the beat
Stopping hands on the good fine meat
She sure likes to walk with me with the soul music
Just continue to shout
Let me take you higher.  (Higher)
Higher.  (Higher)
Shake it, shake it, baby
Set your baby on fire
Soul music is so pretty when you're living in the city
Feel a tingle all in my pants
I can make it if I take a chance
Can't go nowhere
Just wanna dance with the soul music
Soul music
Soul music
Soul
Soul
Come on, come on, baby
Let me take you higher.  (Higher)
Higher.  (Higher)
Shake it, shake it, baby
Set my baby on fire
Soul music is so pretty when you're living in the city
On the West Side, there's a stuff wide space
Down in the basement of a secret place
Where people there don't mind
'Cause everybody's got time with the soul music
Everybody walks soul music
Everybody talks soul music
Soul
Soul
Hold on, hold on, baby
Let me take you higher.  (Higher)
Higher.  (Higher)
Shake it, shake it, baby
Set my baby on fire
Soul music is so pretty when you're living in the city
Swinging in and out, to and fro
Why she want me, that, I don't know
Just the way I wanna be
She likes to keep me free
She likes to walk with me.  (Soul)
She likes to talk with me.  (Soul)
Moving in and out
She likes to move on up
