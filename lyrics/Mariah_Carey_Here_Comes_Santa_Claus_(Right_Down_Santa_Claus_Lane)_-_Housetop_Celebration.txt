Here comes Santa Claus
Here comes Santa Claus
Right down Santa Claus Lane
Vixen and Blitzen, and all his reindeer
Pulling on the reins
Bells are ringing
Children singing
All is merry and bright
Hang your stockings with Christmas cheer
'Cause Santa Claus comes tonight

Oh ho ho, who wouldn't go
Oh ho ho, who wouldn't go
Up on the house top
Click click click
'Cause Santa Claus comes tonight

So gather 'round, gather 'round
Until night becomes the day
Gather 'round, gather 'round
We're gonna have a good time and celebrate

'Twas the night before Christmas
When all through the house
Not a creature was stirring
Not even a mouse
Yeah
That's how they get it
T'was on Christmas night
Ya know what I'm saying

So gather 'round, gather 'round
Until night becomes the day
Gather 'round, gather 'round
We're gonna have a good time and celebrate

Oh ho ho, who wouldn't go
Oh ho ho, who wouldn't go
Up on the house top
Click click click
'Cause Santa Claus comes tonight

Here comes Santa Claus
Here comes Santa Claus
Right down Santa Claus Lane
Vixen and Blitzen, and all his reindeer
Pulling on the reins
Bells are ringing
Children singing
All is merry and bright
Hang your stockings with Christmas cheer
'Cause Santa Claus is coming tonight

Santa Claus is coming tonight
Santa Claus is coming tonight
Santa Claus is coming tonight
