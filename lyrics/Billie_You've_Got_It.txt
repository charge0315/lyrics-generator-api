You've got what I want
You've got what I need
One touch from you
Brings me to my knees
You've got what I want
Baby can't you see
That no-one else
Will do for me

It's three am no matter
How hard I try, I can't sleep
I close my eyes into my
Imagination you creep
I can almost feel your touch
Washing over me
I'm wishing so hard
That I believe

We had said things
That we don't mean
All the morning light's
Brought reality
If I need you
And you need me
So don't stop
Let's get it on
Babe I miss you
All night long

You've got what I want
You've got what I need
One touch from you
Brings me to my knees
You've got what I want
Baby can't you see
That no-one else
Will do for me

Don't judge the past
Babe it's only history
And let's accept that you and I
Were always meant to be
Step back into my life
Out of my fantasy
I've got a situation remedy

I told another
Lady tonight
Surrender to the
Feeling down inside
If I need you
And you need me
So don't stop
Let's get it on
Babe I miss you
All night long

You've got what I want
You've got what I need
One touch from you
Brings me to my knees
You've got what I want
Baby can't you see
That no-one else
Will do for me

You've got what I want
One touch from you
You've got what I want
Baby can't you see
That no-one else
Will do for me

If I need you
And you need me
So don't stop
Let's get it on
Babe I miss you
All night long

You've got what I want
You've got what I need
One touch from you
Brings me to my knees
You've got what I want
Baby can't you see
That no-one else
Will do for me
You've got what I want
You've got what I need
One touch from you
Brings me to my knees
You've got what I want
Baby can't you see
That no-one else
Will do for me
