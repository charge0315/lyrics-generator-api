Mr Davies lives in a big house
In a town called L.A
He drinks champagne for breakfast
In his swimming pool
He has a sister named Victoria
She lives somewhere in Australia
To visit her he takes his private jet
He's now a gifted pilor
He doesn't care for his brother
No more place in the picture book
And he gives me complexes
Because he's considered a songwriter
And I'm not at this time...
When Mr Davis goes shopping
He says hello to David... Charlie Watts
He gave up pop music
To play squash with Ringo Starr
But that does not matter
When you listen to his selected discography
And he gives me complexes
Because he's considered a songwriter
And I'm not at this time
