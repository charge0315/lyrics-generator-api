When the days start slipping by
And there's no time to stop and reason why
Up there's the sun and it's bright
There 'll be a million tomorrows tonight
'Cause I'll be your Rock and Rock Slave
I'll be your warm sunny day
I'll be your star in the sky
'Cause I'm yours 'til the day I die
That old wind won't knock you down
Once you know no one can push you around
And if you search heavens above
You'll always find me 'cause I'm the one you love
Well I'll be your Rock and Rock Slave
I'll be your warm sunny day
I'll be your star in the sky
'Cause I'm yours 'til the day I die
Anyway you go you know you're going my way
I'll bе right beside you evеn when those blues get to you
We can make it okay
'Cause I'll be your Rock and Rock Slave
I'll be your warm sunny day
I'll be your star in the sky
'Cause I'm yours 'til the day I die
I'll be your Rock and Rock Slave
I'll be your warm sunny day
I'll be your star in the sky
'Cause I'm yours 'til the day I die
I'm yours 'til the day I die
Yes I am
