Who knows my love
What the future brings
All the unknown things that may come along
What tomorrow holds
They say my love, life can be unkind
Bring a peace of mind
A dream can go wrong
That's what we've been taught
But I don't care

If you are there
Lay with me all the way
Nothing can stop me
Nothing can make me afraid
If you are there
I'll be okay
La la la la
La la la la laaa
La la la la laaa
La la la laa
La la la la laaa
They say my love, life can be unkind
Bring a peace of mind
A dream can go wrong
That's what we've been taught
But I don't care

If you are there
Lay with me all the way
Nothing can stop me
Nothing can make me afraid
If you are there
I'll be okay
