Come in

Very adept in the art of healin'
A voice spoke up to her sayin', "Come in"
She's lost her words, describin' the feeling
Whatever it is, it never end, no, uh-uh

Very adept in the art of listening
She studied everything she needed to know
Her dreams now turned to the water glistening
And the words come in and go
Come in and go

To a place where time it has no meaning
And a space where there are no more walls
Very adept in the art of receiving
She finally got the call

Come in
Come in
Go
Immersion
Immersion

Very adept in the art of releasing
She let all of her inhibitions go
With the unexpected shock of a bee sting
She got pulled into the future
And into the new world
Into the new world
Into the new world
Into the new world
Into the new world
Into the new world
Into the new world
Into the new world
Into the new world
Welcome to the place much faster than time
The true reality, where only peace you'll find

Come in
Come in
Go
Immersion, immersion, immersion
Go
