What's happening next?
What'cha gonna do?
What'cha gonna do if she breaks your heart now?
What'cha gonna do if steals your soul?
Something must happen very quickly
That's all
What'cha gonna do?
What's happening next?
What'cha gonna do if her love is real?
Aren't ya gonna tell her the way you feel?
Make up your mind, it's taking far too long
What'cha gonna do?
I know it sounded scary
What'cha gonna do?
Everything will work out fine
Why do you always have to complicate
Everything in your life
Just take a break
Can't you find a way to appreciate
Everything in your life
It's going great
It's just a start
Open up your heart
I know it sounded scary
When everything was working fine
So go ahead and hurry
Don't you waste no more time
