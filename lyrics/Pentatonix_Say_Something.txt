Say something, I'm giving up on you
I'll be the one, if you want me to
Anywhere, I would've followed you
Say something, I'm giving up on you

And I am feeling so small
It was over my head
I know nothing at all
And I will stumble and fall
I'm still learning to love
Just starting to crawl

Say something, I'm giving up on you
I'm sorry that I couldn't get to you
Anywhere, I would've followed you
Say something, I'm giving up on you

And I will swallow my pride
You're the one that I love
And I'm saying goodbye

Say something, I'm giving up on you (Say something, say something, say something)
I'll be the one, if you want me to (Say something, say something)

Say something, I'm giving up on you
I'll be the one, if you want me to
Say something, I'm giving up on you
I'll be the one, if you want me to
Say, say something, I'm giving up on you (I'm giving up)
I'll be the one, if you want me to (Be the one, want me to)

Say, say something, I'm giving up on you (Say something, I'm giving up)
I'll be the one, if you want me to (If you want me to, if you want me to)
Anywhere I would've followed you
Say something (Say something)
Say something (Say something)
Say something (Say something)
I

Say something, I'm giving up on you
