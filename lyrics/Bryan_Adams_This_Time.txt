I think about her all the time
She's my fantasy
An image burnin' in my mind
Callin' out to me
While my imagination's runnin' wild
Yeah, things are getting clearer
Oh, this time, everything is all right
No way she's gonna get away
This time, everything is easy
Any day, I'm gonna make her mine
I've thought of every word I'd say
Give or take a few
But she turns and slowly walks away
What do I have to do?
Hey, turn up your radio
Oh, there's somethin' I want you to know
Yeah, this time, everything is all right
No way she's gonna get away
This time, everything is easy
Any day, I'm gonna make her mine
Yeah, I'm gonna make her mine
This time
It's hard to take 'cause she's miles away
And I've waited a long time
But the feelin's right and darlin', one of these nights
Yeah, I'm gonna let you know
Oh, this time, everything is all right
No way she's gonna get away
This time, everything is easy
Any day, I'm gonna make her mine
This time, everything is all right
No way she's gonna get away
This time, everything is easy
Any day, I'm gonna make her mine
Yeah, I'm gonna make her mine
Oh, yeah, this time
