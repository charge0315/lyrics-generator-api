Like a sting of a bee
I was stung by your sweet love before
And like a child at a play
I was sure that I would even the score

A bee loves honey
And you still attract me

And if I don't watch out
I'll fall in love with you again (Falling, falling, keep falling)
And if I don't watch out
I'll fall in love with you again (Falling, falling, keep falling)

I was trapped like a fly
That is caught within a spider's web
No, you won't catch me twice
'Cause I won't be made a fool again
But your love was tempting
Don't make me give in

'Cause if I don't watch out
I'll fall in love with you again (Falling, falling, keep falling)
'Cause if I don't watch out
I'll fall in love with you again (Falling, falling, keep falling)

A bee loves honey
And you still attract me

And if I don't watch out
I'll fall in love with you again
And if I don't watch out
I'll fall in love with you again
And if I don't watch out
I'll fall in love with you again
And if I don't watch out
I'll fall in love with you again
