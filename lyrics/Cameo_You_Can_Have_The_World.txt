Some people say that this is the truth
There are no dreams, no lasting youth
If they lived like us it wouldn't be hard to tell
Just what is Heaven and where is Hell?
So keep on the good foot, be happy
Your dreams are yours to keep (Yeah)
Don't be a victim now of these mean streets
If it's worth all the trouble to bust your butt just to be new
Keep the faith, baby, it can happen for you

You can have the world if you want it
Don't let circumstances stop you, opportunity will rock you
Have the world if you want it
(Chances are you'll find) You're gonna make it (Ooh)

Gonna make it through
You're gonna make it through, yeah
Yeah

You do the best that you can do
Everything will come to you
Stop procrastinatin'
Your neck off, aww
If you wonder why they sneer
Take the time to comb your hair
Wash your face and hands
Look the best you can
It takes a minute to find
Success and a peace of mind
It might be hard, but it you can do it
If you put your heart into it
A-just get a picture in your mind
Every detail well-defined
And chances are you're gonna find you—

You can have the world if you want it
Don't let circumstances stop you, opportunity will rock you
You can have the world if you want it
(Ooh) You're gonna make it

Mm-mm
Ooh-oh
Ooh, oh, oh
You're gonna make it
Gonna make it, oh
Nothing can stop me now
No, no
Yeah
Ooh, woah, ooh, woah
If you want it (If you want it)
You can have the world, you're gonna make it
If you want it
Have the world
