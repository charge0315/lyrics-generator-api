Didn't they always say we were the lucky ones?
I guess that we were once, babe, we were once
But luck will leave you cursed, it is a faithless friend
And in the end, when life has got you down
You've got someone here that you can wrap your arms around

So hold on to me tight
Hold on to me tonight
We are stronger here together
Than we could ever be alone
So hold on to me
Don't you ever let me go

There's a thousand ways for things to fall apart
But it's no ones fault, no, it's not our fault, no
Maybe all the plans we made might not work out
But I have no doubt, even though it's hard to see
I've got faith in us, and I believe in you and me

So hold on to me tight
Hold on, I promise it will be alright
'Cause it's you and me together
And, baby, all we've got is time
So hold on to me
Hold on to me tonight

And there's so many dreams that we have given up
Take a look at all we've got
And with this kind of love
And what we've got here is enough

So hold on to me tight
Hold on, I promise it will be alright
'Cause we are stronger here together
Than we could ever be alone
Just hold on to me
Don't you ever let me go
Hold on to me, it's gonna be alright
Hold on to me tonight

Didn't they always say we were the lucky ones?
