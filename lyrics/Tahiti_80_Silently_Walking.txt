Silently walking on unfamiliar street
I'm trying to prevent
A flow of emotions from running
All over me
I wish I could keep this memory
Alive inside of me
I wish I could keep this memory
Alive inside of me
This light is strange
The colors are rearranged
I take a look at the butterflies
Turning madly above me
I wish I could keep this memory
Alive inside of me
I wish I could keep this memory
Alive inside of me
No one's gonna make
This feeling happen again
No one's gonna make
This memory happen again
Silently walking on unfamiliar street
I'm trying to prevent
The butterflies from flying
Away from me
