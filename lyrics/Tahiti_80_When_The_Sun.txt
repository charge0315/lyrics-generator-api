When the sun appears in the sky
When the moon slips away with the dark
You've been awake of a long time
Yes it's true
You're not sleeping like so many others do
Nightime isn't the shelter
It's supposed to be
Especially when you're sad
You ride the mares at night
Even if you don't want to
Even if you don't want to
Nighttime, nighttime...
