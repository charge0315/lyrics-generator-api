L.O.V.E
I climb in bed
She's distracted
Flipping pages
Asking for the matches
Cigarette smoke hangs
Just like a curtain
Makes me wonder
Is her love for certain?
I see the truth now
She gave me the blues today
She turns the lights out
Whenever I want to play

L.O.V.E
But she don't get the message
All I ever wanted was your love
All I ever needed was your love
Our love is dyin'
On the cold sheets
Body aching
To warm a heart with no heat
Just one whisper
Of the "L" word
Makes her shiver
She touches love with cold feet
My desire
I don't wanna lose this dream
She lights my fire
That girls it what's wrong with me
(Chorus)

L's the word that I heard
From your lips, your hips, your fingertips
L's the word in the wind
Love has touched my heart again
L's the word to be heard
From your lips, your hips, your fingertips
(Chorus)
(Bridge)

(L.O.V.E.)

(L.O.V.E.)
L's the word that I heard
L's the word that I heard
L's the word that I heard
L's the word that I heard
From your lips, your hips, your fingertips
From your lips, your hips, your fingertips
(Vamp)
