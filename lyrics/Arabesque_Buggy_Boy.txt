Buggy boy, buggy boy
Take me for a ride
Buggy boy, buggy boy
Drive me through the night
Yon know the way, buggy boy
You are OK, buggy boy
All of us girls go crazy
We're walking up and down
Buggy boy's car is chasing girls in town
Happy hips wildly swaying
Trying to make him stop
Hoping he will be saying:
"Come on get in my buggy baby"
Buggy boy, buggy boy
Take me for a ride
Buggy boy, buggy boy
Drive me through the night
Yon know the way, buggy boy
You are OK, buggy boy
Traffic lights are changing
Like I've never seen
When buggy boy only glances
They turn green
His magic eyes are shining
Spotting a red haired girl
For her there's no more pining
"Come on get in my buggy baby"
Buggy boy, buggy boy
Take me for a ride
Buggy boy, buggy boy
Drive me through the night
Yon know the way, buggy boy
You are OK, buggy boy
Buggy boy, buggy boy
Take me for a ride
Buggy boy, buggy boy
Drive me through the night
Yon know the way, buggy boy
You are OK, buggy boy
