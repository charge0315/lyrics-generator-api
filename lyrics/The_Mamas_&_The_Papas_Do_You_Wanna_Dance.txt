Do you wanna dance under the moonlight
Squeeze me all through the night
Oh baby, do you wanna dance
Do you wanna dance and hold my hand
Tell me I'm your lover man
Oh-oh, baby, do you wanna dance
Do you wanna dance and make romance
Come on, pretty baby, and take a chance
Hey, baby (Oh baby, do you wanna dance)
(Do you...) Do you, do you, do you, do you wanna dance
(Do you...) Do you, do you, do you, do you wanna dance
(Do you...) Do you, do you, do you, do you, do you wanna dance
Do you wanna dance under the moonlight
Squeeze me all through the night
Oh-oh baby, do you wanna dance
(Do you...) Do you, do you, do you, do you wanna dance
(Do you...) Do you, do you, do you, do you wanna dance
(Do you...) Do you, do you, do you, do you wanna dance
(Do you...) Do you, do you, do you, do you, do you wanna dance
Do you wanna dance (Do you wanna dance)
Will you take a chance (Do you wanna dance)
Will hold my hand (Do you wanna dance)
At least let me be your lover man (Do you wanna dance)
Can I hold your hand (Do you wanna dance)
Let me be your lover man (Do you wanna dance)
Can I hold your hand (Do you wanna dance)
Oh baby
