Maybe I'm old fashioned feeling as I do
Maybe I'm living in the past
But when I meet the right girl I know that I'll be true
My first love will be my last
When I fall in love
It will be forever
Or I'll never fall in love
In a restless world like this is
Love is ended before it's begun
And too many moonlight kisses
Seem to cool in the warmth of the sun
When I give my heart
It will be completely
Or I'll never give my heart
And the moment I can feel that you feel that way too
Is when I fall in love with you
