Zawameki dake ga kokoro wo sashite
Kikoenai mune no toiki
Toki wo wasurete motome samayou
Takanaru omoi nurashite
Run away from reality I've been crying in the dream
Kôri tsuita toki ni furuete
Yugande mienai kioku kasaneru
Kanashimi ga kieru made
* You say anything kizutsuke au kotoba demo
Say anything tachikirenai kokoro ni
You say anything Just tell me all your sweet lies
Say anything enji kirenai kokoro ni
If I can go back to where I've been
Yume no naka ni dake ikite
Owaranai ame ni nureru
Nagareru namida wo hakujitsu yume ni somete
You say anything Whatever you like to say to me
Say anything You leave me out of my eyes
You say anything All I can hear is voice from dream
Say anything You can dry my every tear
Akari no kieta On the stage hitori mitsumete
Tôrisugita hibi ni dakareru
Kowashite kure nani mo ka mo kazatta ai mo
Toki no suna ni kieru made
*
Close your eyes
And I'll kill you in the rain
Kirei ni koroshi aeba
Zôka no bara ni umoreta
Shijin no namida wa kioku ni nagasarete
Time may change my life
But my heart remains the same to you
Time may change your heart
My love for you never changes
You say anything kizutsuke au kotoba demo
Say anything tachi kirenai kokoro ni
You say anything... Say anything
Now you've gone away
Where can I go from here?
Say anything... Say anything...
"I believed
If time passes, everything
Turns into beauty
If the rains stop, tears clean
The scars of memory away
Everything starts weaning fresh colors
Every sound begins playing
A heartfelt melody
Jealousy embelishes a page of the epic
Desire is embraced in a dream
But my mind is still in chaos and....."
