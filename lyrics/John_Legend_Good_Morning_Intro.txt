Good morning
Good morning love
It's my favorite love song
I waited all night long

Before you get into the shower
Before you worry about your hair
Baby give me one more hour
I want you to stay right there
I dont wanna lose a moment
I dont wanna miss a kiss
If i could plan the perfect day, love
Then i would start it just like this

Good morning
Good morning love
It's my favorite love song
I waited all night long
Good morning morning
Good morning love
Before we start the day dear
Im whispering in your ear
Good morning

Now baby how can i convince you
I'll make it so you can't resist
Whatever else you have to do now
It can't be half as good as this
I'll chase you underneath the sheets, love
And i won't let you get away
The day won't be complete, love
Unless we get a chance to say

Good morning
Good morning love
It's my favorite love song
I waited all night long
Good morning morning
Good morning love
Before we start the day dear
Im whispering in your ear
Good morning

Open your eyes
See my son rise
I feel you're skin
So warm inside
Day breaks so sweet
When you're next to me
So stay each night
So each morning will be

Before We Start The Day Dear
Im Whispering in your ear
Let's get lost together
I will smile forever
Was morning
