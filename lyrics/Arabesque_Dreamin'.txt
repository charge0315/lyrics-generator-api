Dreamin' is OK
Seems to take away
All your sorrow (sorrow)
Now you came to play
Leading you astray till tomorrow (tomorrow)
Just let yourself go
For a dream can be very exciting (exciting)
The sooner the know
If it's gonna be loving or fighting
Dreamin' on the other side of midnight
Till another day is dawning
Dreamin' on the other side of midnight
Till you wake up in the morning
Always and ever and ever
I dream about you
You say you love me forever
But never my dream will come true
Dreamin' is so supreme
It's the most kinky fancy (fancy)
Come along with me
Close you eyes and see
It's more chancy (chancy)
Just let yourself go
For a dream can be very exciting (exciting)
The sooner the know
If it's gonna be loving or fighting
Dreamin' on the other side of midnight
Till another day is dawning
Dreamin' on the other side of midnight
Till you wake up in the morning
Always and ever and ever
I dream about you
You say you love me forever
But never my dream will come true
Dreamin' on the other side of midnight
Till another day is dawning
Dreamin' on the other side of midnight
Till you wake up in the morning
Dreamin' on the other side of midnight
Till another day is dawning
Dreamin' on the other side of midnight
Till you wake up in the morning
