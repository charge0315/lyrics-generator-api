In this dime-a-dozen world
With you they must've broke the mold
Cause you're the only one I've met
That I would kill to call my own
Let it be known, I'm not aggressive nor possessive
All I know is, I would kill to make you mine
And I am usually not this bold
Let it be known, let it be known...
Let it be known, let it be known...

I never wanted to be anybody's anything and
I never wanted to be anybody's anything and
I never wanted to be anybody's anything and
I never wanted to be anybody's anything at all
Anybody's anything at all
Anybody's anything at all

I'm rather small and all my shortcomings stand tall
I've crawled upon my hands & knees
Out of the fear that I could fall
And through it all it's left me withered
Feeling bitter, bought and sold
Been told I'm not the nicest person
That you'll ever get to know
Let it be known, let it be known...
Let it be known, let it be known...

I never wanted to be anybody's anything and
I never wanted to be anybody's anything and
I never wanted to be anybody's anything and
I never wanted to be anybody's anything at all
Anybody's anything at all
Anybody's anything at all
No, anybody's anything at all
Anybody's anything at all

Weaving through this dust
I trust nobody else but us
I must admit it'd take some years
For me to walk without this crutch
So on and such, I'd still be fucked
If I am forced to walk alone
And should I crumble at your feet
I'll hold us both accountable
Let it be known, let it be known...
Let it be known, let it be known...

I never wanted to be anybody's anything and
I never wanted to be anybody's anything and
I never wanted to be anybody's anything and
I never wanted to be anybody's anything at all
Anybody's anything at all
Anybody's anything at all (at all)
Anybody's anything at all
No, anybody's anything at all
