Love is here
And, oh, my darling, now, you're gone
Love is here
And, oh, my darling, now, you're gone

You persuaded me to love you and I did
But instead of tenderness, I found heartache, instead
Into your arms, I fell, so unaware
Of the loneliness that was waiting there

You closed the door to your heart, girl
And you turned the key
Locked your love away from me

Love is here
And, oh, my darling, now, you're gone
You made me love you
And, oh, my darling, now, you're gone

You said loving you would make life beautiful
With each passing day
But as soon as love came into my heart
You turned and you walked, just walked away

You stripped me of my dreams
You gave me faith, then you took my hope
Look at me now

Look at me
See what lovin' you has done to me
Look at my face
See how crying has left its trace
After you made me all your own
Then you left me all alone
You made your words sound so sweet
Knowing that, your love, I couldn't keep

My heart cries out for your touch
But baby, you're not there
And the lonely cry fades in the air

Love is here
And, oh, my darling, now, you're gone
Love is here
And, oh, my darling, now, you're gone
You made me love you (Love, love is here)
Oh, oh, my darling, now, you're gone (And now, you're gone)
Talking 'bout love, love, love, love, ooh, ooh (Love, love is here)
My darling, now, you're gone (And now, you're gone)
Talking 'bout love, love, love, love, ooh, ooh (Love, love is here)
My darling, now, you're gone (And now, you're gone)
Talking 'bout love, love, love, love, ooh, ooh (Love, love is here)
My baby, now, you're gone (And now, you're gone)
