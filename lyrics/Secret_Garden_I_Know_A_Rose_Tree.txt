I know a Rose tree springing
Forth from an ancient root
As men of old we singing
From Jesse came the shoot
That bore a blossom bright
A-mid the cold of winter
When half spent was the night
O Flow'r, whose fragrance tender
With sweetness fills the air
Dispel in glorious splendor
The darkness ev'rywhere;
True man, yet very God
From sin and death now save us
And share our ev'ry load
