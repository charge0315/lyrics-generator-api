Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah

Some days I'll admit, I was difficult
Everything that you did, I was critical
You're holdin' the car keys, I'm sayin', "Don't tease me"
If you're leavin', just leave me

Baby, we were good, we were almost perfect
I'd say it's your fault, but you don't deserve it
You won't get back what we had with no one
Baby, we were good, it was almost worth it, we were almost

(Almost)
(Almost)

So real, sometimes, it was fictional, yeah
So good, sometimes, it was criminal
So happy without me, or are you just actin'?
Either way is right

Baby, we were good, we were almost perfect
I'd say it's your fault, but you don't deserve it
You won't get back what we had with no one
Baby, we were good, it was almost worth it, we were almost

(Almost)
(Almost)
Ah-ah-ah, almost (Almost)
Ah-ah-ah, almost

Baby, we were good, we were almost perfect
I'd say it's your fault, but you don't deserve it
You won't get back what we had with no one
Baby, we were good, it was almost worth it, we were almost (Ooh-ooh-ooh)

Ah-ah-ah, almost (Almost, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
Ah-ah-ah, almost (We were almost, almost, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
Ah-ah-ah, almost (Almost, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
Ah-ah-ah, almost (Almost)
