(One, two, three, four)
(Ah, yeah)
(Ah-ah-ah)
(Ah, I like that)
(Ah-ah-ah)
(Ah, yeah)

Sugar, honey, honey, sexy (Ah, I like that)
Sugar, honey, honey, sexy (Ah, yeah)

A limited sensation
To the feeling that you crave
One that means much more to you
Than to socialise stroke rave
The remedy is pure to me
Taking honey from the bee
You adopt this smooth sensation
Taking in deep meditation

Baby, sacrifice your stress
Then I'll help you melt your best
Trust it, baby, nice and slow
Trust me, baby, you're to know

The love groove
Has a different kind of move
The feeling of security
Tenderness, reality
The love groove
It flows from me to you
You're filling your best fantasies
Baby, set your mind on me

Sugar, honey, honey, sexy
Feel it, set your mind on me
Sugar, honey, honey, sexy
Feel it, set your mind on me
Sugar, honey, honey, sexy
Feel it, set your mind on me
Sugar, honey, honey, sexy
Feel it, set your mind on me

The portion that relies on pulse
Absorb it, baby, to your most
Oh, I'm sure you know the score
Just lay it honey, nice and cool
Come on, fix your dreams on me
Be the best that you can be
You adopt this new devotion
Giving in to pure emotion

Take it st-st-strip low
Baby, baby, baby, you know
Take it st-st-strip low
Trust me, baby, 'cos you know

The love groove
Has a different kind of move
The feeling of security
Tenderness, reality
The love groove
It flows from me to you
You're filling your best fantasies
Baby, set your mind on me

Yo, whaddup, shorty?
I've seen you move
Shaking your thing, you're looking real smooth
Slide my way, girl, you make it real hot
There's never a doubt
That I can hit the right spot
Each time we touch
I can tell it's more than just lust
Just take my hand and a little bit of trust
And when you're all alone
Thoughts of nothing but me

The love groove
Has a different kind of move
The feeling of security
Tenderness, reality
The love groove
It flows from me to you
You're filling your best fantasies
Baby, set your mind on me
The love groove
Has a different kind of move
The feeling of security
Tenderness, reality
The love groove
It flows from me to you
You're filling your best fantasies
Baby, set your mind on me

The love groove
The love groove
