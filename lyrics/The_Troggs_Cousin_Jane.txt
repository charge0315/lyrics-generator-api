Cousin Jane, cousin Jane
Come to stay again, come to stay again
Cousin Jane, cousin Jane
Come to stay again, come to stay again
Each night tip-toe across the landing
Kiss her lips just as she's standin' there
As she's standin' there
Cousin Jane, cousin Jane
Come to stay again, come to stay again
Cousin Jane, cousin Jane
Come to stay again, come to stay again
Each night hold her until the morning
See her take her place without yawnin' so
No one will ever know
Cousin Jane, cousin Jane
She's come to stay again, she's come to stay again
Cousin Jane, cousin Jane
She's come to stay again, she's come to stay again
Cousin Jane, cousin Jane
Cousin Jane, cousin Jane
