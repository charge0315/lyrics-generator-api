You're my thrill
You do something to me
You send chills right through me
When I look at you
I can't keep still
Cause you're my thrill
You're my thrill
How my pulse increases
I just go to pieces
When I look at you
Cause you're my thrill
Nothing seems to matter
Here's my heart on a silver platter
Where's my will
Why this strange desire
That keeps mounting higher
When I look at you
I can't keep still
Child I'm close to you
Lose my will
Standing next to you
Mmm lose my will
Nothing seems to matter
Here's my heart on a silver platter
Where's my will
Why this strange desire
That keeps mounting higher
When I'm close you
I can't keep still
Next to you
I lose my will
You're my thrill
You're my thrill
You're my thrill
