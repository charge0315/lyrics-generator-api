I want to be around to pick up the pieces
When somebody breaks your heart
Some somebody twice as smart as I

A somebody who will swear to be true
Like you used to do with me
Who'll leave you to learn
That misery loves company, wait and see

I mean, I want to be around to see how he does it (Woo)
When he breaks your heart to bits
Let's see if the puzzle fits so fine

And that's when I'll discover that revenge is sweet
As I sit there applauding from a front-row sеat
When somebody breaks your hеart like you broke mine

Then that's when we'll discover that revenge is sweet
As we sit there applauding from a front-row seat
When somebody breaks your heart like you broke mine
When somebody breaks your heart like you broke mine
Ah
