Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah

It seem to me that we don't always get along
If we are trying, now don't seem to try too long
Watching your neighbor seems to fill you with alarm
Just 'cause he's different now
Don't mean he means you harm
City living has got us all pent up inside
When we have problems, seems we all just run and hide
Time to discover why we are feeling this way
Let's let love have its say

I know you need it
Brother said he needs it, 1sister said she needs it
We're all gonna need it someday
We seem to lose our way, somehow got led astray
That's why I'm here to say, gotta get back, get back to love
I know you need it
Brother said he needs it, sister said she needs it
We're all gonna need it someday
We seem to lose our way, somehow got led astray
That's why I'm here to say, gotta get back to it now

Trouble started when we don't communicate
We'll build our future now or we can seal our fate
Wasted energy on promises we break
We've wasted chance now, but still it ain't too late
There is a common goal we must all realize
It's time to make a change in how we live our lives
Time to discover why we are feeling this way
Let's let love save the day

I know you need it
Brother said he needs it, sister said she needs it
We're all gonna need it someday
We seem to lose our way, somehow got led astray
That's why I'm here to say, gotta get back to it now
I know you need it
Brother said he needs it, sister said she needs it
We're all gonna need it someday
We seem to lose our way, somehow got led astray
That's why I'm here to say, gotta get back, get back to love
I know you need it
Brother said he needs it, sister said she needs it
We're all gonna need it someday
We seem to lose our way, somehow got led astray
That's why I'm here to say, gotta get back to it now

I know you need it
Brother said he needs it, sister said she needs it
We're all gonna need it someday
We seem to lose our way, somehow got led astray
That's why I'm here to say, gotta get back, get back to love
I know you need it
Brother said he needs it, sister said she needs it
We're all gonna need it someday
We seem to lose our way, somehow got led astray
