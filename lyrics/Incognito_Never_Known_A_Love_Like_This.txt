Stay with me a while, let’s take a little time
I want to let you know what I feel inside
Now that we can choose where we go from here, it’s alright
Yesterday has gone, we learnt to let it go
Now we know that life will never be the same
Tomorrow we’ll rise to see the perfect light, it’s alright
I can feel it in my head, I can feel if in my heart
Every little thing you do let’s me know its true
Never known a love like this
I guess that it was meant to be
We never planned it, somehow we found it
Never known a love like this
It’s taken such a hold of me
I just got lucky, so glad I found you
Never known a love like this
Come and flow with me, to a love supreme
We found a paradise that is deep and true
We can blow as leaves tended by the wind, it’s alright
We can find a way through the Joy and pain
There’s no darkened sky we can’t rise above
See the brightest sun that ever has shone
It’s alright
I can see it in your eyes, yes I feel it in your touch
Everything you do let’s me know its true
Never known a love like this
I guess that it was meant to be
We never planned it, somehow we found it
Never known a love like this
It’s taken such a hold of me
I just got lucky, so glad I found you
Never known a love like this
