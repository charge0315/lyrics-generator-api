La-la-la, la-la-la, la, ooh, oh

From the very first time back when I met you at school
I looked in your eyes, saw something special in you
We aspire that we will be American dream
Escape this reality, come start a new one with me

We could be neighborhood royalty
Or much more than that you'll see, we're makin' history
We'll go to the mass, fly to heaven and back
The highest heights we'll match, yes, as we can do all of that, baby

La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la
We could be king and queen someday
La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la
We'll never throw our dreams away

We'll make this picture complete, start a new family
A boy that looks just like you, a girl that looks just like me
And each day that they grow, we'll teach them all that we know
Help me show them the way

We'll show them we're not afraid to be free
The only limit should be
The flyest fantasies, the highest they can dream
Grab hold to my hand, say that you'll be my man
Someday you'll be my king, and baby, I'm your queen to be

La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la
We could be king and queen someday (Someday)
La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la (La-la, la-la-la)
We'll never throw our dreams away

Cities may crumble, the world is in trouble
But we'll be in love and we'll rise above it
Each of our people, pray for a leader
I know we will be someday, someday, oh
Someday, someday, someday, oh, someday

La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la (La-la-la-la)
We'll never throw our dreams away
La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la (La-la-la-la-la-la)
We could be king and queen someday (Someday)
La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la (Oh)
We'll never throw our dreams away
