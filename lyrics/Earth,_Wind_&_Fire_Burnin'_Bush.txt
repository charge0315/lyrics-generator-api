What does it take to show an illustration
Of the hurt and the pain of a nation?
One glowing look upon a ragged canvas
Tells the story of our past and our present situation
That old bush just keeps on burning
Shares the hope of future learning
Nobody seems to show they're learning
That old bush just keeps on burning
And I wonder will we ever feel the flame?
This way of life on total exhibition
Shows the way in which we live of an impatient nation
This tree of life, so far from perfection
Share a little love to improve our situation
That old bush just keeps on burning
Nobody seems to show they're learning
Flow of light could really stand a listen
Bring the dark to the light
Show what we've been missing
Not many men are satisfied
Without no light, there ain't no pride
Gonna shout it from the mountaintop this evenin'
I wonder, will it ever be the same?
Yeah I wonder, will we ever, feel the flame? (Alright)
Will we ever feel the flame?
There's gonna come a time
Things that's on your mind
Judgement you will find
Planted right in your mind
True love is here to find
Simple as the number 9
Multiply you will find
Peace and love all the time
Peace and love all the time
Peace and love all the time
Peace and love all the time
