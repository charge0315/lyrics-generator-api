Hey baby
Yeah?
Don't you think it's bout time we got things straight?
With my old man and your old lady?
Yeah. Cause we're goin to get caught
But we're in love
We gotta be fair to ourselves and everyone else concerned

I know it's wrong
But we've been doing this so long
That we just can't stop it now
But if we try
To be careful it's alright
If you stay with me tonight
I wanna keep holdin' on, holdin' on, holdin' on
When I know that you got some place to go
I wanna keep holdin' on, holdin' on, holdin' on
When it seems that it could never be
Now me and you
We got someone to answer to
And we both know that it's true
So why should we
Try to hid it now, you'll see
It's the best thing that could be
I wanna keep holdin' on, holdin' on, holdin' on
When I know that you got some place to go
I wanna keep holdin' on, holdin' on, holdin' on
When it seems it could never be, oh yeah
So why should we
Try to hid it now, you'll see
It's the best thing that could be
Oh, I wanna keep holdin' on, holdin' on, holdin' on
When I know that you got some place to go
I said, I wanna keep holdin' on, holdin' on, holdin' on
When it seems that it could never be
