There may be trouble ahead
But while there's moonlight and music and love and romance
Let's face the music and dance

Before the fiddlers have fled
Before they ask us to pay the bill
And while we still have the chance
Let's face the music and dance

Soon we'll be without the moon
Hummin' a different tune
And then

There may be teardrops to shed
So while there's moonlight and music and love and romance
Let's face the music and dance

Take it
Come on

Soon we'll be without the moon
Hummin' a different tune
And then, and then

There maybe teardrops to shed
But while there's moonlight and music and love and romance
Let's face the music and dance, dance
Let's face the music and dance
