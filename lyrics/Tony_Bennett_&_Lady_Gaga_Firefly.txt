I call her Firefly
'Cause, oh my, she radiates moon glow
Wants none of that noon glow
She starts to glitter when the sun goes down, bout eight p.m
It's mayhem
She switches the brights up
Lights up and gives me a call
"Take me to the Fireflies ball"

But when I get her there, set her there, do I get to pet her there, grab me some glow?
No, she's a gad about, mad about, luring every lad about
While leaving me moaning low

Oh, Firefly
Why can't I latch onto you no how?
Oh, how I love you but gee
While you set the night on firefly
Shine a little light on me

He calls me Firefly
'Cause, oh my, I radiate moon glow
Want none of that noon glow
Start to glitter when the sun goes down, bout eight p.m
It's mayhem
I'm switching those brights up
Light up, give a call
"Take me to the Firefly ball"

But when I get her there, I set her there, and do I get to pet her there, and grab me some glow?
Well she's a girl about, I'm mad about luring every lad about
While leaving me moaning low

Oh, Firefly, why can't I latch on for you no how
Oh, how I love you but gee
While you set the night on firefly
Shine a little light on
Shine a little light on
Shine a little light on me, on me
In the mornin'
