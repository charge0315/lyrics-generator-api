Sam, you were there for me
When I was weak
I couldn’t speak
And I don’t know
Why I’m always running to you
Sam, tell me who I am
Do you understand what’s happening?
Oh, Sam, will you hold my hand tonight?
Sam, you defended me
From all the people in the street
That don’t understand
I wonder if we’ll ever cross that bridge again
Will you hold my hand tonight?
Sometimes I feel deserted by love
Have I lost my faith that love will ever bring somebody home?
‘Til then
Will you hold my hand tonight?
And I don’t know why
I am always running to you
Sam, will you hold my hand?
Sometimes I feel deserted by love
Have I lost all faith that love will ever bring somebody home?
‘Til then
Will you hold my hand tonight?
Will you hold my hand tonight?
