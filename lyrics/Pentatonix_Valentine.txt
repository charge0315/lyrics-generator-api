(Oh, will you be mine?)
Dear friend of mine
(Please don't be so terrified)
(I'm okay to be)
Terrified
Please don't be so shy (Please don't be so shy)

So will you never be my lover or my valentine
Never be a friend of mine
Never see my better side?
Maybe you'd be terrified
Of all the secrets you were wishing you won't ever find
'Cause deep inside me
And I don't wanna hide me

'Cause I know about my love
'Cause I know about my love
'Cause I know about my love
'Cause I know about my love

Yeah, pick it fast like a flight far away from here (Fly away)
Before I know I feel at home whenever you are near
Live my life, you better cold cut to this
I wish you'd hold me open just to see your vision clear

'Cause I know about my love ('Cause I know about my love)
'Cause I know about my love ('Cause I know about my love)
'Cause I know about my love ('Cause I know about my love)
'Cause I know about my love ('Cause I know about my love)

'Cause I know about my love
'Cause I know about my love
About my love
About my love
About my love

(Oh, will you be mine?)
(Please don't be so terrified)
It's okay to be terrified
Please don't be so shy (Please don't be so shy)
