GOING ROUND ONE MORE TIME (2:50)
(Livingston Taylor)
My heart had been broken
I could not stand no more
I put locks on my windows
And I bolted tight my door
Then I took a look at you
And could not control my mind

Now I’m going round, going round
Going round, going around
One more time
I'll be going round, going round
Going round, going around
One more time
Betty was a little heartbreaker
Oh it didn’t quite work out
It did a number on my confidence
I was riddled with self-doubt
I said that’s it, I’m through, I quit
But then Juanita she looked so fine

Round and around in a circle
It’s always the same
One moment you swear you've had enough
And the next you've got to know her name
Well, awhile by myself, it wasn’t that bad
I was getting by as I could get
I stepped into a drugstore
For one pack of cigarettes
She didn’t have a coin
She had to call her cousin Kate
And could I maybe loan her
Just one dime
