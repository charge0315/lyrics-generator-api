Girl, tell me what did I do wrong
To make you go away
I'm just about to lose my mind
Can you find the time to come home
My mind keeps playing tricks on me
You're the face on every street
You've got me doing crazy things
Hearing phones that don't never ring
You've got me talking to myself
Since you put me down
You got me walking by myself
Walking by myself
Since you're not at home
I've never made a big mistake
But I finally paid the price
You've left me full of memories
That won't ever leave while you're gone
Just let me make it up to you
It's not too late to try
Don't leave me here with empty dreams
And I hope I meet you at home
You've got me talking to myself
Since you put me down
You got me walking by myself
Walking by myself
Since you're not at home
You've got me talking to myself
Since you put me down
Just look in my eyes, I'm so lonely
You got me walking by myself
Since you're not at home
You've got me talking to myself
Since you put me down
Just look in my eyes, I'm so lonely
You got me walking by myself
Since you're not at home
