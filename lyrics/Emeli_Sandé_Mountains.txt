He said I'm going to have a bed with lots of pillows
And that we’re going to build a house with lots of windows
And when we have the kids, we’ll tell them to remind we
Of where we were now, so we never get lazy

Yeah we’ll climb mountains, climb mountains together
Yeah we’ll climb mountains, climb mountains together

I’d never work these hours if I didn't love you
My hands are always red and sunshine I sleep through
If you say we’re gonna move somewhere with neighbours less crazy
You know I'm going to be there, 'cause I trust my baby

Yeah we’ll climb mountains, climb mountains together
Yeah we’ll climb mountains, climb mountains together

I keep my fingers crossed that we’re going to be able
I touch the wood for luck on our broken table
I know that it’s our heart that’s going to save us
If we never come back, how can they blame us?

Yeah we’ll climb mountains, climb mountains together
Yeah we’ll climb mountains, climb mountains together
Yeah we’ll climb mountains, climb mountains together
Yeah we’ll climb mountains, climb mountains together
