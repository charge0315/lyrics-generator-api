Every day's a special day
Touched in every special way
Only by you love
Some have birthday's once a year
But my celebration's always here
Because you're near
You are my holiday
Oh yeah holiday
Yes, you're my holiday
Saturdays, ooh, fun days forever
Ooh, ooh (forever)
(Holidays) this is peaceful life I wanna share
(Holidays) all over the world
Seems I'm all by myself
It's lastin' all day long
I stay hot all over
By, by seasons such a frame
Went from  your to blame
Ooh, and I can't stop cumming
You are my holiday
Yes, my only holiday
Woo, a holiday
Saturdays, ooh
Fun days forever day in my life (forever)
(You are my holiday) you are my holiday
My oh yeah holiday
Hey
 fun day
Can't help it
'Cause it's so much fun forever
And ever, and ever
You got a holiday in your lips, ooh
(Holiday) a holiday in your hips
You've got a holiday in your lips
Just my way
Ooh, holidays is every day
(Holiday) oh, thank you, baby, (thank you, baby)
(Holiday) bringing it just my way, oh yeah, ooh
Thank you baby (thank you baby)
Oh, oh, thank you, baby, baby (thank you, baby), ooh
(Holiday) thank you, baby, it's holiday, holiday
Thank you, baby...
