Take a seat and cool it 'cause unless you overrule it
We are ready to show you some blowin'
A rompin' and a stompin' is a lot of fun
Four brothers who are blowin' our horns
So settle down an' listen 'cause you don't know what you're missin'
And we're ready to give you a showin'
A movin' it 'n groovin' it has just begun
Four brothers who are blowin' our horns
We got a little message that you're gonna enjoy
Ain't no sense in dodgin' the facts
So settle in your easy chair an' if you ever had a care - forget it
It's time to relax
You might as well admit it, we're the best that ever did it
But in case you ain't too sure o' knowin'
We're gonna let you listen to us one by one
Four brothers who are blowin' our horns
How'd ya do, I'm talkin' about you
It's very nice to know that you have really taken time to listen to me blow
'Cause as sure as I'm born, I'm blowin' my horn
Listen't'me baby, I'm blowin', zootin' it up
And I hope you dig the sounds I'm makin' more'n any other
Now I must go for it's time for you to listen to my other brother
I think the chick's talkin' 'bout me so I'd better go 'n see
I'm hip that she knows a horn is very best to greet you
That's the reason I'm blowin' so snappily
I don't know what ya got, but it thrills me an' I hope to have a lot
'Cause it puts me in clover
So baby, if you would like to dig my other brother
You're gonna have to turn the record over
Hey hey hey
Who ya talkin' about, say who ya talkin' about
Did I hear you say you'd introduce your other brother
'Cause in case I heard you talkin' about three, that's me
Pleased to meet you, how'd you do, how are you, nothin's new
How is everything with you?
Whattya say I leave this jazz up to my brother --
Dig dig dig my Long Island sound
I hope you're puttin' it down
You got me in a mood that's so romantic
If you noticed you can take this silly old actin'
'Cause I'm actin' so distracted when I dig you
Pretty baby you will never know how much I really dig you
You have got me so excited that I goofed blowin' my horn
Boop bop the news is gettin' around, we're really puttin' it down
We're glad, in fact, to know that you enjoy it and we wish we had the time to give you more
Thank you for the compliment
You told us we were better just as though we didn't know it
We're hip that we're the best, we're over all the rest
We're in the modern school, we always play it cool, we never play the fool
The honkers and the squeakers might be stealin' the show
But we don't go for that, so while we blow
Hi-ho, lackaday, boy it's a natural fact
I ain't no kin, but I would like to get in the act!
Well get outta here, get outta here, get outta here now
Fellas we appreciate it makin' you mad
But we must ask you to apologize
Because after all he's in our band
Four brothers, four brothers, four brothers
Although we sound like more
Four brothers, four brothers, four brothers
We're really only four
We like to blow but we don't know how time can fly and how an hour can pass away
We wish the time would never go so we could take our time an' blow 'til judgement day
Four brothers, four brothers, four brothers
Now just one final word:
I'm happy to know you and I hope I don't forget you
It's really a pleasure and I hope I don't look silly to you
I'm hopin' the story that I told did not upset you
Sorry, now in conclusion we are hoping that you heard four
So just before we go we want you to know ---
We're glad you let us show you how we always end up with that jazz
(We don't go for braggin' but we're blowin' our own...)
Horn!
