Sweeter than a good night's sleep
After a hard days work
Sweeter than a mother's smile
When she first sees her child
Sweeter than the kindest words
Spoke to a total stranger
Tenderness is a touch
No, more a gentle clutch
But nothing's sweeter
Nothing's sweeter
Nothing's sweeter
Sweeter than my baby's love

Stronger than the tides that bind
The ocean to the earth
 in the distance
Throughout the universe
Yes, she's all I need
For coffee and my tea
Look what she does to me
Well, it's oh so sweet
See, nothing's sweeter, sweeter
Nothing's sweeter
Nothing's sweeter
Sweeter than my baby's love

Nothing's sweeter than my baby's love
Nothing's sweeter than my baby's love
Nothing's sweeter than my baby's love
