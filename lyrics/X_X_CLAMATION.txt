Reflection in the blade tightly held by shaking hands
A pounding in his head, a ***** drenched in hot piss
Face beaten bloody red, angels crept into her head
A storm comes down, the knot tightens up inside his chest
She can’t speak when she’s dead
Lamb left rotting in the shed
Planted like a seed, rusty metal soaks into her head
Bloodlust spilled out to silence the hoards of regret
Entrails spill out, watering the flowеrbed
Will u stay the night? keep my corpse to hеr closer~
Light dies in my eyes, decor bruises all over
Swallowed by holy fire, smell cremated roses?
Vomit in the blood, tears dry when they're smoldered
Her neck stitched tight, but it always comes unsewn
Pale flesh flashing lights, a cadaver left alone
It just doesn’t seem right, love her even when she’s bones
I want to keep her whole so i carry her home
Red tinted film to keep her remembered
A photo in a locket for the trophy of December
Traumas written on her wrist, she’s choking on a crucifix
Blooming when the razors in, pink roses as she gasps for breath
The ghost of the fawn dancing away in the wind
Innocence set ablaze after escaping prison flesh
The lost girl’s shell lying cold in the morgue
An article, a photograph to sell her to a store
Hammer smashed face, pretty flesh upon my plate
Scraping skin away, ‘til i distintegrate
My heart rotting bad, bruised black to match the ache
Doll parts shattered to pieces, the suffering fades
Oh, yes yes come see what they did
Got her in six pieces, laid out in the shed
Stomach pulling roses, dripping ***** from her chin
Will it satisfy the hunger of a flesh-starved audience?
