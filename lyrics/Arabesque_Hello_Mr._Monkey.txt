Hello, hello Mister Monkey
You're still so fast and funky
Hello, hello Mister Monkey
You should have been a clown
Hello, hello Mister Monkey
You're still so fast and funky
Hello, hello Mister Monkey
You should have been a clown
Once he was so famous, that little old clown
Everybody used to know his name
Now he's a nameless but happy old guy
The children laugh if only he walks by
Hello, hello Mister Monkey
You're still so fast and funky
Hello, hello Mister Monkey
You should have been a clown
Hello, hello Mister Monkey
You're still so fast and funky
Hello, hello Mister Monkey
You should have been a clown
When the sun is shining he goes to the park
Climbs the empty bandstand on the green
Doing for the children his famous routine
So they still laugh when slowly he walks home
Hello, hello Mister Monkey
You're still so fast and funky
Hello, hello Mister Monkey
You should have been a clown
Hello, hello Mister Monkey
You're still so fast and funky
Hello, hello Mister Monkey
You should have been a clown
