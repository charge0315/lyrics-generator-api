Little lemon why so red?
The flowers in the garden said "you've got no family. You've can't even read"
1,2,3,4,5 you're late the rabbit at the garden gate said
Little lemon why so red?
The flowers in the garden said "you've got no family. You've can't even read"
1,2,3,4,5 you're late the rabbit at the garden gate said
"lemon you're blind, look at the time"
The wind set the flowers dancing with a rumour of sunlight
Its good to see you in the morning X2
It's good to see now X2
Its good to see you in the morning X2
Its good to see now X2
Put the stalks into your pocket
Keep the petals in your locket
Save them till when its winter again
Little lemon why so red the flowers in the garden said
"We all get along now come sing our song"
The wind set the flowers dancing with a rumour of sunlight
Its good to see you in the morning X2
Its good to see now X2
