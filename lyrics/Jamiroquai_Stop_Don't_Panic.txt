My head's under pressure, baby, life's the same
It's like a suicidal incubator, cooking my brain
There must be a subsonic infiltrator, making the strain
See, I'm a high-pressure operator, any cat's the same

(Stop, don't panic) It's just a thing I do
(It's not so tragic) Nothing to hang on to
(Ooh, ah, ooh, yeah, ooh, ah, ooh, yeah)
There's just nothing to hang on to

I'm like a tiger in a cage, so set me free
How do I stop this crazy rage, from eating me?
I'm not so cool about my own route, as I used to be
I'm gonna hit my switch and fly through the canopy

(Stop, don't panic) It's just a thing I do
(It's not so tragic) Nothing to hang on to
(Stop, don't panic) It's just a thing I do
(It's not so tragic) Nothing to hang on to

(Ooh, ah, ooh, yeah, ooh, ah, ooh, yeah)
(Ooh, ah, ooh, yeah, ooh, ah, ooh, yeah)
(Ooh, ah, ooh, yeah, ooh, ah, ooh, yeah)
(Ooh, ah, ooh, yeah, ooh, ah, ooh, yeah)

It's just a thing I do
Nothing to hang on to, oh
(Stop) It's just a thing I do, nothing to hang on to
It's just a thing I do, nothing to hang on to
