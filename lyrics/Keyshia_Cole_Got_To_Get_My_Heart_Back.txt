I know where I went wrong when I loved you more then I loved myself
I would have done anything for you (Aye, aye, aye, aye)
And I learned when I realized you didn't love me the way that I loved you, but now I know
It's hurts inside (Aye, aye, aye, aye)
Aye, aye, aye

Gotta get my heart back to the way it used to love
The way it used to be
And the way it used to feel
Before I fell in love
Fell in love with you
Gotta get my heart back to the way it used to love
The way it used to be
And the way it used to feel
Before I fell in love
Fell in love with you

All I want is true love
Couldn't tolerate no more loving someone
Who couldn't learn to love somebody else
That's why my heart ain't been the same, aye, aye
I see right now where it's headin' down
The same road I've seen before
But no one told me that it would hurt this way
And my life wouldn't be the same
That's why I got to get my heart back to

Gotta get my heart back to the way it used to love
The way it used to be
And the way it used to feel
Before I fell in love
Fell in love with you

You ain't gotta lie (Lie)
You see me lookin fly (Fly)
You want me on your arm (Arm)
Well I ain't got the time (Time)
I've seen it all baby
I've been around the world
And it's a cold game everywhere around the world
I've seen niggas get crossed up cause they the realist
And all the realist niggas in the
Streets ain't got no feelings
It comes from being neglected and I'm so alone
I'm in my own zone, tryna get my heart back

Gotta get my heart back to the way it used to love
The way it used to be
And the way it used to feel
Before I fell in love (Fell)
Fell in love with you (I'm tryna get my heart)
Gotta get my heart back to the way it used to love
(Hey, yeah, come on how)
The way it used to be (How it used to be)
And the way it used to feel
Before I fell in love
Fell in love with you

The way I used to love, baby
The way I used to be, baby
The way I used to feel, baby
Before I fell in love, baby
Fell in love, fell in love with you
The way I used to love, baby
The way I used to be, baby
The way I used to feel, baby
Before I fell in love, baby
Fell in love, fell in love with you
