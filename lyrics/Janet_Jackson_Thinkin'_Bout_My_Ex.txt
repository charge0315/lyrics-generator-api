When I first met you
I swear that I was straight with you
I wasn't lookin' for nobody new
I just needed someone to talk to
You said you were cool and understood
But now you caught feelings like I knew you would
And you sittin' there with a broken heart
'Cause I gave you my body (Body) and not my heart

When I'm holding you late at night
I'm thinkin' 'bout my ex
When I'm kissing you and look at you
I'm thinkin' 'bout my ex
And I'm sorry, I didn't mean to hurt you
And I know sorry doesn't mend your broken heart

Baby, I have to be unselfish and true to me
'Cause I'm not where I really wanna be
And it's nothin' with you, it's all me (It's all me)
I toss and turn all night when I sleep (Oh)
Wantin' and reachin' for someone who used to be (Oh)
I said it must be some kinda karma thing
'Cause I can't seem to let go (Let go), love again

And when I lay with you, I close my eyes
I'm thinkin' 'bout my ex
When I'm touchin' you gently
I'm thinkin' 'bout my ex
And I'm sorry (Sorry), I didn't mean to hurt you
And I know sorry doesn't mend your broken heart
When I'm listenin' to music
I'm thinkin' 'bout my ex
In a bubble bath, with the candles lit
I'm thinkin' 'bout my ex
And I'm sorry (Sorry), I didn't mean to hurt you
And I know sorry doesn't mend your broken heart

(You're beautiful) I don't wanna take the space from someone else
(So let me go) And do a little soul searchin' for myself
(I'm sorry that) I pulled you in and let it get this far
You know I never meant to break your heart

At the shopping mall (Shopping mall) or movies (Movies)
I'm thinkin' 'bout my ex
At the restaurant (Restaurant) while I'm eating (Eating)
I'm thinkin' 'bout my ex
And I'm sorry (Sorry), I didn't mean to hurt you
And I know sorry doesn't mend your broken heart
(I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry)
While you talk to me (Talk to me), I drift away (Drift away)
I'm thinkin' 'bout my ex
When you ask me (Ask me) what I'm thinkin' (Thinkin')
I'm thinkin' 'bout my ex
And I'm sorry (Sorry) I didn't mean (Didn't mean) to hurt you
And I know sorry doesn't mend your broken heart
(I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry)
At the shopping mall (Shopping mall) or movies (Movies)
I'm thinkin' 'bout my ex
(I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry)
At the restaurant  (Restaurant) while I'm eating (Eating)
I'm thinkin' 'bout my ex
(I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry)
And I'm sorry (Sorry), I didn't mean to hurt you
And I know sorry doesn't mend your broken heart

You know, it's not what you think it is
Pull over
Let me do all the work
