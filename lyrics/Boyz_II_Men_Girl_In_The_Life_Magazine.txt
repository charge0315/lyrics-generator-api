I fell in love with the girl in the picture
That I used to keep
Carried her 'round in the back of my pocket
She was always with me
I imagined that I was a man of importance
And she had a fancy for me

And I used to dream she would call, crying her eyes out
She had an obsession with me
I was the love of her life and she was all mine
The girl in the Life magazine

The first time we met in an aisle at the market
She was staring at me
I knew even then we would share something special
And it was like chemistry
I fell in love from the moment I saw her
So I took her straight home with me

And that's where I'd dream she would step right out of the picture
And spend the whole evening with me
And, oh, how she hated to go back to her picture
The girl in the Life magazine

All of my friends used to laugh (All of my friends used to laugh)
Said I was certifiably mad (Said I was mad)
'Til the day that she came and she blew them away
And asked me if I'd be her man

It seems that she went and fell in love with my letters
She said she's been looking for me
And so the story ends well, we end up together
The girl in the Life magazine
Me and the girl in the Life magazine
