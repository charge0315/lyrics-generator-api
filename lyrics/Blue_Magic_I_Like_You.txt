I like the way you say my name!
I like the look that's on your face!
I like the winding, twining mix-up in your hair!
I like the feeling that you care!
And the moment you do, be waiting for you
I hope that you do!
Please remember the day, that I said
I like you!
Sure like you, sure like you
I like you!
Sure like you...
I... sure like you
I like the way you say hello
I think you know that I'm too boast
I like the moonlight madness, mystery in your stares
I like it!
And I like the feeling that you care
And the moment that you do!
I'd waiting for you!
And I hope that you do?
Please remember the day, that I said
Hey babe!
Sure do like you!
Sure like you!
Please remember the day, that I said
Hey babe!
Sure do like you!
Sure like you
Just remember the day that I said!
I like you
