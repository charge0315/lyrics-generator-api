There's a man, runnin' hot
And there's a night train
I know he's gonna stick it out
Ride that crazy white horse
He's a man, he's a pig in paradise
But he might get blown into the weeds tonight

Seems like there's a record stuck
And man, I couldn't make it up
He's a cool-hand Luke
He's a duke on a slippery slope
He's dispossessed and crazy
Thank you for nothin', baby
All those dreams are goin' up in smoke

I said hey, Floyd, you got your mind in a mess again
Hey, Floyd, you got to learn how to break the chain

Oh, yeah
There's a night train to your heartbreak, get on
It's the big time that's been drivin' you on
No more blue skies hanging over your head
So whatcha gonna do Floyd? (Do, Floyd...)
I've got to know
Got to know what you're going to do, yeah
Whatcha gonna do, whatcha gonna do?
Whatcha gonna do, Floyd? (Do, Floyd...)
I got to know
I've got to know what you're going to do
There's a night train to your heartbreak, get on
It's the big time that's been drivin' you on and on
No more blue sky hanging over your head
No more blue skies hanging over you, ooh...

Come on, Floyd
Shoot 'em up and shoot 'em down
Cut down that spot of freedom
Kick it, stick it, doin' what you can
Gotta make the pieces fit
Get rid of all that shit
Floyd, you can't forget, you're a man

I said hey, Floyd, you got your mind in a mess again
Hey, Floyd, you got the time on your hands to mend

Come on, Floyd
Gotta learn to break that chain now, baby
Hey, Floyd
Gotta learn to break that chain now, baby

Get off that shotgun ride
I know how much you tried
To blow the high priestess of pain away
You're a lone extravaganza
A dirty player and a dirty dancer
Hell, man, you don't even know your name

Hey, Floyd, you got your mind in a mess again
(You got your mind in a mess again)
Hey, Floyd, you got to learn how to break the chain
(Dirty player, dirty dancer)
Come on, Floyd, that's all I ask of you
(Dirty player, dirty dancer)
(Dirty player, dirty dancer)
Come on, Floyd, that's all I ask of you
Hey Floyd, don't get your mind in a mess again...
