We are Children of Paradise
When the Lord created us
All his work was through
Then the Children of Paradise
Did the only thing
They really shouldn't do
Children of Paradise
We started out there
Full of innocence in our eyes
And without a care
We're Children of Paradise
We knew of no crime
Until one of the meanest lines
Has changed our time
It was long ago
In the early morning glow
When it all began
With Adam and Eve
They were young and free
And for all eternity
They were meant to feel
No trouble, no grief
Children of Paradise
We started out there
Full of innocence in our eyes
And without a care
We're Children of Paradise
In search of the light
That was put out in Paradise
And started the night
It was long ago
In the early morning glow
When it all began
With Adam and Eve
They were young and free
And for all eternity
They were meant to feel
No trouble, no grief
We are Children of Paradise
When the Lord created us
All his work was through
Then the Children of Paradise
Did the only thing
They really shouldn't do
Aaahhh...
Aaahhh...
Aaahhh...
Aaahhh...
We're Children of Paradise
Who didn't obey
When we followed the wrong advice
We wandered astray
We're Children of Paradise
In search of the light
That was put out in Paradise
And started the night
It was long ago
In the early morning glow
When it all began
With Adam and Eve
They were young and free
And for all eternity...
