Love, love, love
Why'd you take so long to come to me? Oh, baby
And love, love, your love
Tell me, were you hiding from me all the time?
Each time I try to find someone to take your place
It was all in vain
No, their lips were never quite the same, no, baby
When I was kissing someone new, deep inside I was missing you

Ah baby, you made me fall in love with you
Now I don't know just what I'm gonna do
Ah honey, I looked out into empty space
And all I saw was your sweet face

Love, love, love
You can't imagine what you do to me, oh baby
And love, your love, every time you smile, it goes through me all the time
Day by day I'm fallin' more in love with you, and that's no lie
Cross my heart and honey I hope to die
'Cause I'm not tryin' to mislead you
Believe me, girl, I really need you

Oh, oh baby, you made me fall in love with you
Now I don't know just what I'm gonna do
Oh honey, I looked out into empty space
And all I saw was your sweet face
Ah baby, you made me fall in love with you
Now I don't know just what I'm gonna do
Ah honey, I looked out into empty space
All I saw was your sweet face

Love, love, love
Love, love, love
