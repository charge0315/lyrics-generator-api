Yeah

Baby, I believe in you
And every little thing you do
Every time we kiss
It always feels like this
I believe in you

Baby, I believe in us
And every little inch of our trust
Whether I’m around
You never let me down
I believe in you

Maybe I might sound crazy
For the way I feel about you
But baby, you’re just so amazing
And I’m so in love, girl, with you

I believe in you

Maybe I might sound crazy
For the way I feel about you
But baby, you’re just so amazing
And I’m so in love, girl, with you

Oh girl, there’s somethin’ about you

Maybe I might sound crazy
For the way I feel about you
But baby, you’re just so amazing
And I’m so in love, girl, with you

I believe in you
I believe in you, yeah
All the things you do (I believe in you)
Makes me believe in you, baby
I believe in you (I believe you)
Hope that you believe in me
Oh baby (I believe in you)
