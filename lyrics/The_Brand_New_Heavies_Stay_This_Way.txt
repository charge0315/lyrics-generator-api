Living with you in my life
Is like feeling the whole world's on my side
Putting a smile in the place
Where a tear used to run down my face
Feeling the sun on my head
Where a cloud used to follow instead
Singing a song in my heart
In a place where all my troubles depart
If our dreams fall back on the ground
Then we'll make them fly
Let the rain keep falling on down
'Cause baby I'm high
I think we'll fly
Now that we're together
Love is so high
Stay this way forever
With you in my life
Is like feeling the whole world's on my side
Putting a smile in the place
That a tear used to run down my face
If our dreams fall back on the ground
Then we'll make them fly
Let the rain keep falling on down
'Cause baby I'm high, high
Yeah, I think we'll fly
Now that we're together, oh yeah
Love is so high
Stay this way forever, oh yeah
Whoa-oh

Our love, yeah, yeah
Love will be here forever
I know that we'll stay together
Our love will be here forever
I hope that we'll stay together
Love will be here forever
I know that we'll stay together
Our love will be here forever
I hope that we'll stay together
Love will be here forever
I know that we'll stay together
Our love will be here forever
I hope that we'll stay together
Love will be here forever
I know that we'll stay together
Our love will be here forever
I hope that we'll stay together
Love will be here forever
I know that we'll stay together
Our love will be here forever
I hope that we'll stay together
Love will be here forever
I know that we'll stay together
Our love will be here forever
I hope that we'll stay together
Love will be here forever
I know that we'll stay together
Our love will be here forever
I hope that we'll stay together
Love will be here forever
I know that we'll stay together
Our love will be here forever
I hope that we'll stay together
Our love will be forever
If we stay together
