Never stop, never giving up
Never stop, never giving up
Never stop, never giving up
Never stop, never giving up
Never stop, never giving up
Never stop, never giving up

Give it up, feels so good to be together
Spending some time, making love
Making plans to last forever
Staying true until the end

True, there ain't a minute in the day that's without you
Hoping that you feel and do what you want
What you're feeling I am feeling, too
Never stop, never giving up

Never stop, never giving up
Never stop, never giving up
Never stop, never giving up

Evergreen, growing up but fading never
This is what our love became, free at last
Free from all the pain and sorrow
Never feel the hurt again

True, there ain't a minute in the day that's without you
Hoping that you feel and do what you want
What you're feeling I am feeling, too
Never stop, never giving up
True, there ain't a minute in the day that's without you
And I'm hoping that you feel and do what you want
What you're feeling I am feeling, too
Never stop, never giving up

Take your time, won't you try, love
Not a thing you can buy, love
Take your time won't you try love
Not a thing you can buy, love
(Never stop, never giving up)

True, there ain't a minute in the day that's without you
And I'm hoping that you feel and do what you want
What you're feeling I am feeling, too
Never stop, never giving up

Oh, don't baby, baby, oh
Never, never stop
You never, never, never, never, never stop
Never stop, never stop
