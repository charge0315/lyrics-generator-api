Welcome to the club, club for lonely hearts

Left me for a dream
'Cause you thought that the grass was greener
Now you're back crying to me
'Cause you want sympathy from me

Did you think that I
Would take you back just because you're crying
Well, now the joke's on you
'Cause your heart has been broken too

So welcome to the club
Welcome to the lonely nights of tears you gave to me
(Welcome to the club, club for lonely hearts)
Welcome to the club
Now you see how sad it feels to be

Left here all alone
With only your picture to hold on to
You don't know where to turn
'Cause the one that you love is gone

When you said goodbye
You didn't care if I lived or died
So now you'll see for yourself
How it feels to be left behind

So welcome to the club
Welcome to the lonely nights of tears you gave to me
Welcome to the club, club for lonely hearts
Welcome to the club, now you see how sad it feels to be
Welcome to the club, club for lonely hearts

Welcome to the club, club for lonely hearts

Welcome to the club
Welcome to the lonely nights of tears you gave to me
(Welcome to the club, club for lonely hearts)
Welcome to the club
Now you see how sad it feels to be like me
(Welcome to the club, club for lonely hearts)
Welcome to the club
Welcome to the lonely nights of tears you gave to me
(Welcome to the club, club for lonely hearts)
Welcome to the club
Now you see how sad it feels to be hurt like me
(Welcome to the club, club for lonely hearts)

(Welcome to the club, club for lonely hearts)
(Welcome to the club, club for lonely hearts)

You've joined the club for lonely hearts
Club for lonely hearts
You've joined the club for lonely hearts
Club for lonely hearts

(Welcome to the club, club for lonely hearts)
(Welcome to the club, club for lonely hearts)
(Welcome to the club, club for lonely hearts)
