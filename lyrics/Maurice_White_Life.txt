Let's join the dance of life
C'mon join the dance
Let's join the dance of life
C'mon join the dance
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, let's join the dance
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, let's join the dance
Ohhhh
Wake up, generate the feeling
Life knows where you're going, yeah
I know, if we keep believing
There ain't nothing we can't do, ooo
I raise my hand to fight, but there's no war
There's only light shinin' down me, now I'm free
Everybody has the voice
Sing out loud and make a choice
Let freedom ring
Ohh-ohh-ohh-ohh
Life, such a simple joy
Every girl and boy
Open up your heart
And we can start to see the light
Breakin' through the dark
You will play a part
I believe in every special moment we call life, yeah
Reach out, let's become the music
Let's become the song we sing
Some say we don't have the answer
Walking on a streak of dreams
Raise our hands and unify
Raise the roof and justify why we are here
Make it clear, yeah
Everybody has the voice
Sing out loud and make a choice
Let freedom ring
Ohh-ohh-ohh-ohh
Life, every step you take
Every friend you make
Leads you to another place and time
And changes your life
Hold it in your hands
Come and join the dance
You can play a part in every moment, it's your life
Join the dance of life, join the dance
Join the dance of life, join the dance
Join the dance of life, join the dance
Join the dance of life, join the dance
Join the dance of life, join the dance
Join the dance of life
Life, such a simple joy
Every girl and boy
Open up your heart
And we can start to see the light
Breaking through the dark
You will play a part
I believe in e...
Life, every step you take
Every friend you make
Leads you to another place and time
And changes your life
Hold it in your hands
Come and join the dance
You can play a part in every moment we call life
Life, come and reach the high
Make it come alive
Everyday I write another chapter in my life
Hold it in your hands
Come and join the dance
You can play a part in every moment we call life
