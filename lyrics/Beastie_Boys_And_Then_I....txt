Grabbed the beat, looped it up
Saw my check, scooped it up
Rock ignition, got to listen
Change position, start transmission
Point the camera, click the frame
Use a high asa, I like the grain
Flip the script, start to trip
Grabbed my hip, did the dip
Rent the car, go upstate
Hit the waterfall, jump in a lake
Step in the place, move the crowd
Cut the snake, walked right out
Another day slips by
Got to fix the mind
I've got the mind maligned
With I mean mine
Got to turn it around
Got to give back
Because this self-centered thing is keeping me off track
Take the one train, ride the double L
Go to Brooklyn, rock well
Jump the gun, call your bluff
Break the mold, a diamond in the rough
Ran the floor, grabbed a rock
Spot it up, shot the shot
Go pet Sam, said, "get off me"
Check the machine, "Adam this is coffee"
Brace myself, trace myself
Pace myself, lace myself
Check the mirror, start to melt
Jump back, kiss myself
Another day slips by
Got to fix the mind
I've got the mind maligned
With I mean mine
Got to turn it around
Got to give back
Because this self-centered thing is keeping me off track
Hug my Lois, brush her teeth
Read her books, put her to sleep
Pack her lunch, drop her at school
Head to the studio, turn on the pro-tools
Apple C, Apple V
Drop the beat, hit delete
Hit record, smorgasbord
Draw my sword, jump aboard
Grab the phone, call my dad
Shared some love, felt so glad
Went and called Freckles, and I told her I love her
Ran home, got under the covers
Another day slips by
Got to fix the mind
I've got the mind maligned
With I mean mine
Got to turn it around
Got to give back
Because this self-centered thing is keeping me off track
