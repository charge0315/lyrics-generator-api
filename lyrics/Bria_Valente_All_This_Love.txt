All this love
What are you gonna do?
Ooh
Oh oh oh oh
Uh
Oh oh oh oh, oh

Time travel, movin' faster than sound
Secrets lost but now they're found
Spiritual healer, lay your body down
My lips are soft, my hips are round

What are you gonna do?
What are you gonna do?
What are you gonna do with all this love?
What are you gonna do?
What are you gonna do?
What are you gonna do with all this love?

Space travel, we're not movin' at all
I look in your eyes, start to fall
Clothes unravel, Bolivian paper doll
If you don't bounce, we can have a ball

What are you gonna do?
What are you gonna do?
What are you gonna do with all this love?
What are you gonna do?
What are you gonna do?
What are you gonna do with all this love? Tell me

Touch you incessantly
Pitch a tent in your head
Give you the best of what I've got
Everywhere
Honey, please forgive me for what I'm guilty of
What am I gonna do with all this love?

Oh yeah, I want to, want to, babe
What am I gonna do? Ooh
What am I gonna do? To you, I tell
What am I gonna do?

Chakra transfer, inside lookin' out
I'ma take it easy, no need to pout
I'm around you like a hand in glove
Don't worry, you're deep enough

What are you gonna do? Yeah
What are you gonna do?
What are you gonna do with all this love?
What are you gonna do, baby?

Will you want me honey like I want you?
Will you let me do what I want to, want to?
Are you gonna get soft when I wanna play rough?
What are you gonna do with all this love?
Alright
What are you gonna do with all this love?
Tell me, baby
What are you gonna do?

What are you gonna do?
What are you gonna do?
