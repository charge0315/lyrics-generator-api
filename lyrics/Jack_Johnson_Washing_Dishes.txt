In the morning when the world came awake
Before you knew me, I knew your name
It was painted across the day as it breaks
An impression in your window frame

When you saw me out your window, singin' from the garden
Only the beginnin', I'm only gettin' started
I don't mind the diggin', baby, I'll work harder
I've been washin' dishes, singin' from the bottom

But one day I'll be runnin' this place
And one day I could take you away
But I want you to wonder what's my name
'Cause I need you to want me the same

'Cause when you saw me washin' dishes, singin' from the bottom
Only the beginnin', I'm only gettin' started
I don't mind the diggin', baby, I'll work harder
I've been in the ashes, singin' from the garden

Where everything reaches for the sun
Still unsure of what we'll become
But I need you to reach out to me
To see in me more than I could see
'Cause I'm afraid that

One day is only two words we say
I don't want to let them get in the way
All these plans that we should be makin' right now
Right now
'Cause who took the time and where did they take it?
I want to take it back, I don't want to let them break it
All these plans that we should be makin' right now
Right now

You see, now, one day I'll be runnin' this place
And one day I could take you away
But I want you to wonder what's my name
'Cause I need you to want me the same

'Cause when you saw me out your window, singin' from the garden
Only the beginnin', I'm only gettin' started
I don't mind the diggin', baby, I'll work harder
I've been washin' dishes, singin' from the bottom

But one day is only two words we say
I don't want to let them get in the way
All these plans that we should be makin' right now
Right now
Who took the time and where did they take it?
Want to take it back, I don't want to let them break it
All these plans that we should be makin' right now
