You see the world in black and white
No colour or light
You think you'll never get it right
But you're wrong, you might
The sky could fall, could fall on me
The parting of the seas (The seas, the seas, the seas)
But you mean more, mean more to me (To me, to me, to me)
Than any colour I can see

All you ever wanted was love, but you never looked hard enough
It's never gonna give itself up
All you ever wanted to be, livin' in perfect symmetry
Nothin' is as down or up as us
As us

You see the world in black and white
Not painted right
You see no meaning to your life
You should try
You should try

And all you ever wanted was love, but you never looked hard enough
It's never gonna give itself up
And all you ever wanted to be, livin' in perfect symmetry
Nothin' is as down or up as us

And don't you wanna see it come soon
Floatin' in a big white balloon?
Or given on your own silver spoon?
Don't you wanna see it come down
There for throwin' your arms around
And say, "You're not a moment too soon"?

'Cause I feel low
'Cause I feel low, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Yeah, I feel low, oh no
Oh-oh
Oh-oh, 'cause I feel low
'Cause I feel low, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
But I feel low, oh no
Oh-oh
