You know they call it paradise
They say that beauty lies
In the eye of the beholder
I don't know, ask me when I'm older
Ask me when I'm older
See me now, see me now
I know it's coming
Hear it now, hear it now
I hear the voices calling
Feel it now, feel it now
The temperature's rising
See me now, hear it now
I know you've been waiting
You know they call it paradise
For once I won't tell you any lies
Through my eyes it looks much brighter
'Til I'm dead, ask me when I'm older
Just ask me when I'm older
You know they call it paradise
You know they call it paradise
The temperature's rising
The colors are changing
 can't stop it now
 just stop it now
