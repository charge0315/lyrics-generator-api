Ooh, woah

Some days won't end ever and some days pass on by
I'll be working here forever, at least until I die
Damned if you do, damned if you don't
I'm supposed to get a raise next week, you know damn well I won't

Workin' for a livin' (Workin')
Workin' for a livin' (Workin')
Workin' for a livin', livin' and a-workin'
I'm takin' what they're givin' 'cause I'm workin' for a livin'

Hey, I'm not complainin' 'cause I really need the work
But hittin' up my buddy's got me feeling like a jerk
Hundred dollar car note, two hundred rent
I get a check on Friday, but it's already spent

Workin' for a livin' (Workin')
Workin' for a livin' (Workin')
Workin' for a livin', livin' and a-workin' (Oh)
I'm takin' what they're givin' 'cause I'm workin' for a livin'

Woah, woah, workin' for a livin'
Woah, woah, takin' what they're givin'
Woah, woah, workin' for a livin'
Woah, woah

Bus boy, bartender, ladies of the night
Grease monkey, ex-junky, winner of the fight
Walkin' on the streets, its really all the same
Sellin' souls, rock n' roll, any other game

Workin' for a livin' (Workin')
Workin' for a livin' (Workin')
Workin' for a livin', livin' and a-workin' (Oh)
I'm takin' what they're givin' 'cause I'm workin' for a livin'
Workin' for a livin', livin' and a-workin' (Oh)
I'm takin' what they're givin' 'cause I'm workin' for a livin'
Workin' for a livin', livin' and a-workin' (Oh, woo)
