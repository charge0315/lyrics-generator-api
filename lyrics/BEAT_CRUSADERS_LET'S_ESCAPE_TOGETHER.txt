One fine day
On my way
There's a bear
In a deep forest
Run away
Hide away
There's no way
Getting where I belong
But, you wait!
Look away
Here to stay
Too many people
We're afraid
So afraid
Anyway
Why don't we sing along?
Everybody, let's escape together!
Everybody, let's get lost together!
Everybody, let's escape together!
Everybody, let's get lost forever"¦
'Cos I know
Evils in my mind
Get down straight
Close to my heart
Yes, I know
Evils in my mind
Grow
Welcome to the overture
This is the hell
Welcome to the overture
Here comes the time"¦
