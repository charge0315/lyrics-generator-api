Mother, mother
There's too many of you crying
And brother, brother, brother
There's far too many of you dying
You know you've got to find a way
To bring back love here today

Father, father
There's no need to escalate
You see, war is not the answer
For only love can conquer hate
You know we've got to find a way
To bring back lovin' here today

Picket lines (Brother)
And picket signs (Brother)
Don't punish me (Brother)
With brutality (Brother)
Just talk to me (Brother)
So you can see

Ah, what's going on
What's going on
What's going on, yeah
What's going on

Mother, mother
Everybody thinks we're wrong
Who are they to judge us
Just because our hair is long?
You know we've got to find a way
To bring back understanding today

Ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ha
Ah-ah, ah-ah
You know we've got to find a way
To bring back some lovin' here today

Picket lines (Sister)
And picket signs (Sister)
Don't punish me (Sister)
With brutality (Sister)
Now just talk to me (Sister)
So you can see

What's going on
What's going on
Oh, what's going on
Tell me, what's going on?

What's going on
What's going on
What's going on
Yeah, yeah
What's going on, yeah
You tell me, I'll tell you
You tell me, I'll tell you
What's going on, ah
