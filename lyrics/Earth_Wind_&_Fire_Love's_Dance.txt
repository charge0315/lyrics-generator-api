Ooh, baby... like a melody ride
Baby it's time, it's fun, fun time
Just take the time, to free your mind
It's bona fide, to move your body
Natural high, can you feel the vibe
Get on the rise, move your hips from side to side
Let's enjoy, life's reward
We can soar, through heaven's door
Touch the sun, let's become one rhythm
'Cause the way your energy is affecting me, yeah
Ooh, I wanna party with you (I wanna boogie down)
Diggin' on the way that you move
Dancin' in love's groove (I sure do)
Close to you (I sure do, baby)
Ooh, I wanna party with you
Diggin' everything that you do
Dancin' in love's groove (I sure do)
Close to you (I sure do, baby)
Gon' get, get, get, get on down
Gon' get, get, get, get on down
Gon' get, get, get, get on down (get down)
Gon' get, get, get, get on down
Girl the mood is right
For me to be with you tonight
So let's get intertwined, let's fly
Love is in the air
Baby nothin' else is better
'Cause we're the perfect pair
We're one of millions of lovers
And feelin' love is sent from above
(Dance) Show me if you feel it, dance
(Dance) Come on do it with me, dance
(Dance) Make romance, let's dance
(Love's dance) ooh, ooh (love's dance)
Ooh, I wanna party with you
Diggin' on the way that you move
Dancin' in love's groove (I sure do)
Close to you (I sure do, baby)
Ooh, I wanna party with you
Diggin' everything that you do
Dancin' in love's groove
Close to you
Gon' get, get, get, get on down
Gon' get, get, get, get on down
Gon' get, get, get, get on down
Dancin' in love's groove
Close to you
Ooh, I wanna party with you
(I wanna party down) The way that you move
Dancin' in love's groove
Close to you
Get on, get on come on, come on
Get on, get on come on, come on
Diggin' everything that you do
Dancin' in love's groove
Close to you
I sure do baby, I sure do
I sure do baby, I sure do
I sure do baby
Dancin' in love's groove
Close to you
