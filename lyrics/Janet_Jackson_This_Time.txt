After all I've done for you

This time I'm not gonna stay, this time I must get away
This time you've gone too far, yeah, yeah
This time I'm not gonna stay, this time you've got to pay
This time you've gone too far

You runnin' 'round with those nasty hoes
How long did ya think I could take this?
You said to me, "That's the way life goes"
How long did ya think I could take this?
I should have known, oh, you weren't for real
But my love for you kept on strong
You better know you're gonna miss my love
Now you know that I'm not still holdin' on
That's right, all of my friends say

This time I'm not gonna stay, this time I must get away
This time you've gone too far, yeah, yeah
This time I'm not gonna stay, this time you've got to pay
This time you've gone too far

You've played the game, but you've played yourself
Oh, boy, take a look at who's sorry now
You're not the same, oh, how you have changed
So now look at you, it's a damn shame
I don't care if I never, ever see your face again
You broke my heart one too many times, oh
You think that I'm, I'm just not that strong
My bags are packed, watch me walk right through that door

This time I'm not gonna stay, this time I must get away
This time you've gone too far (Really gone too far)
This time I'm not gonna stay, this time you've got to pay
This time you've gone too far

Walkin' 'round with nasty hoes
Tellin' me, "That's the way life goes"
No, baby, you're takin' it way too far
Said to me that I'm not that strong
Watch me walk right through that door
Oh yeah, yeah

This time I'm not gonna stay, this time I must get away
This time you've gone too far (Really gone too far)
This time I'm not gonna stay, this time you've got to pay
This time you've gone too far

This time I'm not gonna stay, this time I must get away
This time you've gone too far
This time I'm not gonna stay, this time you've got to pay
This time you've gone too far

Gone too far, gone too far
Gone too far, gone too far, gone too far

This time I'm not gonna stay, this time I must get away
This time you've gone too far, gone too far, gone too far
This time I'm not gonna stay, this time you've got to pay
This time you've gone too far, gone too far, gone too far

You're dismissed
