Days full of rain
Sky's coming down again
I get so tired
Of these same old blues
Same old song
Baby, it won't be long
'Fore I'll be tyin' on
My flyin' shoes
Flyin' shoes
Flyin' shoes
'Til I'll be tyin' on
My flyin' shoes
Spring only sighed
Summer had to be satisfied
Fall has a feeling that I just can't lose
I'd like to stay
And watch a winter's day
Turn the green water
To white and blue
Flyin' shoes
Flyin' shoes
'Till I'll be tyin' on
My flyin' shoes
The mountain moon
Forever sets too soon
And bein' alone is all the hills can do
Alone and then
Her silver sails again
And I will follow
In their flyin' shoes
Flyin' shoes
I will follow in their
Flyin' shoes
Days full of rain
Sky's coming down again
I get so tired
Of the same old blues
Same old song
Baby, it won't be long
Till I be tyin' on
My flyin' shoes
Flyin' shoes
