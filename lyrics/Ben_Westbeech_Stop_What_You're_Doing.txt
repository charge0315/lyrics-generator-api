I love the beat It's ??? cus I know It's what I'm meant to do in this life
It makes me feel so wonderful inside you know this gets you up you wanna dance
Let's take it back when things were simple and the moods will swing you round and round your head
Just grab a partner waltz 'em round and you will feel the music running through your veins
I wanna see the movements turn the lights up take each other by the hand and feel it
See the dresses flowing people knowing this is what they came to do tonight
Look each other in the eyes let the weather move your body close together
Take the time to realize just why you're here we're gonna dance the night away
Stop what you're doing
Everybody come around
Just drop what you're doing
There's a brand new dance going down
Stop what you're doing
Everybody come around
Drop what you're doing
There's a brand new dance going down
What you're doing take your partner by the waist and let me orchestrate the dance floor
It's time to put your drink down take your jacket off and leave your ego at the door
Whatever happened to the times when it was all about the people getting down
So come and gather lets enjoy the party sip a drink and we gon' have a dance now
A beauty in your ears is why we're cooking up using the basting ???
Touch the sides within your heart that make you tingle twist and wanna make you jump with joy
So everybody join your hands and feel the energy inside the place arising
You were smiling feeling good and then the ?? worked and this is not surprising
Stop what you're doing
Everybody come around
Just drop what you're doing
There's a brand new dance going down
Stop what you're doing
Everybody come around
Drop what you're doing
There's a brand new dance going down
