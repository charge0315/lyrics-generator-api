Why does this man
Defy the storm and burn us all?
Each time his hand waves
The sun, it sets on lonely graves
Haven't we read this page before?

We're gonna lose the war
Put down the glory flag
Nothing will be the same
This is the world he wants
Pray for the brave and the young
It won't bring them back again

Stillness, you know that it reigns supreme
And suffocates our only dream
No birds can sing here
They've flown away, they didn't even say
When they'd be back again
Will they come back again?

Unleash the hounds of hell
Whip up the fury wind
Hidden inside his dome
This is the world he wants
Pray for the brave and the young
He knows they're not coming home

Now do you ever, ever get the feeling?
Ever get the feeling?
This is the world that he wants
Do you ever get the feeling?
Ever get the feeling?
This is the world that he wants
This is the world he wants
This is the world he wants
