I first saw it when you were smiling
I could tell something was wrong
And the way you were laughing
It just lasted too long
As if you were trying hard
To pretend everything was fine
When I knew deep in my heart
That it was all just falling apart
Let's run away from the path
We used to take each day
And then we'll face the aftermath
Of our yesterdays
Is it me or are we really
Going out of our minds?
I'd never thought I would be
Somebody not so kind
I don't want to bring you down
But there's no one else around
It's like walking in a ghost town
Or living six feet under ground
Let's run away from the path
We used to take each day
And then we'll face the aftermath
Of our yesterdays
That's what I'd love to say
I know I'll find a way
Let's run away from the path
We used to take each day
And then we'll face the aftermath
Of our yesterdays
