Sooner or later that spark just disappears
Outta nowhere, outta nowhere
Every time one of us ending up in tears
Outta nowhere, outta nowhere
Is it good that we hurt every day?
Is this worth all the pain that we feel inside?
Am I too blind to see this is happening to me?
Outta nowhere, outta nowhere

I lived the fast life (Yeah), going nowhere fast
I seen my past life and politely passed
But I'm already planning on doin' it big
For my life after death and live my life after death (Baby)
Baby, what you think all the training is for? (Uh-huh)
Just to properly prepare you for war (Ha)
So I keep you on your toes
If you look out for them friends that are really foes
This career tried to swallow us (Swallow us)
Paparazzi tried to follow us (Follow us)
I'm everything my momma was
Rider, survivor, a motherfuckin' fighter
Thank god for this rapping shit (Thank you)
Forget the cash, it's about happiness (Yeah)
Normal life, that’s for the birds
I work hard so you never say these words

Outta nowhere, outta nowhere

The critics goin' nowhere (Nowhere)
Thinking that they know me like the Bible, oh hell no
But they don't understand me, oh well
Snitching is a sport now, so please, do tell
The world I raise hell (Yeah)
Yeah, I did the crime, but I skip jail (Yeah)
I’m just trying to own teams, get it player
And dance on the globe like Fred Astaire (Haha)
The world is ours, baby (Baby)
It’s just waiting for us so don’t be late (Don't be late)
And we can both aim for the sky
And shoot for the stars and call it a date (Haha)
Now you know that I know that we know
If the world wants war, cock back and reload (Haha)
A normal life, that’s for the birds (Birds)
I work hard, so you never say these words (Woo)

I pop up outta nowhere, Is that Jamie? (Uh-huh, oh yeah)
If Rihanna and Chris Brown can work it through
Then anything is workable (Workable)
And if the world does try to break us up
Just let 'em know that they got some more work to do
There's no such thing as a perfect love (Perfect love)
But there is such thing as a perfect thus (Perfect thus)
There's one thing that I'm certain of
I say you learn to love, same day you learn to trust
What woman don't love a man who works hard?
No matter where I work, loving be my first job
I clock in, never clock out, I say it's my time
Go and tell 'em, "Watch out!"
But I need you on the side of me
Bust back and stay low like the economy
There's nothing that we try to be
Thank God, robbing Pit took a shot on me
