Uh huh
Chico, A+
(I got you baby)
Crazy
Yo

I've been around this world and back
It ain't a thing, in LAX or you in Manhattan
Times Square to be exact
Had on a black felt hat, I felt that
Nothing but name brands on the bags in your hand
It was a hot day, you was just a block away
As I reminisce, boo, I had a lot to say
Try to zig-zag through the crowd to track you down
Out of nowhere you just disappeared downtown
Now, can't believe we standing face to face
Kinda loud in here like , I say we blow this place
No fronting, I know what you've been wanting
Like to travel? We can go to Jamaica every month then
I see your man slipping, as soon as he start flipping
I'm moving with my all-around game, it's Scotty Pippen
Holding down mines and sport matching shines and
And long as you're mine I'll treat you likе a diamond

It's on you, baby
Whatever you wanna do, girl
You know I got your back

I played it back and watchеd them fake cats shoot they rap
They all whack, love the way you shook them off the broad strap
Had to meet you, all along I was scheming
Had to touch that to make sure I wasn't dreaming
You shining, gleaming, we perfect teaming
I'm a rapper but damn, you make a cat want to start singing
Don't play no games, tell me your name
Show some love so you dissing all them thugs in the club
Offering to buy you drinks, gold links and minks
Told his man shorty acting like his shit don't stink
You got me going crazy, almost out of my mind
Ain't tryna be a player, you done heard every line
I know exactly what you need
A brother that's real, will be around
Won't leave you stuck with the seed
Now that's two mouths to feed on a small budget
You must have been there before
Because you're scared to let me touch it

Who keeps it live from beginning to end
But by your side, girlfriend, when them lights get dim
Keep it tighter, the ice on the , I play to win
The word is, on the street, you making mice out of men
But I don't blaming her for keeping one beneath the table
So when he gets unfaithful, you can drop him like a record label
I see your visions when I close my eyes
If I had a wish, touch them lips, hold them thighs
Caress your mind, body and soul, take a
Sit back, enjoy the ride as we cruise and
You act bold, got me calling you black gold
A hidden treasure, without A+, you lost forever
Got to get you, me and you the perfect picture
I know you think I'm game, all I want to do is hit you
I figured, you can get with this or that
If you were smart, sweetheart, you'd play the part
And where you at?
