Baby, how many times have I told you –
You can't hang on to the past?
Well, you know I'm not trying to scold you, baby
But the years are moving fast

And it comes as no surprise to me
There's nothing left for you
So I offer my philosophy (I offer my philosophy)
The one thing you should do

Carry on
Though it may be hard to understand it
You've got to carry on
Carry on
Things may not work out the way you planned it
You've got to carry on

Tell me how could he ever believe you, baby?
Who could wade through all the lies?
You were thinking that love would go on forever
But he saw through your disguise

And it comes as no surprise to me
There's nothing left for you
So I offer my philosophy (I offer my philosophy)
The one thing you should do

Carry on
Though it may be hard to understand it
You've got to carry on
Carry on
Things may not turn out the way you planned it
You've got to carry on, oh-oh

Carry on
Though it may be hard to understand it
You've got to carry on
Carry on, you've got to carry on
Things may not turn out the way you planned it
You've got to carry on
