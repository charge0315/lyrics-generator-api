I need to fight
And I need to break all these chains for all time
I wanna sit out in the rain
And I wanna feel my heart again

I am blessed
I am blessed
I am blessed
You don't need to tell me
I am blessed
I am blessed
I am blessed
You don't need to tell me
I know that hope and love can be found in this world

And I need to find
The roads and the rivers that will lead me home
I'm gonna sit out in the rain
And I'm gonna feel my heart again

I am blessed
I am blessed
I am blessed
You don't need to tell me
I am blessed
I am blessed
I am blessed
You don't need to tell me
I know that hope and love can be found in this world

I'll follow your lead
Oh, Lord, help me please
If there is a road, I'll gladly follow
(I'll gladly go)
I'll gladly follow
(I'll gladly follow)

And everyone knows
All that is glittering is not gold
And I've gotta say
I really wasn't born that way
I'm going where the sky meets the dawn
I'm going where the stars meet the shore
Won't you come down?

I am blessed
I am blessed
I am blessed
You don't need to tell me
I am blessed
I am blessed
I am blessed
You don't need to tell me
I know that hope and love can be found in this world

Can be found
Love can be found in this world
Can be found
Love can be found in this world
Can be found
Love can be found in this world
(Love) Can be found
Love can be found in this world
(Love is on its way)
Can be found
Love can be found in this world
(Hope) Can be found
Love can be found in this world
(Hope is on its way)
Can be found
Love can be found in this world
(Love) Can be found
Love can be found in this world
(Love is on its way)
Can be found
Love can be found in this world
(Hope) Can be found
Love can be found in this world
(Hope is on its way)
Can be found
Love can be found in this world
