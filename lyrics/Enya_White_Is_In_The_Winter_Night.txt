Have you seen the mistletoe?
It fills the night with kisses
Have you seen the bright new star?
It fills your heart with wishes
Have you seen the candlelight?
It shines from every window
Have you seen the moon above?
It lights the sky in silver

Green is in the mistletoe
And red is in the holly
Silver in the stars above
That shine on everybody
Gold is in the candlelight and
Crimson in the embers
White is in the winter night
That everyone remembers

Have you heard the boys all sigh
When all the girls are skating?
Have you heard the sweetheart's cry
For all this time they're waiting?

Green is in the mistletoe
And red is in the holly
Silver in the stars above
That shine on everybody
Gold is in the candlelight and
Crimson in the embers
White is in the winter night
That everyone remembers

Have you seen the children playing?
Tiny hands are frozen!
Have you seen them hurry home
When suddenly it's snowing!

Green is in the mistletoe
And red is in the holly
Silver in the stars above
That shine on everybody
Gold is in the candlelight and
Crimson in the embers
White is in the winter night
That everyone remembers

Have you heard the bells are ringing
Ringing out their story?
Have you heard the choir singing?
Glory! Glory! Glory!
