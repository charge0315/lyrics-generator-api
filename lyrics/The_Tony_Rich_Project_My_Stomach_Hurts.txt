Shots go by
Right in the heart
Bare skin, showered and glazed
Strut across the living blaze
And gasoline
Striking the match
As it blows
She grows her wings
And she flies away
'Cause it hurts
My stomach hurts
Without my angel, I
I fade away in the night
'Cause it hurts
My mind works
To fight that demon in disguise
She fades away in the night
Dripping me
Into her hands
Clean glands, organs of truth
Hunting for a vision or view
Broken start
Could I believe?
That she's coming back I doubt
'Cause she flies away so easily
'Cause it hurts
My stomach hurts
Without my angel, I
I fade away in the night
'Cause it hurts
My mind works
To fight that demon in disguise
She fades away in the night
Take it away
It's not fair
That it's gone and I still stare
At the wings' imprint in my heart
Come back
Just maybe I'll have the chance
To repair the pain you left
I want to share cause it hurts
'Cause it hurts
My stomach hurts
Without my angel, I
I fade away in the night
'Cause it hurts
My mind works
To fight that demon in disguise
She fades away in the night
