You asked me why
But I don't have a clue
I have no words to throw back at you
See what love can do
You say right now that you don't feel a thing
I wonder how is that really what you mean
Are you listening
I don't deserve to hurt this way
You can do damage with words you say, baby
Any other time those words might hurt me
Any other time, hooh whoa
Any other time my mind just walk away
Maybe it's true something's in the air
We talk all night but we get nowhere
Do you even care
I have tried a way I'll go
How can you tell me to just let go
Any other time those words might hurt me
Any other time, hooh whoa
Any other time my mind just walk away
Any other time
Any other time those words might hurt me
I see by the look in your eyes
That you just don't believe we'll make it this time
You're trying to harden your heart
But the real work begins when love comes upon
We could turn back after all these years
We could walk on down along tears
