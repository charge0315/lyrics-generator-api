Oh, said I wonder
Yes, I wonder
Yes, I wonder
Oh, said I wonder
Yes, I wonder
Yes, I wonder

I know that I'm afraid of love
The toll seems very steep
The goal's so uncontrollable
Impossible to keep
Despite the songs of lucky ones
Those very special few
Can't right the wrongs that often come
No matter what we do

And, so I wonder (Oh, so I wonder)
Will I win, or will I lose?
Tell me, yeah, yeah (Oh, so I wonder)
Will I win, or will I lose?

Now, I imagine that the feeling's close to none
All that passion running rampant sounds like fun
But when the trouble starts
I've heard of broken hearts
So must come down familiar ground
To find a safer view

And, so I wonder (Oh, so I wonder)
Will I win, or will I lose?
Tell me, yeah (Oh, so I wonder)
Will I win (Yes, I wonder), or will I lose?

(The journey must be made)
The journey must be made
The hand is dealt, it must be played
(It comes to all of us)
It comes to all of us
You can't escape our dues, ooh
(I'm still holding back)
I'm still holding back
I want my heart intact, yeah
Until the time that I'm unable to refuse

Inconsequential if I stumble up the rocks
Or catapulted if I shoot right to the top
When I on love depend
My only question then

Ooo (Oh, so I wonder)
Will I win, or will I lose?
Tell me, yeah (Oh, so I wonder)
Will I win (Yes, I wonder), or will I lose? (Yes, I wonder)
Tell me, yeah (Oh, so I wonder)
Will I win (Yes, I wonder), or will I lose? (Yes, I wonder)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (Oh, so I wonder)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (Yes, I wonder, yes I wonder)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
So I wonder, so I wonder
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
So I wonder, yeah
Alright
(Oh, so I wonder)
Yes, I wonder (Yes, I wonder), yes, I wonder (Yes, I wonder)
(Yes, I wonder) Yes, I wonder
(Oh, so I wonder)
So I wonder (Yes, I wonder), so I wonder (Yes, I wonder)
Yes, I wonder
Yes, I wonder, yes, I wonder
Yeah
