What you see may only be skin deep
But what you feel inside is there for keeps
Can't know happiness 'till you've been sad
But tears drown all the joy you ever had
Talkin' about people
Who spreads wanton hurt
Talkin' about people
Still waiting for their turn
Talkin' about people
Living in uncertainty
Ordinary people
People like you and me
Seen your life before you slip away
Hanging on to every Irish day
Can't keep up the face
But can't slow down
Life's a rat race there's no short way around
Talkin' about people
Who didn't make the grade
Talkin' about people
Who's just another paid
Talkin about people
Holdin' on for dignity
Ordinary people
People like you and me
You may have nothing else but you've got pride
You have nothing else but you've got pride
Until there's nothing to sacrifice
We'll survive
We'll survive
Talkin' about people
Talkin' about people
Existing from day to day
Talkin' about people
Who lost their way
Talkin' about people
Living by destiny
Ordinary people
Like you and me
When hunger bites you deep down inside
You may have nothing else but you've got pride
And when there's nowhere to run or hide
You'll find there's no short cut and there's no rewrite
Until there's nothing to sacrifice
We'll survive
Never give up till it's gone
Together we'll be strong
We'll survive
(Spoken)
In this we breathe the same air
We cherish our children
Never give up until it's gone
We'll survive
