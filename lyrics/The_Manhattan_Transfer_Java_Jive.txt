I love coffee, I love tea
I love the Java Jive and it loves me
Coffee and tea and the java and me
A cup, a cup, a cup, a cup, a cup (Ah!)
I love java, sweet and hot
Whoops, Mr. Moto, I'm a coffee pot
Shoot me the pot, and I'll pour me a shot
A cup, a cup, a cup, a cup, a cup
Oh, slip me a slug from that wonderful mug
And I'll cut a rug, 'till I'm snug in a jug
A slice of onion and a raw one
Draw one -
(Waiter, waiter, percolator)
I love coffee, I love tea
I love the Java Jive and it loves me
Coffee and tea and the java and me
A cup, a cup, a cup, a cup, a cup (Ah!)
Boston bean (soy beans)
I said, them little itty bitty green beans (cabbage and greens)
I'm not keen about a bean
Unless it is a chilly chili bean (Talk it boy!)
I love java, sweet and hot
Whoops, Mr. Moto, I'm a coffee pot (yeah)
Shoot me the pot and I'll pour me a shot
A cup, a cup, a cup, a dat zan bozzle (oooh)
Slip me a slug of that wonderful mug
And I'll cut a rug that's snug in a jug
Drop your nickel in my pot, Joe
Takin' it slow
Waiter, waiter, percolator
I love coffee, I love tea
I love the Java Jive and it loves me
Coffee and tea and the java and me
A cup, a cup, a cup, a cup, boy!
