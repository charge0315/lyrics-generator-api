Traveling light (light) is the only way to fly
Traveling light, just you and I
A one way ticket to ecstasy
Away on down, just follow me
Traveling light (light) is the only way to fly

Traveling light (light), now we can catch the wind
Traveling light (light), just let your mind pretend
We can go to paradise
Maybe once, maybe twice
Traveling light (light) is the only way to fly
