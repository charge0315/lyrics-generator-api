(Slow musical interlude)
(Piano solo)
I used to spend most of my time just being alone
Yes I did
Nothing to do, no place to go
Just stayed at home
So I put my blues up on the shelf
And I made up my mind to live a little myself
So I went on down to the disco
Disco
That's where the happy people go.  (Happy people go)
And they're just dancing along to a perfect song
Down at the disco
Disco
That's where the happy people go
And they're just dancing along to a perfect song
Down at the disco
Now listen
All my friends, they wondered what's come over me, yeah
They all say I'm not the same old guy I used to be, yeah
First of all, I got myself together
I danced my blues away, they're gone forever
Then I ease on down to the disco
