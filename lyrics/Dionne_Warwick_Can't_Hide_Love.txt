Ooh-ooh-ooh...
Ooh-ooh-ooh...
You want my love, then you can't deny
You know it's true, but you try to hide
You turn down love like it's really bad
You can't give what you never had
Well, bless your soul, you can fool a few
But, I know the truth and so do you
You want my love, well, I'l betcha
Oh-oh-oh, well, I betcha
You want my love, yeah, I betcha
Oh-whoa, feel inside
Ooh-ooh-ooh...
Ooh-ooh-ooh...
You can't pretend there's nothing there
Boy, I looked in your eyes
And I see that you care
So why not stop tryin' to run and hide
'Cause you won't find love
Not if you never, never try
You can't hide love, well, I'll betcha
Oh-oh-oh, well, I betcha
You can't hide love, well, I'll betcha
Whoa-oh, feeling inside
Now's the time to try to find
All you're missin'
(Love is gonna getcha)
Now's the time to try to find
More kissin'
(Love is gonna getcha)
Now's the time to try to find
More huggin'
(Love is gonna getcha)
Now's the time to try to find
More lovin'
Lovin' you
You know you can't hide love
You know you can't hide love
Love is gonna getcha
Love is gonna getcha
You know you can't hide love
Love is gonna getcha
Love is gonna getcha
You know you can't hide love
Love is gonna getcha
Love is gonna getcha
You know you can't hide love
Love is gonna getcha
Love is gonna getcha
You know you can't hide love...
