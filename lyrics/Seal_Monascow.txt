Walking down a Grace Avenue on a sex and sweaty night
Looking for a body to please ‘cause it's how I like it
Waiting for that devil to call when she’s wrong she’ll be so right
Hunger burning deep in my eyes ‘cause I just can’t hide it
Your the only woman that can bring me to my knees
The things you do to me you do to me baby
Girl you look on fire you just make me want to please, the things you do to me you do to me baby
I want you now
(escape)
Got no watch but I got the cash
Sam the man he knows what time
Drink a glass or two at the sass ‘ain’t the food I’m buying
Because tonight I'll be a black billionaire
Me and Flav are tight
Drink and raise our glass to the air ‘cause the people buyin’
Your the only woman that can bring me to my knees
The things you do to me (you do to me baby)
Girl you look on fire you just make me want to please
The things you do to me (you do to me baby) you do to me baby
I want you now
Been waiting for a miracle
And know you’ve come lets just  take all night
Not looking for a spiritual, it’s sexual
I just need your time
Lets go and dance their playing Monascow
Let go and dance escape
Escape, escape
Baby someone’s got to love you tonight
We can dance now baby till morn
Someones gotta love you
I just want to love you
Lets go and dance their playing Monascow
Lets go and dance escape
Nightlife the fame
My life a game
One night with you
Down grace avenue
