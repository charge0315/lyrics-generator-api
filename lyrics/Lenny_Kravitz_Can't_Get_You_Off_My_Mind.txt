Life is just a lonely highway
I'm out here on the open road
I'm old enough to see behind me
But young enough to feel my soul
I don't wanna lose you, baby
And I don't wanna be alone
Don't wanna live my days without you
But for now I've got to be without you

I've got a pocket full of money
And a pocket full of keys that have no bounds
But then I think of loving
And I just can't get you off of my mind
Yeah

Babe, can't you see
That this is killing me?
I don't wanna push you, baby
And I don't want you to be told
It's just that I can't breathe without you
Feel like I'm gonna lose control

I've got a pocket full of money — ah, yes I do
And a pocket full of keys that have no bounds
But when it comes to loving
I just can't get you off of my mind
Yeah

Am I a fool to think that there's a little hope?
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Tell me baby, yeah
What are the rules, the reasons and the do's and don'ts?
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Tell me, baby; tell me, baby, yeah
What do you feel inside?

I've got a pocket full of money
And a pocket full of keys that have no bounds
Oh yeah
But when it comes down to loving
I just can't get you off of my mind
Yeah

I just can't get you off of my mind
Yeah
