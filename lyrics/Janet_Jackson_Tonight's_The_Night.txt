This is just between me and you, and you

Stay away from my window
Stay away from my back door too
Disconnect the telephone line
Relax, baby, and draw that blind
Kick off your shoes and sit right down
Loosen up the back of your pretty French gown, yeah
Let me pour you a good long drink
Ooh, baby, don't you hesitate

Tonight's the night
It's gonna be alright
'Cause I love you, girl
Ain't nobody gonna stop us now

Come on, angel, my heart's on fire
Don't deny this one desire
You'll be a fool to stop this time
Spread your wings and let me come inside

'Cause
Tonight's the night
It's gonna be alright
'Cause I love you, girl
Ain't nobody gonna stop us now

Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight's the night
Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight's the night
Tonight's the night, tonight's the night, tonight's the night

Don't say a word, my virgin child
Just let your inhibitions run wild
The secret is about to unfold
Upstairs before the night's too old

'Cause
Tonight's the night (Tonight's the night)
It's gonna be alright
'Cause I love you, girl
Ain't nobody gonna stop us now
Tonight
Tonight's the night
Tonight's the night (Tonight's the night)
It's gonna be alright (Tonight's the night)
'Cause I love you, boy
Ain't nobody gonna stop us now

This is so special

Tonight's the night
Don't be afraid
You know I'm gonna make it alright
Tonight's the night
Don't be afraid
I'm gonna make things alright
Tonight's the night
Don't be afraid
You know I'm gonna make it alright
Tonight's the night
Don't be afraid
I'm gonna make things alright
Tonight's the night
Don't be afraid

Please, don't leave
I don't wanna be left all alone
