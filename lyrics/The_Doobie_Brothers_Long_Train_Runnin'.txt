Down around the corner, half a mile from here
You see them long trains runnin' and you watch 'em disappear

Without love
Where would you be now?
Without love

You know, I saw Miss Lucy down along the tracks
She lost her home and her family and she won't be coming back

Without love
Where would you be right now?
Without love

Well, the Illinois Central and the Southern Central Freight
Got to keep on pushin', mama, 'cause you know they're runnin' late

Without love
Where would you be now, na-na-now?
Without love

Well, the Illinois Central and the Southern Central Freight
Got to keep on pushin', mama, 'cause you know they're runnin' late

Without love
Where would you be now?
Without love

Well, pistons keep on churnin' and the wheels go 'round and 'round
And the steel rails lie cold and hard on the mountains they go down

Without love
Where would you be right now?
Without love
Ooh, where would you be now?

Mmm, got to get you, baby, baby, won't you move it down?
Won't you move it down?
Baby, baby, baby, baby, won't you move it down?
When the big train run
When the train is movin' on
I got to keep on movin'
Keep on movin'
Won't you keep on movin'?
Gonna keep on movin'
