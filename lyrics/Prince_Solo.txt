So low, the curb looks like a skyscraper
So high, the stars are under me
So quiet, I can hear the blood rushing through my veins
So low, I feel like I'm going insane
The angels, they watch in wonder
When you made love to me
Through the rain and the thunder
You cried in ecstasy
And you were so kind
I felt sorry for all creation
Because at the time, no one was lucky
No one was lucky, no one was lucky as me
And now you're gone and I just wanna be still
So silent, I'll just let my senses sleep
It's going to be so hard to hear my voice
If I ever learn once more to speak
I'm so lost, no one can find me
And I've been looking for so long
But now I'm done
I'm so low, solo, my name is no one
