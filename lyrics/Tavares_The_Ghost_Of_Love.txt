The ghost of love keeps haunting me
Although you're gone, I can't get free
Just when I think (When I think) I'm over you (I'm over you)
The ghost of love says "peek-a-boo"
Peek-a-boo (Peek-a-boo), I see you (I see you)
May all your nights be full of fright
And all your days be blue

You went away, I met this girl
Night and day, she shared my world
Just when I thought I had forgot
That loving spell, you weave so well

Suddenly that look comes on my face
And I start staring way out of space
I know why, the girl stopped coming round
The ghost of love has done run her out of town

The ghost of love keeps haunting me
Although you're gone, I can't get free
Just when I think (When I think) I'm over you (I'm over you)
The ghost of love says "peek-a-boo"
Peek-a-boo (Peek-a-boo), I see you (I see you)
May all your nights be full of fright
And all your days be blue

Your love has died, but mine won't rest
This feeling for you is jumping in my chest
No one else, can fill the bill
I'll wait for your return and pray that you will

Round about the midnight hour
I start to feel your loving power
Right away, I'm tossing in my sleep
Daybreak finds me wrapped up in my sheets
The ghost of love (Ghost of love)
Is haunting me (Is haunting me) (Haunting me)

The ghost of love (Ghost of love) keeps haunting me (Haunting me)
Although you're gone (Although you're gone), I can't get free (Can't get free)
Just when I think (When I think) I'm over you (I'm over you)
The ghost of love (Ghost of love) says "peek-a-boo"

The ghost of love (Ghost of love) keeps haunting me (Haunting me)
Although you're gone (Ghost of love), I can't get free
Just when I think (When I think) I'm over you (I'm over you)
The ghost of love (Ghost of love)
The ghost of love
Keeps haunting me
Peek-a-boo (Peek-a-boo), I see you (I see you)
May all your nights, be full of fright
Peek-a-boo (Peek-a-boo), I see you (I see you)
And all your days, be blue blue blue blue
The ghost of love (Ghost of love) (Ghost of love)
Is haunting me (Haunting me) (Haunting me) (Haunting me)
Oh
Can't get no sleep, wrapped up in my sheets
Full of fright, every night
That loving spell
You weave so well

Peek-a-boo (Peek-a-boo), I see you (I see you)
May all your nights be full of fright
Peek-a-boo (Peek-a-boo), I see you (I see you)
And all your days be blue
The ghost of love (Ghost of love) (Ghost of love)
Is haunting me (Is haunting me) (Haunting me) (Haunting me) (Haunting me)
Hey
The ghost of love, is haunting me
Though you're gone, I can't get free
Just when I think, I'm over you
The ghost of love, said "peek-peek-a-boo"
Peek-a-boo (Peek-a-boo), I see you (I see you)
Peek-a-boo (Peek-a-boo), I see you (I see you)
Oh
The ghost of love (Ghost of love)
Is haunting me (Haunting me)
