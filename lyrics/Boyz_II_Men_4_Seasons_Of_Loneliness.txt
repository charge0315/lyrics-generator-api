Oh-oh
Yeah, yeah, oh-woah
Oh, oh, woah
Ooh

I long for
The warmth of
Days gone by
When you were mine
But now those days are memories in time
My life's empty
Without you
By my side
My heart belongs to you
No matter what I try

When I get the courage up to love somebody new
It always falls apart 'cause they just can't compare to you
Your love won't release me, I'm bound under ball and chain
Reminiscing our love as I watch four seasons change

In comes the winter breeze
That chills the air and drifts the snow (I imagine)
And I imagine kissing you under the mistletoe (When spring)
When springtime makes its way here
Lilac blooms reminds me of (Oh, I)
The scent of your perfume (I imagine when summer burns)
When summer burns with heat
I always get the hots for you (Ooh)
Go skinny dippin' in the ocean
Where we used to do (When autumn sheds)
When autumn sheds, the leaves
The trees are bare when you're not here
It doesn't feel the same
(It doesn't feel the same, oh)

Remember
The nights when (Remember the night)
We closed our eyes (When we closed our eyes)
And vowed that you and I
Would be in love for all time

Every time I think about these things I shared with you
I break down and cry 'cause I get so emotional (I get so emotional)
Until you release me, I'm bound under ball and chain (Release me)
Reminiscing our love as I watch four seasons change

In comes the winter breeze
That chills the air and drifts the snow
And I imagine kissing you under the mistletoe (Under mistletoe)
When springtime makes its way here
Lilac blooms reminds me of
The scent of your perfume
When summer burns with heat
I always get the hots for you
Go skinny dippin' in the ocean where we used to do
When autumn sheds the leaves the trees are bare
When you're not here
It doesn't feel the same

This loneliness has crushed my heart (It's killing me, baby)
Please let me love again (I just wanna know if I can fix this)

'Cause I need your love to comfort me and ease my pain (Oh, yeah)
Or four seasons will bring the loneliness again

In comes the winter breeze
That chills the air and drifts the snow (No-oh)
And I imagine kissing you under the mistletoe (Kissing you where we used to kiss, baby)
When springtime makes its way here
Lilac blooms reminds me of
The scent of your perfume (When summers burn)
When summer burns with heat (Oh, when summers burn)
I always get the hots for you
Go skinny dippin' in the ocean where we used to do (Go skinny dippin', hey-hey)
When autumn sheds the leaves the trees are bare (Ooh-ooh)
When you're not here
It doesn't feel the same
(It doesn't feel the same)

Remember
The warmth of
Days gone by (Days gone by)
