I'm taking four strands of your hair
And a five dollar bill
I'm gonna put it in a letter
I'm gonna drop it in the mail
I'm gonna send it to a woman
That a friend of mine told me about
She's a gumbo cooker and an alligator whipper
Make a dead man jump and shout
Talking about a woman named Hannah
Down in Louisiana
Oh, she's a mojo worker
She's gonna work that thing for me
She's gonna hear my misery
And I know he'll be coming on home soon
She don't wear fancy stitches
All she wears is a man's britches
And now and then she takes a little sip
She's got a forty-five on her hip
She's built up a reputation in the southern land
Saturday night about twelvе o'clock
You know she voodoos the voodoo man
Talking about a woman named Hannah
Down in Louisiana
Oh, shе's a mojo worker
She's gonna work that thing for me
She's gonna hear my misery
And I know he'll be coming on home soon
Mojo Hannah, she's the best in all the land
Mojo Hannah, I know she's gonna find my man
I'm gonna be sitting there by the railroad track
And I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
He'll be coming back
I'm taking four strands of your hair
And a five dollar bill
I'm gonna put it in a letter
I'm gonna drop it in the mail
I'm gonna send it to a woman
That a friend of mine told me about
She's a gumbo cooker and an alligator whipper
Make a dead man jump and shout
Talking about a woman named Hannah
Down in Louisiana
Oh, she's a mojo worker
She's gonna work that thing for me
She's gonna hear my misery
And I know he'll be coming on home soon
She gonna work it
She gonna work it out
Work your mojo, Hannah
Work your mojo
Work that thing for me
Work that thing for me
