I'm a rebel, soul rebel
I'm a capturer, soul adventurer
See the morning sun
On the hillside
If you're not living right
I beg ya travel wide
Said I'm a, said I'm a
Said I'm a living man
I got work to do
If you're not happy
Then you must be blue
Must be blue
I'm a rebel
Soul rebel
I'm a capturer
Soul adventurer
See the morning sun
On the hillside
If you're not living good
I beg ya travel wide
Said I'm a, said I'm a
Said I'm a living man
I got work to do
If you're not happy
Then you must be blue
Must be blue
I'm a rebel, let them talk
Soul rebel, talk won't bother me
I'm a rebel, did you hear what they said
Soul rebel, night and day
People say
I'm a rebel
Do you hear them lippy
Soul rebel
Did you hear them on the corner
Soul rebel, night and day, night and day
I'm a rebel, soul rebel
I'm a capturer
Soul adventurer
