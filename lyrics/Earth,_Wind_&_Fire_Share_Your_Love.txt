Love is the light, gonna let it shine
Living each day, you're sure to find
Another heart that's warm and true
Shining the light in return to you
Share your love, don't try to restrain it
Love, don't need to be afraid to
Love, everybody get together
Let every heart, 'round the world do its part
The voice of love, ringing loud and clear
To everyone with a listening ear
Hostage of hate and in chains of fear
Send Dr. Love, they will disappear
Share your love, don't try to restrain it
Love, don't need to be afraid to
Love, everybody get together
Let every heart, 'round the world do its part
You're number one, 'cause deep inside
Feelings still abide
You're number one, you light the way
Night becomes the day
You're number one, 'cause we feel it's true
Yes, inside we do (feel, feel, feel it's true)
You're number one
Share your love, don't try to restrain it
Love, don't need to be afraid to
Love, everybody get together
Let every heart, 'round the world do its part
