I know it happens almost every time
I also know that nothing last forever
So now you wanna go and change your mind
Forget about the time we spent together
Do you think that I'll shoot myself
When you tell me that it's over ?
You say you, had a change of heart
You better think it over, baby
Cause if you ever change your mind
I could have a change of heart the next time
You really know just how to put me off
You say one thing and then you do another
Now it takes more than that to get me off
You must think that you're a perfect lover
Do you think that I'll fall apart
When you tell me that you leavin' ?
You say you, had a change of heart
You better think it over, baby
Cause if you ever change your mind
I could have a change of heart the next time
Wonder what I'll do with all the time
When I'm not here, and I'm not on the telephone
No more worry 'bout if you do and I'll
Cause it won't matter anymore if I'm all alone
Baby I got news for you
It isn't gonna kill me
You say you, had a change of heart
You better think it over, baby
Cause if you ever change your mind
I could have a change of heart the next time
You say you, had a change of heart
You better think it over, baby
Hey, (hey)
Better think it over
Think it over baby
