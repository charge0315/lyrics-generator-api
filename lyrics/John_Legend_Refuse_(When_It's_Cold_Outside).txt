I pray for better days to come
I pray that I would see the sun
'Cause life is so burdensome
When everyday is a rainy one
But suddenly there's no more clouds
And I believe without a doubt
That heaven sent an angel down
Then she turned my life around

You know and I know
Friends come and friends go
Storms rise and winds blow
But one thing I know for sure

When it's cold outside
There's no need to worry 'cause
I'm so warm inside
You give me peace
When the storm's outside
'Cause we're in love I know
It'll be alright
Alright, it's alright
Oooh...

Now peace is so hard to find
We're terrorized and victimized
But that's when I close my eyes
And think of you to ease my mind
You take me to another place
There's no more war (no more war)
Just love and grace
Baby, you restore my faith
I know the struggle's not in vain

You know and I know
Through all the battles
Baghdad to Israel
There's one thing I know for sure

When it's cold outside
There's no need to worry 'cause
I'm so warm inside
You give me peace
When the storm's outside
'Cause we're in love I know
It'll be alright
Alright, it's alright
Oooh...
Alright it's alright
Alright it's alright
Alright it's alright
Oooh...

When it's cold outside
There's no need to worry 'cause
I'm so warm inside
You give me peace
When the storm's outside
'Cause we're in love I know
It'll be alright
Alright, it's alright
Oooh...
Oh it's gonna be alright
Ooh...

'Cause you give me peace
In the middle of the storm
When it's cold you're keeping me warm
It's alright
It's alright
I'm never gonna leave
You give me what I need
It's alright, it's alright
