Day or night, we can dance into the silence
Day or night, we can shine out loud
And I want to loose myself inside this feelin’
The kind of feelin’ that you get when the pain has gone
And I want to loose myself inside this feelin’
The kind of feelin’ that you get when you look into the sun
Look into the sun
Look into the sun
Look into the sun
Day or night, we can bloom into violets
Day or night, we can taste the rains
And I want to loose myself inside this feelin’
The kind of feelin’ that you get …
And I want to loose myself inside this feelin’
The kind of feelin’ that you get when you look into the sun
Look into the sun
Such a  good, good, good, good, good feeling
I lose my faith....
When I look into the, look into the sun
Sunlight
