This song goes out to all you fellas
Who think your kisses are as sweet as candy
But honey got you beat by a million miles!

Your kiss is sweet, as sweet as candy
But honey beat your kisses by a million miles (Yeah)
Your kiss is sweet, as sweet as candy
But honey beat your kisses by a million miles

You came and took my love and ran away
Leaving these eyes of mine crying every day (Yeah)
Now you're back and you are saying you want to stay
When you left, you stayed too long
Might as well keep moving on
And on and on and on and on and on

Your kiss is sweet, as sweet as candy
But honey beat your kisses by a million miles
Your kiss is sweet, as sweet as candy
But honey beat your kisses by a million miles

To you, my life was nothing but a game (Yeah)
Now you're here and don't want to take the blame
How could you take all this time and I could feel the same?
Sorry for the tears you cried (Me too)
There's another, I won't lie
Won't lie, won't lie, won't lie, won't lie, won't lie (You stupid boy)

Your kiss is sweet, as sweet as candy
But honey beat your kisses by a million miles
Your kiss is sweet, as sweet as candy
But honey beat your kisses by a million miles

Your kiss is sweet, as sweet as candy
But honey beat your kisses by a million miles
Your kiss is sweet, as sweet as candy
But honey beat your kisses by a million miles
Your kiss is sweet, as sweet as candy
But honey beat your kisses by a million miles
Hey, your kiss is sweet, ooh, as sweet as candy
But honey beat your kisses by a million miles
Yeah, your kiss is sweet, hey, sweet as candy

But honey beat your kisses by a million miles
(Beats them by a million miles
Beats them by a million miles
Your breath stinks!
Yours does too!)
