If you only knew how you linger
In my heart of hearts, there's a will
There's a will
Give me ha-ha, yeah
Say you love me
You know life can seem such a bitter pill
When you're alone
You lend your body and soul
Tryin' to get back in control
You give your all in the game
And though your mind may change
You know your heart remains the same
If you only knew how I suffer
When you do me out, I decline
I decline
Give me ha-ha, yeah
Say it matters
You know love can draw such a slender line
Ain't it the truth?
You lend your body and soul
Tryin' to get next to your role
Try, try
You give your all in the game
And though your mind may change
You know I love you just the same
Yeah, you lend your body and soul
Tryin' to get next to your role
Try, try
You give your all in the game
Though your mind may change
Listen to me, girl
You know your heart remains
Listen to me, girl
You know, mind may change
You know your heart remains
Listen to me, girl
You got to listen to me, girl
(Listen to me, girl)
You got to fa-la-la
(You got to fa-la-la)
You got to listen to me, girl
(Listen to me, girl)
You got to fa-la-la
(You got to fa-la-la)
You know your mind may change
Listen to me, girl
(Listen to me, girl)
Listen to me, girl
(Listen to me, girl)
You know your mind may change
You know your heart remains
(Listen to me, girl)
Whoa, whoa, whoa
(Listen to me, girl)
Whoa, whoa, whoa
(Listen to me, girl)
(Listen to me, girl)
You got to...
(Listen to me, girl)
(Listen to me, girl)
(Listen to me, girl)
(Listen to me, girl)
