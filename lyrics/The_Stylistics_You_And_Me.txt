Life seems to turn our poor heads all around
We've both seen all our hopes and dreams fall upside down
We've had our share of build-you-ups and put-me-downs
And watched the world from tearful eyes go underground

But it's just you and me
We're king and queen
Always runnin' full steam
For the same old dream
Always reaching for the sky
With a useful scheme
Baby, you and me

Someday we'll find out just what life's about
And that's when we'll find happiness without the doubts
Till then we'll take the blows and listen to their shouts
Together we can conquer all 'cause we found out

That it's just you and me
We're two of a kind
Same frame of mind
You and me
Two acorns descended right
From the same oak tree
Baby, you and me
Baby, you and me
Woh, ohh, you and me
(You and me)
(You and me)

You and me
We're two of a kind
Same frame of mind
You and me
Two acorns descended right
From the same oak tree
Baby, you and me
Baby, you and me

Oh, ohh, you and me
We're two of a kind
Same frame of mind
You and me
Two acorns descended right
From the same oak tree
Baby, you and me
Baby, you and me
Yeah, you and me
