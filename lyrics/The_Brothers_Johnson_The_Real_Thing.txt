So glad we've got a good thing
You know you make my heart sing
You are the real thing
You know you make my heart sing
I've longed to have this chance
With you, I feel romance
It's all for love and I want it bad
Seeing you, it's just a turn-on
And loving you, I want to hold on
There's a feelin' in my heart that just won't let you go
(Ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ah, hey)
I'll hold on, I'll keep on (I'm holding on)
I'll keep on, I'll hold on (I'm holding on)
I'll hold on, I'll keep on
I'll hold on to your love
So glad we've got a good thing
You know you make my heart sing
You are the real thing
You know you make my heart sing
So glad we've got a good thing
You know you make my heart sing
You are the real thing
You know you make my heart sing
Seeing you, it's just a turn-on
And loving you, I want to hold on
There's a feelin' in my heart that just won't let you go
(Ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ah, hey)
I'll hold on, I'll keep on (I'm holding on)
I'll keep on, I'll hold on (I'm holding on)
I'll hold on, I'll keep on
I'll hold on to your love
So glad we've got a good thing
You know you make my heart sing
You are the real thing
You know you make my heart sing
