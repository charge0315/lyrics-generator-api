So, if I brought you down, thank you very much for showing me where I'm at, I guess I don't really have that much more to do
And if you don't want me to continue, then I guess I won't
Thank you for showing me where I'm at
Yeah, that's better

We can start at the beginning, we can start at the end
We can do the things we want or be a part of the trend
So here I am, all alone, all afloat on a boat
In the middle of the ocean with no destination known
I got my tiki cup, I got my stash of rum
I got this silly brain of mine I know I have to numb
I let the stars above become my guide, enjoy the ride
I got my fishing rod, the wish of god is by my side
I got a compass, I have studied all the shifting tides
I got a notebook and the thoughts of mine that live inside
I have escaped the daily grind and getting paid for time
Time is never of the essence, I don't pay it mind
I follow daylight and the coming of the rising moon
Searching for my paradise, I hope to find it soon
But I have no need or no love for cartographers
I am a servant to the ocean, so I follow her

North, West, South, East
North, West, South, East
North, West, South, East
North, West, South

I used to be the type that would get seasick
I found that fighting it was not the way to treat it
In shallow waters, I can anchor down and have a swim
I learned when someone drowns it's probably from panicking
I'm trying to stay the course and stay away from shorelines
I like to be alone, be unconcerned with your shine
The sun it shines abundant, use it as a resource
Stock it up and use when you have a need for it
I put my letters in a bottle if you find one
Take it out and then replace it with some fine rum
Put it back to sea and hope that it gets back to me
Hope the story ends in such a fashion that it's happily
I put my eyes to rest tonight and listen to the waves
Red sky in the morning and I won't be saved
As the hurricane approaches, I have found some peace
This will be my final letter while I'm out to sea
