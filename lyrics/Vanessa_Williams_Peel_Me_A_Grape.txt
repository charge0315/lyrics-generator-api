Peel me a grape
Crush me some ice
Skin me a peach
Save the fuzz for my pillow
Spark me a smoke
Talk to me nice

You've got to wine me and dine me
Don't go try to fool me, bejewel me
Either amuse me or lose me
I'm getting hungry
Peel me a grape

Pop me a cork
French me a fry
Crack me a nut
Bring a bowl full of bon-bons
Chill me some wine
Keep standing by

Just entertain me
Champagne me
Show me that you love me
Keep lovin' me
There's one way to cheer me
Cashmere me
I'm getting hungry
Peel me a grape

Here's how to be an agreeable chap
Love me but leave me in luxury's lap
Hop when I holler, skip when I snap
When I say do it, jump to it

Send out for some scotch
Boil me a crab
Cut me a rose
Make some tea with the petals
Just hang around
Pick up the tab

Never out think me
Just mink me
Polar bear rug me
Don't bug me
New fund to bird me
You heard me
I'm getting hungry
Peel me a grape

Here's how to be an agreeable chap

Make some tea with the petals
Just hang around
Pick up the tab

Never out think me
Just mink me
Polar bear rug me
Don't bug me
New Thunderbird me
You heard me
I'm getting hungry
Peel me a grape
