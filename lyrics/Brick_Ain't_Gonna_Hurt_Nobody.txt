A groovy groove, nice and easy
Feels so good there in my bones
Dance, dance, dance to the music
Get down, get down and sing along

'Cause it ain't gonna hurt nobody to get on down
It ain't gonna hurt nobody to get on down
It ain't gonna hurt nobody to get on down
Don't stop me
And I won't stop you

Now someone said that it was ten to four
It's not too late to throw some more
Times keep ticking away
Come on and let's get down today

'Cause it ain't gonna hurt nobody to get on down
It ain't gonna hurt nobody to get on down
It ain't gonna hurt nobody to get on down
Don't stop me
And I won't stop you

It ain't gonna hurt nobody to get on down
It ain't gonna hurt nobody to get on down
It ain't gonna hurt nobody to get on down
Don't stop me
It ain't gonna hurt nobody to get on down
It ain't gonna hurt nobody to get on down
It ain't gonna hurt nobody to get on down
Don't stop me
And I won't stop you
