Boo ba doo da, la ya ba doo ya, ba ba doo da
Boo ba doo da, la ya ba da da, da da da da
Noo da doo da, la ya ba da ya

Easy, easy, take love easy
Never let your feelings show
Make it breezy, breezy, breezy
Easy come and easy go

Never smile too brightly, brightly
When your heart is riding high
Let your heart break oh so slightly
When your baby says goodbye

That well-known flame is mighty hot
As all of us have learned
So handle it with velvet gloves
And you won't get your fingers burned

Oh, take love easy, easy, easy
On the free and easy plan
And if you can't take it easy
Take it easy as you can

That well-known flame is mighty hot
As all of us have learned
So handle it with velvet gloves
And you won't get your fingers burned

Oh, take love easy, easy, easy
On the free and easy plan
And if you can't take it easy
Take it easy as you can
Oh, take love easy as you can
Yes, take love easy, easy as you can

Doo da doo da, la ya ba doh ya
Boh boh doh boh boh doh doh boo da
