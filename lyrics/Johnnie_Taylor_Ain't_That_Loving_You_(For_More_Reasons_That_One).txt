You think I love you
For just one thing
To you my love this may
Be the way that it seems
But I love the way, that you carry yourself
I even love you, love you, love you, love you
The way you wear your hair
Ain't that loving you
Ain't that loving you
For more reasons than one
Somehow, my love
You've been misled
By the things that
That other guys have said
Well, I love you, for what you are
I even love you
For what you may become
Ain't that loving you
Ain't that loving you
For more reasons than one
Did it ever occur to you
Why I do all that a man can do?
To keep that smile on your face
It's because I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you
In, uh, so many ways
Somehow, my love
You've been misled
By the things that
That other guys have said
But I love you, for what you are
I even love you
For what you may become
Ain't that loving you (Oh oh)
Ain't that loving you (Baby)
Ain't that loving you (Ain't that loving you, girl, yeah)
Ain't that loving you (Ain't that loving you, yeah, yeah)
Ain't that loving you (You and you and you and you and you)
Ain't that loving you (Let me say that one more time)
Ain't that loving you (You, you, you)
Ain't that loving you (My good love, my good love)
Ain't that loving you
