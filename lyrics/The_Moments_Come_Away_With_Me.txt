Come away with me girl to my private world
We can have happiness and peaceful ever more
We can be two lovers doing our own thing
You can be my queen and I'll be the king

Come away with me
Where we can be free
Come away with me
You'll never regret it
A day of you life

It can be so beautiful it will be like paradise
You and me together our life can be so bright
I've hoped and prayed every day and night
My wishful dream came true
Now you finally come my way
Don't break my heart in two

Come away with me
Where we can be free
Come away with me
You'll never regret it
A day of you life
Come away with me
Where we can be free
Come away with me
You'll never regret it
A day of your life

Come away, come away, come away
Far away with me
Far away, come away
Far, come away, come away
