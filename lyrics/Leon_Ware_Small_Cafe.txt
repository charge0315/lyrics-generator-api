Small café
Quiet on a summer's afternoon
Two lonely souls begin to move
Eye to eye
Searching for the reasons why
Could this be another passing by?
Should we try?

Dreams held within a time
Waiting for the line
It be yours or mine
Don't be afraid
Holding someone close
Wanting hurts the most
It ain't wrong to me
For love comes in many ways
On a summer's afternoon
In a small café

La, la, la
La-la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la

Dreams, dreams that could entwine
Our meetings of the mind
Once upon a time
Don't look away
Just hold me with your eyes
Melting your soul
Look you can't disguise
For love comes in so many different ways
On a summer's afternoon
In a small café

Yeah, in a small café
Mhm, in a small café
