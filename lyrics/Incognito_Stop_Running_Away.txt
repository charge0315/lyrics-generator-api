Stop running away, stop running away
Hey child don’t be afraid of showing what you feel
Stop running away, stop running away
Hey child don’t be afraid of showing what you feel
Cut away your pride, and show the world that you’re real
Say, why push and shove and kill the love
What’s going on inside, ‘cos it’s keeping you, it’s keeping you
It’s keeping you from being loved, being loved
These tears of rage can be replaced
A new born age be in its place
If you’re willing to face, face the truth now
The answers are within you
Like posters on the subway walls
They’re looking right back, looking right back at you now
They’re echoed in mirrors in endless halls
Larger than life you’re staring at yourself
Hey tell me if you had the chance, if you had the chance to be any other place other than here
Please tell me where we should go now
Oh it’s a new start, it’s a new day
All you’ve got to do is to choose
Where will you go, where will you go, where do you go from here
It’s all there, it’s all there right before you
Time to escape your future lies
