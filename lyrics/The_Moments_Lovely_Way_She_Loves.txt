When she holds me in her arms
I can feel the magic of her charm
When she kisses me oh so tenderly
Makes me know her love is for only me

It's such a lovely way she loves (Haha, baby)
It's such a lovely way she loves (Haha, baby)

When I'm feeling bad, you know she eases the pain
When I'm down and out, ooh baby, you make me feel alive again
She makes me know her love is for me
And it's for real, not a fantasy

It's such a lovely way she loves (Haha, baby)
It's such a lovely way she loves (Haha, baby)

I remember in the summer sunset
We sat and talked about how we had met
And when the autumn leaves began to fall
I remembered how we sat and reminisced it all
And when the wintry winds began to blow
I held him close, and that made me know
That made me know, that made me know, ooh (Oh)

Such a lovely way she loves (Haha, baby)
It's such a lovely way she loves (Haha, baby)
It's such a lovely way she loves (Haha, baby)
