To write a book, I know
You must imagine
Things that aren't so
I played with the idea
Your half didn't go
I rewrote the script
Why let the world know
I couldn't write a sad tragedy
I hope you don't mind too much
It just wasn't in me, you see
I like happy endings
Never, no tears, ooh, ooh, baby
I like new beginnings
Hopes and no fears
To write a book it seems
You must know how
To paint a dream
Like high on a hill
Or once upon a time
Somehow the truth
Don't always rhyme
So call it fiction, fantasy or fact
My only prediction was
You'd be back, you see
I like happy endings
Never, no tears, ohh, ohh, baby
I like new beginnings
Hopes and no fears
I gotta change every line
I like happy endings
Never, no tears
I don't believe in, baby
I don't believe in it
I like new beginnings
Hopes and no fears, ooh
I remember bedtime stories
Often told to me
Dragonflies, giant butterflies
Through the night would creep
I just couldn't get to sleep
They always made me cry
Maybe that's the reason why
I like happy endings
Never, no tears, ohh, baby
Hope you don't mind
But I changed every line
I like new beginnings
Hopes and no fears, no fears
I don't believe in 'em
I like happy endings
Never, no tears
'Cause I remember
How it used to be
Just you and me
I like new beginnings
Hopes and no fears, no fears, no
I had tell it, tell it alright
I like happy endings
Never, no tears, no, no
The suns going to shine another day
I like new beginnings
