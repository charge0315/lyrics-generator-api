Once I believed in Cassandra
A psychic whose words were profound
She built my hopes up with prospects of love
But love did not come around
Then I put faith in Aurora
Her reputation was sound
Now I'm here wondering where my money went
The crystal ball let me down

In my daydreams
I fall in love
My search is through
They're just daydreams
Prophets say will soon come true

Where is love
Where is the mystery girl
I've always dreamed of
Where is love
Someone somewhere has an answer
Tell me where is love

Can't help but think of Aladdin
A myth only children believe
Maybe his lamp has the power enough
To send a lover to me

In my daydreams
I fall in love
My search is through
They're just daydreams
Prophets say will soon come true

Where is love
Where is the mystery girl
I've always dreamed of
Where is love
Someone somewhere has an answer
Tell me where is love

 X2
Where is love
Where is the mystery girl
I've always dreamed of
Where is love
Someone somewhere has an answer
Tell me where is love
