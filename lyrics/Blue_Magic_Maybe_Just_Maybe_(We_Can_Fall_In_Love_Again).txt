Puzzles and tricks and little kids games
Checkers and chess and other quiz games
Guess what and when and how and guess who
You don't know what i said I'll bet you
I know you're trying to tell me, our love is all over
But maybe just maybe just maybe we can
Fall in love again
Why don't you see yourself and wake up
Be big enough to kiss and make up
Why should we try to bluff and fake it?
Let's grow up and try and make it
Let's throw away the child's play, no more silly games
But maybe just maybe just maybe we can
Fall in love again
We're acting just like children, let's talk it over
And maybe just maybe just maybe we can, fall on love again
Maybe just maybe just maybe we can
Fall in love again
