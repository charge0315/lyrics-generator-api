My life is a mess
Just like everybody elses
I guess
Not enough time
And too much stress
I'm neglecting you
I'm not saying
I don't worry at all
There are times and moments
To cure my soul
Sit back and relax
It's gonna be alright
I know we can
Sort this out
It's just a matter of time
Baby can't you see
The look on my face
Won't you give me a try
I know we can
Work it out
It's just a matter of time
Baby won't you say
You'll stay and
Kiss me one more time
Life is a test
It can be tough but
I'm doing my best
It takes some time
And alot of stress
But i'm finding my way
I'm not saying
You learn all along
There is always someone
To tell you it's wrong
But i'm talking too much
Get back to real life
I know we can
Sort this out
It's just a matter of time
Baby can't you see
The look on my face
Won't you give me a try
I know we can
Work it out
It's just a matter of time
Baby won't you say
You'll stay and
Kiss me one more time
Say the word
And i'll be there
(so don't you worry now)
Just say the word
And i'll be there
(so don't you worry now) x3
I'm not saying
I don't worry at all
There are times and moments
To cure my soul
Just sit back and relax
It's gonna be alright
I know we can
Sort this out
It's just a matter of time
Baby can't you see
The look on my face
Won't you give me a try
I know we can
Work it out
It's just a matter of time
Baby won't you say
You'll stay and
Kiss me one more time
Just say the word woo
And i'll be there
(so don't you worry now) x4
