A popularity of invasion
Handed down through centuries
A force of arms called gentle persuasion
What have we learned from history
Apparently nothing
Chorus:
Apparently nothing
Nothing apparently
Apparently nothing
Nothing apparently
Apparently nothing
Nothing apparently
Apparently nothing
Nothing apparently
Human worth is so inexpensive
Compared to gold, the root of most wars
Subtract the tears from countless offences
What is left but guns and scars
Apparently nothing
Chorus
Well as for me I'm gonna keep loving
'Cause it's the only sane thing to do
'Cause I'm not into pushin' and shovin'
No confrontation, what have you
Apparently nothing
Chorus
Yeah, yeah
I ain't trying to rule your mind
A conscious observer trying to find
A place on Earth where they heed the signs
Beware of conflicts that ruin unkind
If you want things move better
Withstand the tides of the bad weather
The struggle thrives when we all gather
Down at the bank of the soul river
Yeah
A baby is crying
A mother is dying
A leader is swearing
But no one is caring... about
Apparently nothing
Chorus
See the light
See the light
See the light
