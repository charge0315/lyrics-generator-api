Everybody grab the highest star
Makes no difference who or what you are
And every song he hears is another lullaby
The dog is barking and the sheets are cold
Even the guy out on the street, he knows
Love can make or break a heart of any soul
There's no way I'm gonna make it
No way I'm gonna win
I can almost see the sad goodbyes
Now what should I do
I'm losing myself in you
There's a palace in the south of France
Where only the lonely people learn to dance
Leave 'em laughing if you got half a chance
Memories make you watch and never are
Find your heaven in the corner bar
The music makes you dream
You're not so far from home
There's no way I'm gonna make it
No way I'm gonna win
I can almost see the sad goodbyes
Now what should I do
I'm losing myself in you
Now no one else could ever do
What you do when you're doing
No, there's nothing to it
No, there's nothing to it
There's no way I'm gonna
There's no way I can
I can almost see the sad goodbyes
Now what should I do
I'm losing, losing, losing
I'm losing myself
Never gonna make it
Never gonna win, never
Never gonna make it
Never gonna win, never
Never gonna make it
Never gonna win, never
