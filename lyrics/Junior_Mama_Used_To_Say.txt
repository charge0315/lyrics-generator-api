Ooh, yeah girl

Said a small boy once asked
"When will I grow up?
When will I see what grown-ups do see?"
In his fight to come of age, he would act an older age
To be recognized as one, and not a mass

And mama used to say "Take your time, young man!"
And mama used to say "Don't you rush to get old!"
And mama used to say "Take it in your stride!"
And mama used to say "Live your life!"

As the years went rushing by, he would cut down on his age
He would tell his girl of how it used to be
How his mommy passed away, but these lines she would say
And at the time, he couldn't understand

And mama used to say "Take your time, young man!"
And mama used to say "Don't you rush to get old!"
And mama used to say "Take it in your stride!"
And mama used to say "Live your life!"

You're young, so enjoy
Don't hold on back, do all you want to do
Now is the time for you to stride
For you to get better in what you are doing

Said a small boy once asked
"When will I grow up?
When will I see what grown-ups do see?"
In his fight to come of age, he would act an older age
To be recognized as one, and not a mass

And mama used to say "Take your time, young man!"
And mama used to say "Don't you rush to get old!"
And mama used to say "Take it in your stride!"
And mama used to say "Live your life!"
"Live your life!"
"Live your life!" (Ooh)
And mama used to say "Take your time, young man!"
And mama used to say "Don't you rush to get old!"
And mama used to say "Take it in your stride!"

Mama used to say
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Ooh, ooh
Mama used to say, ooh
Mama used to say, ooh
Mama used to say, ooh
Mama used to say
