You walked with me, footprints in the sand
And helped me understand where I'm going
You walked with me when I was all alone
With so much unknown along the way

Then I heard you say

"I promise you, I'm always there
When your heart is filled with sorrow and despair
I'll carry you when you need a friend
You'll find my footprints in the sand"

I see my life flash across the sky
So many times have I been so afraid
And just when I… I thought I'd lost my way
You gave me strength to carry on

That's when I heard you say

"I promise you, I'm always there
When your heart is filled with sorrow and despair
And I'll carry you when you need a friend
You'll find my footprints in the sand"

When I'm weary
Well, I know you'll be there
And I can feel you when you say

"I promise you
I'm always there
When your heart is filled with sadness and despair (And despair)
I'll carry you when you need a friend (Need a friend)
You'll find my footprints in the sand
(I promise you, I'm always there)
When your heart is full of sadness and despair (And despair)
I'll carry you when you need a friend
You'll find my footprints in the sand"
