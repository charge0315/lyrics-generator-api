Everything, everything
Everything, everything
I'm invisible and a razor of love
Why don't you call me? I feel like flying in too
And a razor of love
Why don't you call me? I feel like flying in too
And a razor of love, and a razor of love
I scream, I scream, I scream, I scream
I scream, I scream, I scream, I scream
I scream, I scream, I scream so much
You know what I mean
This electric stream and my tears in league
With the wires and energy
It's my machine, this is my beautiful dream
I'm hurting no one, hurting no one
Hurting no one, I'm hurting no one
I want to give you everything
I want to give you energy
Want to give a good thing
To give you everything
Everything, everything
Everything, everything
Everything, everything
Everything, everything
Everything, everything
One final scream of love
Who couldn't climb this high
She looks beautiful like a child
A feel of tears and I want to scream
You know what I mean
This is hurting no one
And a razor of love
Let go, let go
Let go, let go
Let go, let go
Let go, let go
