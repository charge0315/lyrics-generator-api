Tonight's the night (tonight is the night)

Woke up late, jumped out of bed
Into the rain, yeah
Need a break for my head
Clear my brain
My car was stolen, my baby too
I been lookin' 'round
I'm feelin' cold, and I know what to do
Yes indeed, I'm gonna get down

Tonight's the night (tonight is the night)
Have a good time (have a good time)
Tonight's the night (tonight is the night)
Have a good time (have a good time)
Have a good time...

Workin' all day, you owe it to yourself
To ease your mind
Before you play, put the rules upon the shelf
'Cause you're gonna find
It's a natural high when you're dancin'
And feelin' free
Got to take some time for romancin'
Have some birds and bees

Tonight's the night (tonight is the night)
Have a good time (have a good time)
Tonight's the night (tonight is the night)
Have a good time (have a good time)
Tonight's the night (tonight is the night)
Have a good time (have a good time)
Tonight's the night (tonight is the night)
Have a good time (have a good time...)
Have a good time...

Aaaah, haha-haha-haha-haha!
Yeah...!

Tonight's the night (tonight is the night)
Have a good time (have a good time)
Tonight's the night (tonight is the night)
Have a good time (have a good time)
Tonight's the night (tonight is the night)
Have a good time (have a good time)
Tonight's the night (tonight is the night)
Have a good time (have a good time)
Tonight's the night (tonight is the night)
Have a good time (have a good time)
Tonight's the night (tonight is the night)
Have a good time (have a good time)
Tonight's the night (tonight is the night)
Have a good time (have a good time)
Tonight's the night (tonight is the night)
Have a good time (have a good time)
Tonight's the night (tonight is the night)
