Here it is, she picked it off
In the garden just for me
I can have it now
Or save it for later

Wanna trust her but the head on my shoulders
Cannot tell what's good from bad
I'm pretty sure I could use it
But I don't need another burden to carry

Darling I don't want to let you down
But I can't play the game with your rules
Deep down I know I will mess it up
Spend the rest of my days with those blues

Darling I know you want it as much
As much as I want it too
Darling I know for sure
Pick up the pieces

Asked me to follow her
To a place where we can hide
It's not even begun and it could be fun
But I'm looking for a way out

On the slippery slope but there's still hope
I'll get out of here alive
"Sorry, babe, I gotta go"
I'm afraid I never ever learned to say no

Darling I don't want to let you down
But I can't play the game with your rules
Deep down I know I will mess it up
Spend the rest of my days with those blues

Darling I know you want it as much
As much as I want it too
Darling I know for sure
Pick up the pieces

You follow traces, see many faces
Give a few kisses, pick up the pieces
You follow traces, see many faces
Get a few kisses, pick up the pieces

Darling I don't want to let you down
But I can't play the game with your rules
Deep down I know I will mess it up
Spend the rest of my days with those blues

Darling I know you want it as much
As much as I want it too
Darling I know for sure
Pick up the pieces
(x3)
Darling I love you
Pick up the pieces
