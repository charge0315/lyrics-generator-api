You wake up in the morning with a smile
Greet the day
Open up the windows wide
To let the sunshine through
It kisses your hair that smells of lemon lime
Caresses your cheeks of rose
And your clear eyes of blue
I love my salad girl, salad girl, salad girl
Salad girl, salad girl, I love you!
You muss up your hair
And wrinkle up your nose
With twinkling, laughing eyes
You say hello to me
Fresh, clean and sweet so simple, so natural
You're everything
I dreamed a girl could ever be
I love my salad girl, salad girl, salad girl
Salad girl, salad girl, I love you!
Oh yеs my salad girl, salad girl, salad girl
Salad girl, salad girl, I love you!
