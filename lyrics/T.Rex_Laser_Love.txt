Yeah!
Yeah, ah, yeah

Gold mouth lady mix a drink for me
Lay beside me, solid company

You move on up, you move on back
Your laser love is like a heart attack

Yeah!
Yeah, ah, yeah

Lean clean woman lay a kiss on me
My love is so strong like a raging sea

You move on up, you move on back
Your laser love is like a heart attack

Yeah!
Yeah, ah, yeah

Dance, dance, dance, till the crack of dawn
Dance, dance, dance, till your shoes are worn

You move on up, you move on back
Your laser love is like a heart attack
You move on up, you move on back
Your laser love is like a heart attack
Yeah!
