What am I bid for this beautiful love
A love long ago that was mine
What will you give for this genuine dream?
A dream that has faded with time
Once I believed she was safe in my heart
Though I valued her love it was wrong from the start
So what am I bid for this beautiful love that just couldn't be
What am I bid for this pure work of art that's no good to me
Surely there's someone to take her away and let me be free
I tried many times but I know I can't carry on
All I want for this beautiful love
Is freedom to find peacе of mind
Though there werе times when I loved her so much
In faith I was totally blind
What can you do when your dreams fall apart
How can you fight what you feel in your heart
So what am I bid for this beautiful love that just couldn't be
What am I bid for this pure work of art, which is no good to me
Surely there's someone to take her away and let me be free
I tried many times but I know I can't carry on
So what am I bid for this beautiful love that just couldn't be
What am I bid for this pure work of art, which is no good to me
Surely there's someone to take her away and let me be free
I tried many times but I know I can't carry on
My love is going, going, gone
