But it’s a long, long, while
From May to December
And the days grow short
When you reach September
And the Autumn weather
Turns the leaves to flame
And I haven’t got time for the waiting game
For the days dwindle down to a precious few
September! November!
And these few precious days
I’d spend with you
These golden days I’d spend with you
For the days dwindle down to a precious few
September! November!
And these few precious days, I’ll spend with you
These golden days I spend with you
