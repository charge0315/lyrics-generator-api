I used to hurry a lot, I used to worry a lot
I used to stay out 'til the break of day
Oh, that didn't get it, it was high time I quit it
I just couldn't carry on that way

Oh, I did some damage
I know it's true
Didn't know I was so lonely
'Til I found you

You can go the distance, we'll find out
In the long run (In the long run)
We can handle some resistance if our love
Is a strong one (Is a strong one)

People talking about us
They got nothin' else to do
When it all comes down
We will still come through

In the long run
Ooh, I want to tell you
It's a long run

You know I don't understand why you don't treat yourself better
Do the crazy things that you do
Cause all the debutantes in Houston, baby
Couldn't hold a candle to you

Did you do it for love?
Did you do it for money?
Did you do it for spite?
Did you think you had to, honey?

Who is gonna make it? We'll find out
In the long run (In the long run)
I know we can take it if our love
Is a strong one (Is a strong one)

Well, we're scared
But we ain't shakin'
Kinda bent
But we ain't breakin'

In the long run
Ooh, I want to tell you
It's a long run, eh, eh-eh
In the long run, ooh, ahh, ehh
In the long run

Gonna find out, ooh fi-fi-fi-find out
Long, long, long, long, long, long, long
Ooh, run-run-run, baby, run-run, baby
Long, long, long, long
