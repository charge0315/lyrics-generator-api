I saw a dream
That the world's disappeared
I thought I'd be
Breaking down every rule
I saw a dream
That the world's in a scheme
I thought I'd be
Hiding out every clue
Here I am
Watching all people's laughter
Here I am
Watching those people
I'm in love with a ghost
It's a beautiful thing in the world
I'm in love with a ghost
Such a beautiful thing in the world
I saw a dream
That the world's disappeared
I thought I'd be
Breaking down every rule
I saw a dream
That the world's in a scheme
I thought I'd be
Hiding out every clue
Here I am
Watching all people's laughter
Here I am
Watching those people
I'm in love with a ghost
It's a beautiful thing in the world
I'm in love with a ghost
Such a beautiful thing in the world
I'm in love with a ghost
