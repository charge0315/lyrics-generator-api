You took a piece of me when you left
I know you thought that i would forget the moments the silence the heart ache
And know i have this half a heart in my hand
The other half is buried in your sand
The bitter, the beautiful, the heartbreak
Am I even alive to you or just a shadow in the light of you?
I tried to get you out my system
I lied when i said i didn’t miss you
My mind is pulling apart but it can’t convince this half of my heart
And I’ve been trying to erase you
And I’ve, I’ve been dying to replace you
But time won’t let me restart your the only piece that fits this half of my heart
This room it echoes with memories of you
This world we built i guess you just outgrew
You moved on your long gone I’m still holding on
Sick and tired of always saying that I’m ok
Pretending when its written on my face
I’m shattered and I’m battered it don’t matter to you
Am I even alive to you or just a shadow in the light of you?
I tried to get you out my system
I lied when i said i didn’t miss you
My mind is pulling apart but i can’t convince this half of my heart
And I’ve  been trying to erase you
And I’ve, I’ve been dying to replace you
But time won’t let me restart now the sweetest dreams have fallen apart
Your the only piece that fits, the only piece that fits
This half of my heart
