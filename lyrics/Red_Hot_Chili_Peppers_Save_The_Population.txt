History's so strong
History's so strong
History's so strong
History's so strong
Sing another drinking song, the honky tonk will do
Making another breaking bone your favorite ingenue
This, the distant dawn
This, the distant dawn

I put my cards upon the table
I do this because I am able
One pixie's broken-down devotion
I threw my pistol in the ocean
Eyes wide with revelation
Shine at the police station
And when the verdict comes round
I'm sure that you will go down

Stay all night, we save the population
Stay all night, we save the population
Stay all night, we save the population
Stay all night, we save the population

Pistol and its pawn
Sailing through the lexicon
A pistol and its pawn
Blood on borderlines be drawn
Take another bottle down, the brothel and the shrew
Make another awful sound to rap the Gothic through
History's so strong
History's so strong

I put my cards upon the table
I do this because I am able
One pixie's broken-down devotion
I threw my pistol in the ocean
Eyes wide with revelation
Shine at the police station
And when the verdict comes round
I'm sure that you will go down

Stay all night, we save the population
(Stay all night, we save the population)
Stay all night, we save the population
(Stay all night, we save the population)
Stay all night, we save the population
(Stay all night, we save the population)
(Stay all night, we save the population)
Stay all night, we save the population
(Stay all night, we save the population)
(Stay all night, we save the population)
Stay all night, we save the population
(Stay all night, we save the population)
(Stay all night, we save the population)
Stay all night, we save the population
(Stay all night, we save the population)
(Stay all night, we save the population)
Stay all night, we save the population
(Stay all night, we save the population)
(Stay all night, we save the population)
Stay all night, we save the population
(Stay all night, we save the population)
(Stay all night, we save the population)
