Fascinating rhythm
You've got me on the go
Fascinating rhythm
I'm all a-quiver
What a mess you're making
The neighbors wanna know
Why I'm always shaking
Just like a fliver

Each morning I get up with the sun
With the sun
To find at night no work has been done

I know that
Once it didn't matter
But now you're doing wrong
When you start to patter
I'm so unhappy
Won't you take a day off?
Decide to run along
Somewhere far away off
And make it snappy
Oh, how I long to be the girl I used to be
Fascinating rhythm
Oh, won't you stop picking on me?
