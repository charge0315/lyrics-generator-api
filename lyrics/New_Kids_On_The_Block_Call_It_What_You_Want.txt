Call it what you want
Yeah

I can tell you’ve been watching me
Girl, I’ve been watching you too
I got the feeling you want my love
I must admit, I want your love too

Call it what you want, baby
Girl, I call it love
Call it what you want, darling
I’ll still call it love

You know there’s something about you, girl
What it is, is kinda hard to say
I only wish we could get away
Give me love, and I’ll lead the way

Call it what you want, baby
Girl I call it love
Call it what you want, darling
I’ll still call it love

Na na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na na
It’s so groovy
Just to be with you
It’s so moving
Just to dance
Or anything that you wanna do
Na na na na na na na na na
(You sing)
Na na na na na na na na na

I can feel it
I can feel it
I can feel it
I can feel your love, girl

It’s so groovy
Just to be with you
It’s so moving
Just to dance
Or anything that you wanna do

Call it what you want
I’ll still call it love
Call it anything that you wanna, girl
I’ll still call it love

You can call it this
You can call it that
You can call it anything, girl

Call it what you want, baby
Girl, I’ll call it love
Call it what you want, darling
I’ll still call it love
Call it what you want, baby
Girl, I’ll call it love
Call it what you want, darling
I’ll still call it love
