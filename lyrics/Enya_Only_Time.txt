Who can say where the road goes?
Where the day flows?
Only time
And who can say if your love grows
As your heart chose?
Only time

Ee-da de-e
Ee-da de-e
Ee da de
Ee da de-he do de
Do a de
Ee da de-he-e do de

Who can say why your heart sighs
As your love flies?
Only time
And who can say why your heart cries
When your love lies?
Only time

Ee-da de-e (ee-da de-e)
Ee-da de-e
Ee da de
Ee da de-he do de
Do a de (do a de)
Ee da de-he-e do de

Who can say when the roads meet?
That love might be in your heart?
And who can say when the day sleeps
If the night keeps all your heart?
Night keeps all your heart

Ee da de a-de
Ee da de a-de
Ee da de a-de
Ee da de a-de ah

Who can say if your love grows
As your heart chose?
Only time
And who can say where the road goes?
Where the day flows?
Only time

Who knows? Only time
Who knows? Only time
