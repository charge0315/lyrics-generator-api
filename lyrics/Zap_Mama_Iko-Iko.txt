Hey now!
Hey now!
Hey now! (x2)
Hey mister, see that sister
Don't you let her thrill you
Sticks and stones may break your bones
But man, her looks could kill you
Ho, ho
Hey, come my way
Azucar azucar mama
Come a come a nay sa le a le
With a azucar azucar mama
(Group):
Hey now!
Hey now!
Hey now! (x2)
Hey brother, there's another
Azucar mama turnin'
The sun will rise and blind your eyes
The fire keeps on burnin'
Ho, ho
(Chorus):
Hey, (hey now) come my way
Azucar azucar mama
Come a come a nay sa le a le
With a azucar azucar mama
(Chorus repeat)
(Group):
Hey now!
Hey now!
Hey now! (x2)
Hey, hey now, come on play now
Buy me 'smile' that's packin'
Better get it while you can
While the azucar mama's shakin'
Ho, ho
(Chorus X 2)
(Group):
Hey now!
Hey now!
Hey now! (x2)
(mouth voices and shouting/longing)
(Group):
Hey now!
Hey now!
Hey now!
Hey now!
Hey now!
If your baby, makes you crazy
Don't know where she's goin'
Eyes so messed up that they look
Which way the wind is blowin'
Ho, ho
(Chorus X 2)
Azucar, oh me!
Azucar, oh me! Azucar, oh my!
Azucar oh my! Come my way! (x4)
(Chorus X 2)
