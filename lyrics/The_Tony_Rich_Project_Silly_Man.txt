So you feel that I'll leave you
That I'll change my mind and walk away
But I found you, so I'll bake you a chocolate cake
Do you know that I love you
By the way I look into your mind?
I surrender my heart with a teary eye, yeah

Take your hands and place them all around my ears, oh
Take my heart and hook it up to your face, well
We're as one, you and me, a silly man

So my dear, please forgive me
For the situation that I'm in
'Cause I promise that it's over, it's in the wind, mmm, oh
Reach for me (Reach for me) and I'll catch you (And I'll catch you)
You can have wings as long as I'm with you
(Don't fly away) Don't fly away, not away, at least not alone, yeah, yeah-ah

When we fly high, we fly higher than the highest kite, yeah, huh
Over mountains where non-believers in disguise hide, yeah
We're so silly, (Ha ha ha) makin' faces just to make a smile, yeah, ain't no doubt about it baby
Like no others, you and me, a silly man, yeah, yeah

Take my heart and use it
I want to keep you, I want to love you (Want to love you)
I'll be more than consistent
I'll make it better if you will never
Never leave me, ooh

So, we're friends, and we made a special commitment, well, I
So, now we're lovers, and we vowed to never let it end, yeah, aye-ee, ah-ah
So we love each other, so we make love like instruments, ah, jiga-oh, said
Now, under covers, we listen to a silly man
