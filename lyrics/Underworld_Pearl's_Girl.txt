Rioja Rioja, Reverend Al Green
Deep blue Morocco
The water on stone
The water on concrete
The water on sand
The water on fire, smoke
The wind the salt
The bride boat coming
Dave and the water old man
Einstein on top of his house white
Deep blue Andalusia
Red yellow, red yellow black
Car red light bar black lace walls
Blue chair Morocco, Hamburg, Paris
The pieces of the puzzle are waiting
The water of the dark boats
Gliding the bride boat gone out to sea and
Dave is floating, Dave is floating
And old man Einstein, crazy in his attic

White room, sun room, shadow room
Night transmitting cars across the room
These things sent to dance across the room
I'm watching from your bed returning to you
