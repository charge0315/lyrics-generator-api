Hey (Hey)
Everybody (Everybody)
All around the world
Every boy and girl
Take a lesson from me
Do the stupidity
WOAH, oh!
My Mama
She says it's silly
My Papa
Says "you look like a fool"
Baby
I don't mind criticism
Because we're doin it
Every day in school
Come along with me
See how much
Fun it can be
While watchin' me
Oh, baby do the stupidity
Ohhh, My Mama
She says it's silly
My Papa
Says I look like a fool
But
I don't mind the criticism
Because we do it
Every day in school
Come along with me
See how much fun it can be
Watch it on T.V
(No, Baby) That's a stupidity
You make me feel so good...
Hahaha; Like I know I should...
Baaaaby...
