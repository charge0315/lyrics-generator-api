Those who are dead are not dead
They're just livin' in my head
And since I fell for that spell
I am livin' there as well, oh-oh

Time is so short, and I'm sure
There must be somethin' more

Those who are dead are not dead
They're just livin' in my head, oh-oh-oh-oh
And since I fell for that spell
I am livin' there as well, oh-oh-oh-oh

Time is so short, and I'm sure
There must be somethin' more
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh

You thought you might be a ghost
You thought you might be a ghost
You didn't get to heaven, but you made it close
You didn't get to heaven, but you made it close
You thought you might be a ghost
You thought you might be a ghost
You didn't get to heaven, but you made it close
You didn't get to heaven, but you oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh

Those who are dead are not dead
They're just livin' in my head, ooh
