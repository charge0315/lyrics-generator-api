(Oh!)

Can it be I stayed away too long?
Did I leave your mind when I was gone?
It's not my thing trying to get back
But this time, let me tell you where I'm at
You don't have to worry 'cause I'm coming (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
Back to where I should have always stayed (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
And now, I've learned the meaning to your story (Ooh-ooh)
And it's enough love for me to stay
Can it be I stayed away too long?
Did I leave your mind when I was gone?
Well, it's not my thing trying to get back
But this time, let me tell you where I'm at

I wanna, wanna be where you are, oh-oh
Anywhere you are, oh-oh
I wanna, wanna be where you are, oh-oh
Everywhere you are, oh

Please don't close the door to our future (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
There's so many things we haven't tried (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
I will love you better than I used to (Ooh-ooh)
And give you all the love I have inside

(Oh!)

I wanna, wanna be where you are, oh-oh
Any, any, anywhere you are, oh-oh
I wanna, wanna be where you are, oh-oh
I gotta, gotta be where you are, oh-oh

I wanna be, I wanna be, oh
Yeah, yeah, baby, now
I wanna be, I wanna be, oh
Ooh, I wanna be, I wanna be, oh
Na-na, yeah-yeah
I wanna be, I wanna be, oh
I wanna be, I wanna be, oh
Na-na, baby
I wanna be, I wanna be, oh
I wanna be, I wanna be, oh
Ooh-ooh, baby
