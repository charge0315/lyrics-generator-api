Zoo
The human zoo
We're free

As a caged chimpanzee
Right
Or really wrong
Disguised in life
As human right
And they calls us a civilization
We're treated like animals outside our cages
If people see that you're tryin'
They tear you up like hungry lion

Inside the zoo
The human zoo
What can I do
It's gonna prove

Just give your friend a break
He'll bite the hand that feeds him like a rattlesnake
And don't shut your eyes and try to sleep
Otherwise another dog will steal your meat

Inside the zoo
The human zoo
What can I do
It's gonna prove

Zoo
The human zoo
We're free
As a caged chimpanzee
I don't like to get down on their level
I bet it's your turn, I know it's terrible
It's true

The human zoo, now
Not like they do, no
I will prove
For me and you, girl
That inside of you
I love you too
I want you to
In this human zoo, lord I'm comin'
Uh huh, in this human zoo
I'm gonna do this for me and you
Oh, I want you too
