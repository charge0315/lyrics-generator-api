Beautiful love, you are all mystery
Beautiful love, what have you done to me?
I was contented 'til you came along
Thrilling my soul with your song
Beautiful love, I've roamed your paradise
Searching for love, my dreams to realize
Reaching for heaven, depending on you
Beautiful love, will my dreams come true?
Beautiful love, you are all mystery
Beautiful love, what have you done to me?
I was contented 'til you came along
Thrilling my soul with your song
Beautiful love, I've roamed your paradise
Searching for love, my dreams to realize
Reaching for heaven, depending on you
Beautiful love, will my dreams come true?

Beautiful love, you are all mystery

Thrilling my soul with your song
Beautiful love, I've roamed your paradise
Searching for love, my dreams to realize

Beautiful love, will my dreams come true?

Reaching for heaven, depending on you
Beautiful love, will my dreams come true?
