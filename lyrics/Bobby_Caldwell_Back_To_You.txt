I was a fool to be
Thinking just of me
And I thought myself we're
Better off this way
Ooh and I thought that leaving you
Was the thing to do
And I've regretted each
And every single day

Darling we had a lot to learn
But our heart's returned
And nothing's in our way

Back to you
I'm going back to you
No, I didn't know what love was
But darling now I do
And I know it might sound crazy
But I've changed my point of view
Guess I always knew I'd find my way
Back to you

I put our love behind
'Cause I made up my mind
That I'd find a way to spend
Those lonely nights
Ooh and I thought our love was gone
But you proved me wrong, baby
From the moment you came
Back into my life

Darling we had a lot to learn
But our heart's returned
And nothing's in our way

Back to you
I'm going back to you
No I didn't know what love was
But darling now I do
And my life has been so crazy
Just because of missing you

Living alone was hard to do
Now that I'm in your arms again
Make it forever more
Back to you
I'm going back to you

I'm going back to you
No I didn't know what love was
But darling now I do
And I know it might sound crazy
But I changed my point of view
Guess I always knew I find my way
Back to you
