She's got a way about her
I don't know what it is
But I know that I can't live without her
She's got a way of pleasing
I don't know what it is
But there doesn't have to be a reason anyway

She's got a smile that heals me
I don't know why it is
But I have to laugh when she reveals me
And she's got a way of talking
I don't know what it is
But it lifts me up when we are walking anywhere

She comes to me when I'm feelin' down
Inspires me without a sound
She touches me and I get turned around

She's got a way of showing
Oh, how I make her feel
And I find the strength to keep on going
She's got a light around her
Oh, and everywhere she goes
A million dreams of love surround her everywhere

She comes to me when I'm feelin' down
Inspires me without a sound
She touches me and I get turned around
Oh woah

She's got a smile that heals me
I don't know why it is
But I have to laugh when she reveals me
She's got a way about her
I don't know what it is
But I know that I can't live without her anyway
