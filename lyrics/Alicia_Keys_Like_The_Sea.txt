Love is like the sea
Leaves you on your knees
Then it pull you in
Then it takes ya, takes ya over, over
Love is like the sea
Leaves you on your knees
First, you're floating high
Then it takes ya, takes ya
Under, under

Well, it's cold
Cold under water
In the nighttime
But I dove
Dove to the bottom
To see what I'd find

That's when I saw a light
A glowing paradise
Thought I'd stay a while
It's been callin' me underwater, child
Everything that I ever dreamed
Taking my breath away (Ay)
Currents got hold of me
Sweeping me away
Wish that I could stay
Takes me to the top
It's a cycle that never stops

Love is like the sea
Leaves you on your knees
Then it pull you in
Then it takes ya, takes ya over, over
Love is like the sea
Leaves you on your knees
First you're floating high
Then takes ya, takes ya
Under, under

(Takes ya, takes ya over)
(Takes ya, takes ya under)
(Takes ya, takes ya over)
Over!
(Takes ya, takes ya, under)

See, I've been told
Told you only find it once in a lifetime
So you better hold
Hold on stronger then ever
Like it's the last time

So when you see the light
Like a ship in the night
You have found the place
You been looking for
Like a distant shore
Don't you ever look back again
Here's something you should know (Know)
The sea is still in control (That's right)
Cherish everyday
Cause you never know
It can take away
The very thing that you love the most (Love the most)

Love is like the sea
Leaves you on your knees
Then it pull you in
Then it takes ya, takes ya (Takes ya, takes ya over)
Over, over
Love is like the sea
Leaves you on your knees (leaves you on your knees)
First you're floating high
Then takes ya, takes ya (Takes ya, takes ya under)
Under, under

(Takes ya, takes ya over)
(Takes ya, takes ya under)
(Takes ya, takes ya over)
Over!
(Takes ya, takes ya under)
Listen, love is like the sea, yeah
(Takes ya, takes ya over)
(Takes ya, takes ya under)
Can you feel the pull?
(Takes ya, takes ya over)
It's calling you
(Takes ya, takes ya under)

Love is like the sea
Leaves you on your knees
Then it pulls you in (If you ever felt this way before)
Then it takes ya, takes ya
Over (Then you know)
Over
Love is like the sea
Leaves you on your knees
First you're floating high (Oh, get down on your knees)
Then it takes ya, takes ya
Under, under (Take me away)
