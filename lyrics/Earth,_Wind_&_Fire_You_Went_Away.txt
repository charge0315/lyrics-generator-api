How can we explain that we're apart
When all we've known is being together
Time had made our love a work of art
So sure we were, that nothing could change us
The dreams we thought tomorrow would bring us
Were fading away
Ah you reassured hope and I believed
That never would our promise be broken
And now, I question what is yet to be
When all is left for me is a token
Of dreams we used to build each day
You wouldn't stay
(You don't know) the very best part of me
(Baby, you don't know)
You don't know 'cause you went away
(I can't believe) you want no part of me
Since you went away, nothing's quite the same in my life
I may be shaken by this night
But I know the truth will never mislead me
I, I have the love, I have my life
And even with your memories beside me
I know the strength inside me will guide me
All of the way
(You don't know) the very best part of me
(Baby, you don't know)
'Cause you went away
(I can't believe) you want no part of me
Ever since you went away, nothing's quite the same
You don't know
Baby, you don't know
I can't believe
(Since you went away)
Since you went away
(Nothing's quite the same)
There's nothing quite the same
I don't know who to blame
Oh, nothing seems the same
