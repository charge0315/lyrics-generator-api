I can't believe I let this happen to me
It always ends up not good
That's why I know this can't be good

Open my eyes, first thing I see
Your lovely smile, smilin' at me
Kiss my forehead, up out of bed
Off to start your day, here in bed I stay
Thinkin' 'bout last night, replayin' in my mind
When you touch me there, ooh, it feels so right
Then intercedes, what am I doin'?
Get up out of bed to myself thinkin'

This can't be good (This can't be good)
This can't be good (This can't be good)
This can't be (Oh)
This can't be good (This can't be good)
This can't be good (This can't be good)
This can't be (Oh)
This can't be good
(Ooh)

What's goin' on?
What's happenin' to me?
Promised myself that I would never let this be
Never again (Never again)
Never that way (Never that way)
Cut me so deep that I haven't been the same
The way I feel right now, I felt before
When I hear your name and my feelings are floored
I'll fight it if I can, but I don't know if I should
The one thing I know, this can't be good, babe

This can't be good (This can't be good)
This can't be good (This can't be good)
This can't be (Oh)
This can't be good (This can't be good)
This can't be good (This can't be good)
This can't be (Oh)
This can't be good

Ooh, I think I'm fallin' in love again (In love again, oh no)
Tell myself I never would (Tell myself I never would)
I think I'm fallin' in love again (Ooh)
This cannot be good (Ooh, this cannot be good, ooh)

This can't be good (This can't be good)
This can't be good (This can't be good)
This can't be (Oh)
This can't be good (This can't be good)
This can't be good (This can't be good)
This can't be (Oh)
This can't be good
This can't be good (This can't be good)
This can't be good (This can't be good)
This can't be (Oh)
This can't be good (This can't be good)
This can't be good (This can't be good)
This can't be (Oh)
This can't be good

Ooh, I think I'm fallin' in love again
Tell myself I never would
I think I'm fallin' in love again
This cannot be good
Ooh, I think I'm fallin' in love again
Tell myself I never would
I think I'm fallin' in love again
This cannot be good

This can't be good
No, no, this can't be good
No, no, this can't be good
No, no, this can't be good
