Yes, baby doll, feel it?
Feel it fine!
Ooh baby, baby...
Give you anything your heart desires
It's my soul intention to have(?) your affection
'Cause you're the one who sets my world on fire
And I want you in my world forever
There ain't no mountain too high
For me to climb it for you baby, no
There ain't no ocean too wide
To ever stop this love of mine
And if you want the moon wrapped up
And brought by there right to your door
I would find a way
I would find a way to get it
I've been the world to you and if that won't do
Then I do something more
I would find a way
I would find a way, baby
Na na na na na na...
Just to make you happy, baby
I would find a way
Take you anywhere you ever dreamed of
There's no limitations if you're my inspiration
'Cause I can do anything if I've got your love
And no one will ever love you better
Show me a star in the sky
And I would steal it for you baby, whoah
There's nothing I wouldn't try
Just to keep you satisfied
And if you want the moon wrapped up
And brought by there right to your door
I would find a way
I would find a way to get it
I've been the world to you and if that won't do
Then I do something more
I would find a way
I would find a way, baby
Na na na na na na...
Just to make you happy, baby
I would find a way
I would find a way to keep you satisfied
I'll supply the love that you need, yeah, yeah
Ooh, I give you something to dream about each night
Baby, I'll make you happy every day, every night
Making my life's dedication to make sure that you look bright
You're my love, you're my inspiration
I'll find a way to keep you satisfied
To cherish your love is my life dedication
Nothing could ever stop this love of mine
