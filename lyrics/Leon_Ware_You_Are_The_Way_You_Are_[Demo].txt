Way you're standing there
I would never know you care
Whatever's on your mind
I will never know what's there
Only when you share
Then I'll know you care

You are the way you are
The way you are
Oh, you are the way you are
The way you are

The meetings that we have
Are a small part of what's there
But we can make it grow
If true love is what we're feeling
We can love what's real
With the lovе we feel

You are the way you arе
The way you are
You are the way you are
The way you are

There's a natural way
To have a way to your heart, loves, and all

You are the way you are
The way you are, oh yes you are
You are the way you are
The way you are, yes you are
Well, we are all the way we are
The way we are, ooh
We are the way we are
The way we are, yeah
We are the way we are
The way we are
You are the way you are
The way you are
You are the way you are
The way you are
