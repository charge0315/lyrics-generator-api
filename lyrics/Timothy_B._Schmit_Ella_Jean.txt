Schmit
I don't much like it when you are gone
Something's wrong when you're gone
I know you're safe and you won't be long
But I don't much like it when you're gone
This big old house isn't quite the same
When you're not here to call my name
I know you're right where you belong
Still I don't much like it when you're gone
Flowers in your hair
Walking in the sand
While you're far away
I do the best I can
Sometimes I wonder how my world would be
By myself, only me
I think I'd rather be a stepping stone
'Cause I don't much like it when you're gone
Ella, Ella Jean
Where are you?
Ella, Ella Jean
I miss you
I live my life like a hermit man
Walk my dog; wash my hands
I drive my car, nothing's really wrong
Still I don't much like it when you're gone
When I close my eyes
Lay me down to sleep
I can see your face
Smiling back at me
Every now and then you've been on my mind
Not too much - just all the time
But don't you worry, you know I'm strong
But I don't much like it when you're gone
Ella, Ella Jean
Where are you?
Ella, Ella Jean
I miss you
Ella, Ella Jean
Where are you?
Ella, Ella Jean
I miss you
