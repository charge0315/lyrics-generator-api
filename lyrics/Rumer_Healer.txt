Sometimes I feel so temporary
Just like these stars
Did somebody say
They might not even be there anyway?
I lie awake and think of all the
Time it might take
To reach them
Where did you go?
It's always, "I don't know, I don't know"
Carry me over if you're a healer
'Cause I don't know how long I'm gonna be here
Tear me down
Could you save my soul?
Give me a reason to carry on
Sometimes I feel so temporary
Just like those summer days
If I close my eyes
I can hear you laughing
And time is a friend when broken hearts
Are trying to mend
Like this one
If I close my eyes
I can feel you're with me
Carry me over if you're a healer
'Cause I don't know how long I'm gonna be here
Tear me down
If you can, spare my soul
Give me a reason to carry on
Carry on
