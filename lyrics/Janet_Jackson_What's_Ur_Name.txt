Ah, hold up
Slow it down
I can see you're new in town
'Cause I'd never, forget you face
That smile you wear was amazin'
I just wanna know where you're headed
I can roll with you baby
Make some room in your life
I don't wanna take up time
So baby, what's your name?

What's your name, babe?
Do you live around here?
'Cause I ain't never seen you before
But I wanna see you some more
What's your name, babe?
Put it right in my Sidekick
And I'll hit you back
Soon as I get home

I'll put you in my favorites
The swag you got left a print
In my mind as time goes by
All I can think of you
Why you gotta be so fine?
Wish I could see you again
Got me walkin' 'round
Lookin' for you, I'm trippin'
Damn, what you do to me?
Can't believe how you got me
And I don't even know your name

What's your name, babe?
Do you live around here?
'Cause I ain't never seen you before
But I wanna see you some more (Tell me, what's your name?)
What's your name, babe?
Put it right in my Sidekick
And I'll hit you back
Soon as I get home

Oh, you're not just some random guy
I can't let this moment pass me by
I gotta do what I gotta do
Take advantage, make the first move
'Cause I don't wanna have to regret it
I just wanna know your name

What's your name, babe?
Do you live around here?
'Cause I ain't never seen you before
But I wanna see you some more
What's your name, babe?
Put it right in my Sidekick
And I'll hit you back
Soon as I get home
What's your name, babe?
Do you live around here?
'Cause I ain't never seen you before
But I wanna see you some more
What's your name, babe?
Put it right in my Sidekick
And I'll hit you back
Soon as I get home

Home
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah, baby
