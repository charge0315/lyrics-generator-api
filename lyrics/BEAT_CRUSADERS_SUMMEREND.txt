This is a sound of summerend
The summer ends
The silence comes in
This is a sound of summerend
The summer ends
The silence falls in
Every vessel has been tied and
Calm down
Tracing every memory of you
Now
Here comes sound of summerend
The summer ends
The silence comes in
Here comes sound of summerend
The summer ends
The silence falls in
Every single day we used to
Calm down
Tracing every memory left
Behind
Ocean
Emotion
Cautions
Oh"¦
This is a sound of summerend
The summer ends
The silence comes in
Every single day we used to
Calm down
Tracing every memory left
Behind
Ocean
Emotion
Cautions
Oh"¦
