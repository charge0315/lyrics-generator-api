Yeah, baby
I wanna tell
I wanna tell you, baby
What's going on, yeah

So you call me up and say
"Girl what's goin' on?"
Someone told you
I had done you wrong
People always talking (yeah)
Sayin' crazy things
It's just jealousy
Well, if you wanna know the truth
Boy, I'm telling you
Hey
He was just a friend of mine
If we start to question each other
It'll tear us apart
Baby, let's not start

Don't you doubt my love
I'm never gonna give you up
Who can you believe
Your friends or me?
I'm not gonna leave
Oh, baby
I will always be

Forever in your love
Forever in your love
Forever in your love
Forever in your love

Stood right by your side, babe
Held you through the night
I never let you down
When you need someone to believe in
Put your trust in me
Ain't that what love's about?

When I'm home sitting alone
Thinking about you
Yeah
And what we do together
Makes me want more
'Cause I'm sure
That I'm forever in your love
What you do for me
You know a kiss from head to toe
Makes me wanna scream to the heavens up above
Knowing that
I'm forever in your love
Baby
Yeah, word to your mother
