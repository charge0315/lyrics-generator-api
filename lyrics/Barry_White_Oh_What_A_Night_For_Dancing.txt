Oh, we're goin' out tonight
Finger poppin'
You look out-a-sight
Won't be no stoppin'
All the discotheques
Better be ready
We're gonna hit em hard
Hard and heavy

Party strong
All night long
Just you, girl, and me

You're my million dollar baby
My pretty sexy lady
Oh (ohhh)
Oh what a night (what a night)
For dancing
(Ohhh)
Oh what a night (what a night)
For romancing

We're, we're gonna laugh and dance
Half the night away
We're gonna scream and shout
While the music plays
Then around about two
Tell you what I'm gonna do
Girl, I'm gonna take you home
And stick plenty love to you

Let's get it on
All night long
Just you, girl, and me

You're my million dollar baby
My pretty sexy lady
Oh (ohhh)
Oh what a night (what a night)
What a night for dancing
(Ohhh)
What a night, yeah (what a night)
For romancing

Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh oooooooh

Ohhhh (ohhh)
Oh what a night (what a night)
What a night for dancing
(Ohhh)
What a night, oh what a night (what a night)
For romancing
Ohhh oh oh what a night (what a night)
What a night for dancing
(Ohhh)
Ohh, what a night (what a night)
What a night for romancing
You're my million dollar baby
You're my pretty sexy lady
Ohhh what a night (what a night)
What a night what a night for dancing
Ooh ooh ooh, yeah

What a night, yeah (what a night)
For romancing
Ooh ooh ooh, yeah
Baby
