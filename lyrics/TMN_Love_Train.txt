When I was in love
Thought it was enough
Riding on that glass love train
When we were
Dancing as a river
Riding on a glass love train hey hey

You can't stop these wheels in motion
You can't stop this train
Hey hey

When you were a shadow
Following the light
Hiding on a glass love train
Do you feel the same
Everybody changes
Hiding on a glass love train hey hey

You can't stop these wheels in motion
You can't stop this train
Hey hey

When I was in love
Looking through a window
Riding on a glass love train
Will you take my soul
Gentle as a river
Riding on a glass love train hey hey

You can't stop these wheels in motion
You can't stop this train
Hey hey
You can't stop these wheels in motion
You can't stop these wheels in motion
You can't stop these wheels in motion
You can't stop this train
Train train
Train train
Train train
Train train
