Searching in the sky one night, while looking for the moon
I viewed a mighty light approaching in a zoom
Need was there to tell someone of my discovery
Fifteen seconds later, a light appeared in front of me
To my surprise, there stood a man with age and mystery
His name was Jupiter and came to visit me

The name is Jupiter, from the galaxy
I came to meet you, to make you free
Deliver to you a flower from
A distant planet, from where I come

Keep your eye on Jupiter, such beauty in the sky
We will wait for your return in the by and by
Keep your eye on Jupiter, memories we shall fulfill
Just to view a brighter day and do a righteous will
Hey

Watching and considering my visual state of mind
The flower fragrance help reveal to me the sign
The sign of love I had confessed to live and really know
The sign of love which I had failed my fellow man to show

The name is Jupiter, from the galaxy
(My fellow man to show)
I came to meet you, to make you free
Deliver to you a flower from
A distant planet from where I come
The name is Jupiter, from the galaxy
I came to meet you to make you free (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Deliver to you a flower from
A distant planet from where I come

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, oh

The name is Jupiter, from the galaxy
I came to meet you to make you free
Deliver to you a flower from
A distant planet from where I come
