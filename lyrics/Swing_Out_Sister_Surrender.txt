Try to forget torment
Lying behind a smile
Tears for sentiment
Now I've done my time

You filled my head with your opinions
Blind to your lies I listened

Still waiting for love to take revenge
(Waiting for love's revenge)
For that sweet surrender (Surrender)
Still waiting for love to take revenge
(Surrender, surrender, surrender, surrender)
Revenge
(Surrender, surrender, surrender, surrender)

You'll get what you deserve
Hiding behind a lie
Revenge says more than words
You'll pay for your crime

I fooled myself you'd change your ways
Blind to your lies I listened

Still waiting for love to take revenge
(Waiting for love's revenge)
For that sweet surrender (Surrender)
Still waiting for love to take revenge
(Surrender, surrender, surrender, surrender)
Still waiting for love to take revenge
(Waiting for love's revenge)
For that sweet surrender (Surrender)
Still waiting for love to take revenge
(Surrender, surrender, surrender, surrender)
Revenge
(Surrender, surrender, surrender, surrender)

Still waiting for love to take revenge
(Waiting for love's revenge)
For that sweet surrender (Surrender)
Still waiting for love to take revenge
(Surrender, surrender, surrender, surrender)
Still waiting for love to take revenge
(Waiting for love's revenge)
Waiting for love (Surrender)
Still waiting for love to take revenge
(Surrender, surrender, surrender, surrender)
Still waiting for love to take revenge
(Waiting for love's revenge)
Still waiting for love (Surrender)
To take revenge, love's sweet revenge
Waiting for love's revenge, love
(Surrender, surrender, surrender, surrender)

Ooh, woo-ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
(Waiting for love's revenge)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh (Surrender)
