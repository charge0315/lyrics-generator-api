When you were wrapped in tangles
I was free
And when you were undecided
I believed

It's all right tonight
On a deep blue mountain high
We're shapes that go together
You and I

When you were filled with longing
I belonged
When you were weak from trying
I was strong

But it's all right tonight
On a deep blue mountain high
We're shapes that go together
You and I
We're shapes that go together
You and I, alright

Childhood winters
Come to me
Whisper softly
So tenderly
I know, I walked twenty-five miles to hold you
Just to find you'd moved away

When you were wrapped in tangles
I was free
And when you were almost blinded
I could see

But it's all right tonight
On a deep blue mountain high
We're shapes that go together
You and I
We're shapes that go together
You and I

You and I (Shapes that go together)
You and I (Shapes that go together)
(Shapes that go together)
We go together (Shapes that go together)
You and I (Shapes that go together)
(Shapes that go together)
(Shapes that go together)
You were wrapped in tangles (Shapes that go together)
I was free (Shapes that go together)
I was free (Shapes that go together)
