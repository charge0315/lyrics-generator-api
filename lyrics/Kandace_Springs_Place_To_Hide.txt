If you're lonely anytime
You can talk to me
When there's trouble on your mind
I will always be
Heal and shield you from it all
The best way that I can
Anything you want from me

Call me day
Call me night
Call me anytime you need someone to hold you
The tears in your eyes
Will be gone
They will dry
And if you still fight and you can face the world outside
Let me be your place to hide, ah

I could always lie to you
If that's worth your need
Tell your life is never cruel
And people never leave
And love's not always kind
And hearts break all the time
Even if I'm far from you

Call me day
Call me night
Call me anytime
You need someone to hold you
The tears in your eyes
Will be gone
They will dry
And if you still fight and you can face the world outside
Let me be your place to hide

Little corner of the world is what I give to you
Somewhere we can find
And understanding life can be so sweet, yeah

Call me day
Call me night
Call me anytime
You need someone to hold you
The tears in your eyes
Will be gone
They will dry
And if you still fight and you can face the world outside
Let me be your place to hide, oh

Let me be your place to hide
