I put a spell on you, oh, cause you're mine
You gotta stop the things that you do
I ain't lyin', no I ain't lyin'
I just can't stand
The way you always run around
I can't stand it
The way you alwys put me down
I put a spell on you, cause you're mine!
Oh, oooh...
I put a spell on you, cause you're mine!
You know...
You'd better stop the things you doing
I ain't lying, yeah I ain't lyin'
I just can't stand it
The way you always run around
I can't stand it
Way you always try to put me down
I put a spell on you, cause you're mine!
Yeah you're mine!
