Winter coming on, yeah
I need your love to keep me warm
You're the only girl I love
Got to loving, worth a lot of soul
Now the time I need you around
Girl, don't turn your heater down

Through the summer you looked cute
Sporty thongs, I played the suit, now, now
Higher waist behind woolen slacks
Girl, you know I can't just go for that
Girl, I need your love from head to toe
Girl, don't turn your heater down

Hanging real tight now, yeah
Lovely day and night, oh, yeah
Lots of chill from my spine, love
Ooh, girl, I'm out of my mind, oh!
It's alright
Ooh, yeah
Come on, come on, come
Uh!

Don't you know, you've got it made
Light your fire, pull down the shades
Let me get myself together
And I can love you in any kind of weather
What you got, I'm glad I found
Girl, don't turn your heater down

Oh, girl, don't turn your heater down
Oh, yeah, don't turn your heater down
Hey, girl, don't turn your heater down
Hey, girl, don't turn your heater down
