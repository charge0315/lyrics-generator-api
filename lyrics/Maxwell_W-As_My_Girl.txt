Turn the lights down low, something you gotta see, yeah (Gotta see, yeah)
Gotta let you know all that's here in me (Yeah, yeah)
Say you wanna go, so we can both break free, lady, lady

You won't open up wide (How? How?)
How can you not open up wide? (How? How?)
How could you do that to me, child?
When you know, know I love you, girl (Oh, oh)

Turn the lights down low, tell me what you could see, yeah
Tell me what you know 'bout everything you and me
Baby, if you wanna go, then I got a place we can be, lady, lady

How did you not wanna, wanna, wanna open, open wide? (How? How?)
How could you make me ride? (How? How?)
How could you, how could you do that to me, why?
When you know that I love you, girl
Love you, girl

Turn the lights down low
Gotta see, yeah (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Gotta let you know
