All my life I've been told
Men don't show much emotion
And they say
With love we play
Games that have no devotion
Now I'm the type to fall in love
Every morning
Stay right here
Girl, don't you fear
I'll never hurt you
For your love
There's nothing that I wouldn't do
Here's my heart
Wanna live my life with you
Yes I do, yes I do, yes I do
Spend all my days and nights
Always lovin' you, so baby

Two hearts
Can't stop
Love's feelings
That's deeper every moment we're living
Can't stop this lovin' feeling
Every time I look at you, baby
You remind me of heaven
Stars at night are in your light, girl
Saying that I'm crazy
For your love
There's nothing that I wouldn't do
Here's my heart
Wanna live my whole life with you
Yes I do, yes I do, yes I do
Spend all my days and nights
Always lovin' you, so baby
(Chorus)

When we're face to face
Love is a blessing, baby
That no one can control (No one can control, aw, girl)
No matter what they say
Love is a lesson, baby
And I won't let you go, no, baby
(Chorus)
Can't stop this lovin' feeling
Lady, don't stop
Do me the same way, baby
Start from the top
Lost in this lovin' feeling
Can't hide this lovin' feeling
(Repeat)
