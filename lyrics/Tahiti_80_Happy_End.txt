When you want to make me happy
Please don't ask me what to do
I'm not sure I'm the one you want to please
I think it's you, I guess you know it too
Do you really try to change things
Improve them?
Somtimes I feel, you just do the opposite
(Chorus)
And every time we go out of phase
I act if I hadn't noticed it
Hoping everything will go away, with a wave
Of the hand and a happy end
Do you really try to change things
Improve them?
Somtimes I feel, you just do the opposite
I know how the story ends
We are so predictable
But each time your love for me dies a little more
(Chorus)
Make me happy
(Chorus)
Hoping everything will go away
With a wave of the hand
I know you understand
That we all deserve
Just a happy end
