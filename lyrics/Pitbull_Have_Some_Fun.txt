All I wanna do is have some fun (Mr. Worldwide!)
I got a feeling, that I’m not the only one
(The Wanted!) All I wanna do is take you home
I got a feeling (Afrojack), this party has just begun
It’s all I want (Reporting live from the UK)
I got a feeling, that I’m not the only one
It’s all I want
And I got a feeling, that you’re gonna give me some
(Woo!)
It’s all I want

Baby, it’s all I want

You know the type of women that I like (I like)
The ones that understand my life (My life)
The ones that understand wrong is right
Let’s do some wrong tonight
You name it, I'll do it, all is the fluid
I’m Spanish influent (Haha), that means my tongue is bilingual
Ready to play with that spot that you tingle

Uh got a dingo, she’s a star, Ringo
Her and two friends? Mmm, I like that lingo (Haha)
She asked if I’m single
I said of course not, and she loved it (Hahaha)
Next thing you know, we were both having fun in public
Hahaha

All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling, that I’m not the only one

You know I love an open mind (Mind)
So I can see what you thinking (Thinking)
That way I could give you exactly what you want
Matter of fact what you drinking (Drinking)
Some call it pimping, I call it leverage (Leverage)
I call it slipṗing, they call it marriage (Marriage)

She got me up like the Eiffel tower
No Paris, momma, you can fuck like the rabbits
But no diamonds, no carats
She asked if I was single, I said of course not
And she loved it
Next thing you know, we were both having fun in public
