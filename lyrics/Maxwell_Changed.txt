Y'all ready?
Uh, yeah, uh, yeah, yeah, uh
Ooh, ooh

Back when I was four or three
Clouds came rushing 'round into my sunshine
Clouds got a hold of me, they brought me way, way down
Clouds so my baby believed, but you were not around

So now what you tryna be?
What you tryna, tryna do to me?
You got me catching feelings with an urgency
Now that I've changed my mind

Sorry, I wasn't sure of your love
Ooh, sorry, so once afraid that you would figure out the crutch
Then make a move and come and go and go and leave me
Like the others left me (Me) when things got deep
Before you make me go, girl
Promise you won't do that to me, baby

Now what you tryna be?
What you tryna, tryna do to me?
You got me catching feelings in the third degree
Now that I've changed my mind
Everything was just fine
When you wanted to ruin my life
Now it's plain and easy for me to see
Now that I've changed my mind, oh

Now that I don't wanna settle the score
Game never felt so free
Now that I don't wanna hurt no more
There's plenty more left for me

'Cause everything was just fine
You wanted to ruin my life
And it's plain and easy for me to see
Now that I've changed my mind
So now what you tryna be?
What you tryna be, babe? Oh (Tryna do to me?)
Feelings in the third degree
Now that I've changed my mind (Now that I've changed my mind)
Now what you tryna be?
Tryna do to me?
Feelings with an urgency
Now that I've changed my mind (Now that I've changed my mind)
So now what you tryna be?
Tryna do to me?
Feelings in the third degree
Now that I've changed
Now that I've changed my mind (Changed my mind)
