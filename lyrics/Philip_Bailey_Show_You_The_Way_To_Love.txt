Light up my life with a smile every day
I can tell you heaven is just a breath away
Deep within my heart, there's a love I feel for you
And I want you to know, that you
You don't have to walk around
Feeling lonely, lost for lovin' when the sun goes down
'Cause I wanna give you what you need
Let me inside
I'll show you the way to love, uh huh, uh huh
I'll show you the way to love, uh huh
Will you let me inside?
All of my life I believed love was true
And the pictures in my mind, they were only of you
Let me be the one to hold you safe in my arms
When the magic is won
Then you, like a fire in the night
We can feel the heat and it's going deep
'Til it melts away all the cold
Making everything right
Will you be mine?
I'll show you the way to love, uh huh, uh huh
I'll show you the way to love, uh huh
Love is the future
You can throw your fears away
Love is the past
Love has brought us to this day, baby
Time won't keep waiting
For an answer from your heart to love
Let me show you the way, baby, baby, baby, to love
Won't you give me your heart, baby, baby, baby, alright
You know love is the future and love is the past
We are together, baby
Let's make it last
