Far far, there was this little girl
She was praying for something to happen to her
Everyday she writes words and more words
Just to speak out the thoughts that keep floating inside
And she's strong when the dreams come
Cause they take her, cover her, they are all over
The reality looks far now, but don't go

How can you stay outside?
There's a beautiful mess inside
How can you stay outside?
There's a beautiful mess inside, oh

Far, far there was this little girl
She was praying for something good to happen to her
From time to time there are colors and shapes
Dazzling her eyes, tickling her hands
They invent her a new world with
Oil skies and aquarel rivers
But don't you run away already
Please don't go

How can you stay outside?
There's a beautiful mess inside
How can you stay outside?
There's a beautiful mess inside

Take a deep breath and dive
There's a beautiful mess inside
How can you stay outside?
There's a beautiful mess, beautiful mess inside
Beautiful, beautiful

Far far, there was this little girl
She was praying for something big to happen to her
Every night she hears beautiful strange music
It's everywhere, there's nowhere to hide
But if it fades she begs, "Oh Lord, don't take it from me
Don't take it yourselves"
I guess I'll have to give it birth, to give it birth
I guess, I guess I have to give it birth
I guess I have to, have to give it birth
There's a beautiful mess inside and it's everywhere
So shake it yourself now deep inside
Deeper than you ever dared
Deeper than you ever dared
There's a beautiful mess inside
Beautiful mess inside
