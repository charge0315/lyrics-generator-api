News got out in several days
Reached me on the first
You were out to leave me
But I hadn't heard the worst, and
As the rain from night came in
Awaiting on your call
I don't want to hear it
I already know it all
Don't let me cry on you
Let it do what it do
Don't make me blue
I'll cry on you
As my heart was filled with pain
I thought I heard a car
Too upset to look and see
Dropped a falling star
There might be another one
Who's taken you today
Should I want to think I want
To take his life away?
Oh don't let me cry on you
Let it do what it do
Don't say we're through
I'll cry on you
Now the day is over
It was all too much for me
You're across the world by now
I'm in misery
They say you say I say the things
Nobody understands
As I'm about to weep, my love
In shaking cupped-up hands
Oh, don't let me cry on you
Shelter your sweet hair-do
Don't make me sue
I'll cry on you
On you
On you
On you
