Meglio stasera
A-baby, go, go, go
Or as we natives say
"Fa subito!"

If you're ever gonna kiss me
It had better be tonight
While the mandolins are playing
And stars are bright

Mmm , if you've anything to tell me
It had better be tonight
Or somebody else may tell me
And whisper the words just right

Meglio stasera
Baby, go, go, go
Or as we natives say
"Fa subito!"

If you're ever gonna hold me
It had better be tonight
Or somebody else may hold me
They might make me feel just right

Meglio stasera
Baby, go, go, go
Or as we natives say
"Fa subito!"

For this poor Americano
A-who knows little of your speech
Be a nice Italiana
And start to teach
Mmm, go Ahead!

Show me how in old Milano
Lovers hold each other, oh, so tight
But I warn you, sweet paesana
But it had better be tonight

Meglio stasera
Baby, go, go, go
Or as we natives say
"Fa subito!"
