When I came to Angel City, I was on the run
Blinded by my own pity, I was nearly done
Stock heartbroken, bitter, and poor, burdened down by sin
I fought hard to find the door, didn't know how to get in

Time and time at hand, you helped me over the sand
Gently rising to be, you walked a mile with me
And I saw the sea

I am found where I was lost, I am closer to free
Heart unbound, whatever the cost, all rivers fall to the sea

Time and time at hand, you helped me over the sand
Gently rising to be, you walked a mile with me
And I saw the sea

Time and time at hand, you helped me over the sand
Gently rising to be, you walked a mile with me
And I saw the sea
