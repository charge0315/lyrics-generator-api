Girl, there is an open door
Feelings you haven't explored
You're awake through the night
I wanna be there just to hold you so tight
Can't wait one minute more
This longing for you can't be ignored
Am I moving too fast?
I wanna be there to console you
(Chorus)
I'll take you to heaven tonight
Make you feel like paradise
Like a woman should feel
I'll do you right if it takes all night
Take you to heaven
You want to trust in, trust in love one more time
You caution your heart
Let your mind believe in me
I'd never do nothing to hurt you
Chorus
(Bridge)
Can't sleep, can't eat, I can't breath, ooh wee
I need you right here with me, baby
'Cause when you're in my life, I tell ya that it's sheer ecstasy
Chorus
