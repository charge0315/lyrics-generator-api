One, two, one, two, three
I wanna be (Naked)
(Naked)

I got a, I got a, a five-star dinner for ya
I drove a, I drove a, a brand new 'Cedes for ya
Red rover, red rover, I bring them kisses over
The vibes are gettin' insane
I'm tryin', I'm tryin' to be real classy for ya
No lyin', no lyin', I got real feelings for ya
This clothin', this clothin' is turnin' into torture
Got one thing left on my brain

I wanna be naked with you
With no lights on, just the moon
I wanna be naked with you
We'll leave our clothes on the floor, put a sock on the door
I wanna be naked with you
At least I'm tellin' the truth
I wanna be naked with you
We'll leave our drama outside, bring your body to mine

I wanna be (Naked)
I wanna be (Naked)
I wanna be

Natural, natural, there's nothin' dirty 'bout it
Masterful, masterful, keep puttin' pressure on it
True lovin', true lovin', I think I finally found it
The vibes are gettin' insane, hey

I haven't been so alive since the past life
I swear to God you were mine in the past life

I wanna be naked with you
With no lights on, just the moon
I wanna be naked with you
We'll leave our clothes on the floor, put a sock on the door
I wanna be naked with you
At least I'm tellin' the truth
I wanna be naked with you
We'll leave our drama outside, bring your body to mine

I wanna be (Naked)
I wanna be (Naked)
I wanna be (Naked)
I wanna be naked with you

I haven't been so alive since the past life (I wanna be)
I swear to God you were mine in the past life (I wanna be)

I wanna be naked with you
Naked with you (I wanna be)

Naked with you (Naked)
With no lights on, just the moon
I wanna be naked with you (Naked)
We'll leave our clothes on the floor, put a sock on the door
I wanna be naked with you (Naked)
At least I'm tellin' the truth
I wanna be naked with you (Naked)
We'll leave our drama outside, bring your body to mine

I wanna be (Naked)
I wanna be
I wanna be (Naked)
I wanna be naked with you
