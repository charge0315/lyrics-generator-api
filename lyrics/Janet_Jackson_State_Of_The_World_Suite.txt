Five A.M. rise and shine
To feed the baby before he starts to cry
No rest, no time to play
Fifteen, the mother is a runaway
No time for dreams or goals
Pressure is so strong
Her body she has sold so her child can eat

What is happening to this world we live in
In our home and other lands

Drugs and crime spreadin' on the streets
People can’t find enough to eat
Now our kids can't go out and play
That's the state of the world today
State of the world, ooh baby
(Drugs and crime)

Lil’ Johnny all alone
His only friend, the doll he carries with him
Goes to school each and every day
To be teased because he has no place to stay
This young and homeless boy feels his life is worthless
Instead of suicide he cries himself to sleep

And it's happenin' to this world we live in
There's got to be a better way

Drugs and crime spreadin' on the streets
People can't find enough to eat
Now our kids can't go out and play
That's the state of the world today
State of the world, ooh, ooh

Mason!
Can’t give up hope now
Let’s weather the storm to, together

Drugs and crime spreadin' on the streets
People can’t find enough to eat
Now our kids can't go out and play
That's the state of the world today
Drugs and crime spreadin' on the streets
People can’t find enough to eat
Now our kids can't go out and play
That's the state of the world today
Drugs and crime spreadin' on the streets
People can't find enough to eat
(Starvin' people)
Now our kids can't go out and play
(They can't even walk the streets)
That's the state of the world today
(Don't give up, state of the world today, hey hey hey)

Drugs and crime, drugs and crime
Drugs and crime, drugs and crime
Drugs and crime, drugs and crime
Drugs and crime (That's the state of the world today)
Drugs and crime (That's the state of the world today)
