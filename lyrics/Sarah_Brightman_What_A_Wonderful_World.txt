I see trees of green, red roses too
I see them bloom for me and you
And I think to myself
What a wonderful world
And I think to myself
What a wonderful world

I see skies of blue, clouds of white
The bright blessed day, the dark sacred night
And I think to myself
What a wonderful world

The colours of the rainbow, so pretty in the sky
Are also on the faces of the people going by
I see friends shaking hands, saying "How do you do?"
They're really saying "I love you"

I hear babies crying, I watch them grow
They'll learn much more than I'll ever know
And I think to myself
What a wonderful world
And I think to myself
What a wonderful world

Wonderful world
Wonderful world
A wonderful world
A wonderful world
