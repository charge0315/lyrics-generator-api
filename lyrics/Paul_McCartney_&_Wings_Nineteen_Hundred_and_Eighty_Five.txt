Oh, no one ever left alive in nineteen hundred and eighty-five will ever do
She may be right, she may be fine
She may get love, but she won't get mine, 'cause I got you

Oh, I
Oh, I
Well, I just can't get enough of that sweet stuff my little lady gets behind

Shake it
Baby, don't break it

Oh, my mama said the time would come when I would find myself in love with you
I didn't think, I never dreamed
That I would be around to see it all come true

Woah, I
Oh, I
Well, I just can't get enough of that sweet stuff my little lady gets behind

Oh, no one ever left alive in nineteen hundred and eighty-five will ever do
Well, she may be right, she may be fine
She may get love, but she won't get mine, 'cause I got you

Oh, I
Oh, I
Well, I just can't get enough of that sweet stuff my little lady left behind

Band on the run
For the band on the run
Band on the run
