Come! See! High above
Come! See! High in the heavens
A new star shining bright;
Out of the darkness comes a light

Come! Hear midnight chimes
Come! Hear bells that are ringing
And from some distant shore
Sounds of a journey echo on

This is the night
They say
Everyone wants a dream
This is the night
They say
Nothing is as it seems

Come! Sleep! Close your eyes
Come! Sleep! Give me your sorrow
And I'll keep watch for you
Until the dawn is breaking through
Until the morning wakens you

Come! Dream through the night
Come! Dream, and then tomorrow
You'll see your heart will know
Dreams are more precious than gold
Dreams are more precious than gold
Dreams are more precious than gold
