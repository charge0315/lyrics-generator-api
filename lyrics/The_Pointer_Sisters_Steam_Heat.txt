When we were kids in Oakland
Sitting on our daddy's knees
In the summer we would swelter
In the winter we would freeze
We'd freeze
When we'd wake up in the morning
We could always see our breath
If there hadn't been so many of us
We'd have froze to death
Then we got our flat on Franklin Street
With garbage in the yard
And the floor was kind of shaky
And the times was kinda hard
And I always will remember
How we spent our Friday nights
Sitting hot on 'round the radiator
Banging on the pipes
Yеs we always will remembеr
How we spent our Friday nights
Sitting hot on 'round the radiator
Banging on the pipes
Now we live in a new house
Got a bedroom of my own
And an automatic thermostat
You'll set and let alone
Alone
Now there's just one little problem
About turning on the gas
There's a fifty-five-page waiting list
And we're the very last
Now there's just one little problem
About turning on the gas
There's a fifty-five-page waiting list
And we're the very last
So we gather 'round the fireplace
We huddle in a pack
When we finally get the front side warm
We'd turn and warm the back
When we sit around remembering
The steam heat that we had
That noisy leaky radiator
Doesn't seem so bad
When we sit around remembering
The steam heat that we had
That noisy leaky radiator
Doesn't seem so bad

Yeah
I got, steam heat
I got, steam heat
I got, steam heat
But I need your love to keep away the cold
I got, steam heat
I got, steam heat
I got, steam heat
But I can't get warm without your hand to hold
The radiator's hissin', still I need your kissin'
To keep me from freezin' each night
I got a hot water bottle, but nothin' I got'll
Take the place of you holding me tight
I got, steam heat
I got, steam heat
I got, steam heat
But I need your love to keep away the cold
They told me to shovel more coal in the boiler
They told me to shovel more coal in the boiler
They told me to shovel more coal in the boiler
But that don't do no good
They told me to pour some more oil in the burner
They told me to pour some more oil in the burner
They told me to pour some more oil in the burner
But that don't do no good
Coal in the boiler, no good
Oil in the burner, no good
Well is it coal, no, hot, yes
Yes, yes, yes
Come on people, get hot
They told me to shovel more coal in the boiler (Boink, boink)
They told me to shovel more coal in the boiler (Boink, boink)
They told me to shovel more coal in the boiler
But that don't do no good
They told me to pour some more oil in the burner (Boink, boink)
They told me to pour some more oil in the burner (Boink, boink)

But that don't do no good

Take the place of you holding me tight

When we sit around remembering that heat that we had
That noisy leaky radiator doesn't seem so
Bad
