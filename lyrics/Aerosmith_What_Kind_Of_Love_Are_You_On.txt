You say one thing then you do another
You've got it all wrong so you blame it on your mother
You're kicking the dog because you can't get the cat
You know it ain't cool but you like it like that
Everybody talking about what it is what it ain't
Kiss on the devil and you piss off a saint
But it can't be love if you don't have to crawl
You say you don't need nothing but you've got to have it all

I want to know... what kind of love are you on?

Jelly roll Jane, rolling on the rug
Toking on a lover like a brand new drug
Do the same thing every damn day
Do the same thing, do the same thing
Never seem to get enough

I want to know... what kind of love are you on?
I've got to know... what kind of love are you on?

When Jack took Jill up that hill
She charged his ass a quarter
Well he flipped his lid, uh, cause what she did
Oh, she shouldn't hadn't oughta
Rocking in a cradle with a high school vamp
Screaming at a homey like an old tube amp
Up, down, sideways, going in and out of phase
Everybody asks me why I kiss the girls and make them cry

I want to know... what kind of love are you on?
I wan to know... what kind of love are you on?
I've got to know... what kind of love are you on?
