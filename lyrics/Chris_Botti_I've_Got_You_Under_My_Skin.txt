I've Got You Under My Skin
I've got you under my skin
I've got you deep in the heart of me
So deep in my heart
That you're really a part of me
I've got you under my skin
I've tried so not to give in
I tell to myself this affaire will never go so well
But why should I try to resist when baby I know that well
That I've got you under my skin
I'd sacrifice anything come what might
For the sake of having you near
Inspite of the warning voice that comes in the night
And repeats, repeats in my ear
Don't you know little fool
You never can win
Oh use your mentallity
Wake up, wake up to reality
But each time that I do
Just the thought of you
Makes me stop just before I begin
'Cause I've got you under my skin
(Improv. Solos)
I'd sacrifice anything come what might
For the sake of having you near
Inspite of the warning voice that comes in the night
And repeats, repeats in my ear
Don't you know little fool
You never can win
Oh use your mentallity
Wake up, wake up to reality
But each time that I do
Just the thought of you
Makes me stop just before I begin
'Cause I've got you under my skin
'Cause I've got you under my skin
