(Boogie) Ah, you sexy, sexy (Boogie child)
(Boogie) The situation wrecks me (Come on, boogie, boogie)
(Boogie) I can't stand the way you do it (Boogie child)
(Boogie) Bad girl, don't put me through it (Come on, boogie, boogie)
(Boogie) Oh, right to the limit (Boogie child)
(Boogie) You're a bad girl, you got me in it (Come on, boogie, boogie)
(Boogie) A man could die for the way I'm thinking (Boogie child)
(Boogie) And I'm in too deep and I just keep sinking (Come on, boogie, boogie)
When you move it
Like you really know how to move me
I'll follow you wherever you go
I just wanna lay my love on you (Ah)
That boogie child, she can
(Boogie) Oh, you sexy, sexy (Boogie child)
(Boogie) The situation wrecks me (Come on, boogie, boogie)
(Boogie) I can't stand the way you do it (Boogie child)
(Boogie) Bad girl, don't put me through it (Come on, boogie, boogie)
Oh, boogie child, she's honey-sweet
She got a hungry love, it's good enough to eat
You can't touch her 'cause you know she's mine
Come on, boogie child, let your love-light shine
I just wanna lay my love on you
That boogie child, she can
(Boogie) Ah, you sexy, sexy (Boogie child)
(Boogie) The situation wrecks me (Come on, boogie, boogie)
(Boogie) I can't stand the way you do it (Boogie child)
(Boogie) Bad girl, don't put me through it (Come on, boogie, boogie)
You can't touch her 'cause you know she's mine
Come on, boogie child, let your love-light shine
I just wanna lay my love on you
That boogie child, she can
(Boogie) Ah, you sexy, sexy (Boogie child)
(Boogie) The situation wrecks me (Come on, boogie, boogie)
(Boogie) I can't stand the way you do it (Boogie child)
(Boogie) Bad girl, don't put me through it (Come on, boogie, boogie)
(Boogie) Oh, right to the limit (Boogie child)
(Boogie) Bad girl, you got me in it (Come on, boogie, boogie)
(Boogie) A man could die for the way I, for the way I'm thinking (Boogie child)
(Boogie) I'm in too deep, but I just keep sinking
Boogie, boogie child, come on, boogie, boogie
Boogie, boogie child, come on, boogie, boogie
Boogie, boogie child, come on, boogie, boogie
Boogie, boogie child
