Yeah ooh
Yeah ooh
You're so amazing

Breathless, you leave me breathless
The only air I wanna breathe is yours
Girl, your best is so effortless
Oh, you's what I wanna get into
And when I do I'm gonna

Live inside of you, spend a night or two
Beyond this, girl, I'm just frozen
See I'm not used to this, soon as you got undressed
You stop my heart, there's one way you'll say it, you are

You're amazing, baby, you're amazing
So amazing, ooh, amazing
Can I touch you, I just wanna love you
Let me just say that you are
You're amazing, baby, you're amazing
So amazing, ooh, amazing
Let me love you, girl, I won't waste it
Just wanna say that you are

Speechless, you got me speechless
Girl, I'm at loss for words
To say the things you've never heard before
I'm ready, you get me ready
To turn you out I start to search the softest place on earth

Is inside of you, (it is)
Nothing left to do
Not to take it, girl 'cause I need it
See I'm not used to this
I am so ready to promise you
Everything, everything 'cause you are

You're amazing, baby, you're amazing
So amazing, ooh, amazing
Can I touch you, I just wanna love you
Let me just say that you are
You're amazing, baby, you're amazing
So amazing, ooh, amazing
Let me love you, girl, I won't waste it
Just wanna say that you are

So amazing, just wanna let you know that you are
So amazing, yeah, yeah, yeah
Said I just wanna let you know that you
You are amazing
I know and I won't be satisfied until you are where I go
Deep inside you everything and everywhere
Doing it until we see the sun
(Starting over like we just begun)
Just wanna say that you are

You're amazing, baby, you're amazing
So amazing, ooh, amazing
Can I touch you? I just wanna love you
Just wanna say that you are
You're amazing, baby, you're amazing
So amazing, ooh, amazing
Let me love you, girl, I won't waste it
Just wanna say that you are
You're amazing, baby, you're amazing
So amazing, ooh, amazing
Can I touch you? I just wanna love you
Just wanna say that you are
You're amazing, baby, you're amazing
So amazing, ooh, amazing
Let me love you, girl, I won't waste it
Just wanna say that you are
You're amazing
And I just want to love you more than I
Amazing, amazing, amazing
I wanna lay you down
I wanna, oh I
