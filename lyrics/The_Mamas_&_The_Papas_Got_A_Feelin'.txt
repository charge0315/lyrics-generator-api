Got a feelin' that I'm wastin' time on you babe
Got a feelin' that you've been untrue
I got a feelin' that you're stealin'
All the love I thought I was givin' to you, baby, it's true

Got a feelin' that you're playin' some game with me babe
Got a feelin' that you just can't see
If you're entertainin' any thought that you're gainin'
By causin' me all of this pain and makin' me blue
The joke's on you

When I get to feeling that you're stealing love
And I don't know why, baby it makes me so discouraged
I finally get the courage not to cry, babe
Or even try, babe

Got a feelin' that I'm wasting time on you babe
Got a feelin' that you've been untrue
I got a feelin' that you're stealin'
All the love I thought I was givin' to you
Baby it's true, the joke's on you
Baby it's true, the joke's on you
