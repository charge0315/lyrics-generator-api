Ooh, oh yeah

It ain't no big thing that you're leavin'
We both needed a change of pace to just go on
'Cause it ain't no big thing, let's stop deceivin'
A game of charade went on too long, woah

There's no need to shed no tears (No need to shed no tears)
You and I should have no fears
About leavin' this unhappy home
This love affair we've both outgrown

Lookin' back at you
Where all the pieces fit
When you put them all together, boy
You must admit

That it ain't no big thing that you're leavin'
We both needed a change of pace to just go on
'Causе it ain't no big thing, let's stop deceivin'
A gamе of charade went on too long, woah

Yeah, there's no use of holding on
The party's over, the music is gone
'Cause I've waited for a menu change
But our main course just never came

In a year or two
When times erase my mind
I may see another you
But for now, I'm fine

'Cause it ain't no big thing that you're leavin'
We both needed a change of pace to just go on
'Cause it ain't no big thing, let's stop deceivin'
A game of charade went on too long
(It ain't no big thing that you're leavin')
You better get yourself together, boy
It ain't no big thing, let's stop deceivin'
A game of charade went on too long
'Cause it ain't no big thing that you're leavin'
We both needed a change of pace to just go on
'Cause it ain't no big thing, let's stop deceivin'
A game of charade went on too long
'Cause it ain't no big thing that you're leavin'
We both needed a change of pace to just go on
'Cause it ain't no big thing, let's stop deceivin'
A game of charade went on too long
(It ain't no big thing, let's stop deceivin')
It ain't no big thing
(It ain't no big thing that you're leavin')
(It ain't no big thing, let's stop deceivin')

(When times erase my mind)

(It ain't no big thing that you're leavin')
(It ain't no big thing, let's stop deceivin')
(It ain't no big thing that you're leavin')
You better get yourself together, boy
It ain't no big thing, let's stop deceivin'
A game of charade went on too long
'Cause it ain't no big thing that you're leavin'
We both needed a change of pace to just go on
'Cause it ain't no big thing, let's stop deceivin'
A game of charade went on too long
'Cause it ain't no big thing that you're leavin'
A game of charade went on too long
