Shooting and spinning get boring to me cause I was outside spinning with four of my-

Better ask how we get when we go over east, purgin, spin everyday in a week
Tra- shooter, I'm way too elite, I'm a fly lil shooter, doin hits in LV
We was just on the Nick tryna pack us a Bee, and we stay in the trap tryna stack us some cheese
Got caught on the cam cause I ain't have my mask, Drako B steady running, like I'm on your ass
You gave Mikey a hit and it had niggas gassed, I show Mikey some shots, seen the Hat niggas fast
We was stuck in EG, it was me sending
How we get to the lo tryna make us a pack
And we spinning so much I be getting off-track
And we beat from the back, I'mma put on her tracks
Opp niggas yelling, I'm yelling "We got one"
He was just tryna box and that boy caught a hot one
Naz Loc in a blunt, and this shit, this a hot one
We was yelling out "Aha", we knew that we shot him
We did not need to beef for GB to go spot him

She say I be shooting too much for her liking
We taking them bikes cause them niggas is biking

Bullets is hurting, they punching like lightning
Get the drop on an opp and that shit be exciting
And we spin through they block, yeah, that shit be so frightening
Catch a body, but that be some just overnight shit

Baow, watch how I up it and flock

Nigga ran in the store, he was lucky I ain't spark him
Hop out, I bet you I face him
I don't got the gun, I'mma do him like Jason
I keep a Glock with the waist in
Put the AR to work like I'm drawing a paintin'
He see me, then he gon need a prayin'
In love with my gun, .223, that's my favorite
Revolver start spinning, that shit in rotation
EMS on the scene, tryna get him some savin'
That boy breezy, got breezed, that's Brazy
And Ron Sleez shot, that's crazy, he got shot in the leg, a nigga can't  me (Grah, grah)
Niggas shot Ty Balla, and niggas flamed on Dre B
I done been through the hell shit and back, so why do you think that this fuck shit could break me
And if shots getting thrown, then bodies gon drop
And it's only gon stop if them white niggas chain me
Do you know who I am, you can't game me

Hit it raw, now she tryna claim me
Hit it twice, she gon end up with a baby
