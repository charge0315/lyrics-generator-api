Children of the ghetto
Runnin' wild and free
In the concrete jungle
Filled with misery
There's no inspiration
To brighten up their day
So out of desperation
I would like to say
Children of the ghetto
Keep your head
To the sky
Children of the ghetto
Always in the news
Toughness is their motto
And bitter are their blues
But deep inside the ghetto
There's a unity
Their councils are for sorrows
And no misery
Children of the ghetto
Keep your head
To the sky
To the sky
God's your inspiration
To brighten up your day
Don't you know
So out of consolation
I would like to say
Children of the Ghetto
Keep your head
To the sky
Sing with me this song now, children
Keep your head up
Keep it
Keep it up
Sing with me this song now, children
Keep your head up
Keep it
Keep it up
Don't you know
Everything
Is gonna be alright
If you just
Keep it up
Keep it up
Keep it up
Everything
Surely is gonna be alright
If you just
Keep it up
