Any time ago when I was tollin' on the rocks, add a little touch of attitude
Who's that Madam X coming in at three o'clock?
Why don't you send her over one too?

Next thing I remember, I was crawlin' round the room
She was dancing on the table, blood sure, barkin' at the moon

Colorado bulldog, this night has gone to my head
Colorado bulldog, throw a leash around my neck
Turn around and run like hell
Gimme a grumpy grumbler!

Swingin' from the rafters, I'm losing all control
Playin' a little game of cat and mouse
Above the question, I've been lonely much too long
Last call, "The drinks are on the house"

Next thing I remember, through the pandemonium
It was feeling like a nightmare, the bite right into my skin

Colorado bulldog, this night has gone to my head
Colorado bulldog, throw a leash around my neck
Turn around and run like hell
Come here, boy!

My sweet Lolita, or prayin' Manita, left me in the number six motel
How was I to know, she'd strip me to the bone and steal away my heart as well

Next thing I remember, through the pandemonium
It was feeling like a nightmare, the bite right into my skin

Colorado bulldog, this night has gone to my head
Colorado bulldog, throw a leash around my neck
Turn around and run like hell

Colorado bulldog, this night has gone to my head
Colorado bulldog, throw a leash around my neck
Bottom's up down the heck, it's time to start all over again

"Close your little eyes, Yankee!"
