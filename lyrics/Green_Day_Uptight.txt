I woke up on the wrong side of the floor
Made, made my way through the front door
Broke my engagement with myself
Perfect picture of bad health
Another notch scratched on my belt
The future just ain't what it used to be

I got a new start on a dead end road
Peaked, peaked out on reachin' new lows
Owed, paid off all my debts to myself
Perfect picture of bad health
Another notch scratched on my belt
The future's in my livin' room

Uptight, I'm a nag with a gun, yeah
All night, suicide's last call
I've been uptight all night
I'm a son of a gun
Uptight, I'm a nag with a gun, yeah
All night, suicide's last call
I've been uptight all night
I'm a son of a gun

Uptight, I'm a nag with a gun, yeah
All night, suicide's last call
I've been uptight all night
I'm a son of a gun
Uptight, I'm a nag with a gun, yeah
All night, suicide's last call
I've been uptight all night
I'm a son of a gun
Uptight, I'm a nag with a gun, yeah
All night, suicide's last call
I've been uptight all night
I'm a son of a gun
Uptight, I'm a nag with a gun, yeah
All night, suicide's last call
I've been uptight all night
I'm a son of a gun
