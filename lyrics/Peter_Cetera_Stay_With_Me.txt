How can you say it's over?
What can there be that we can’t overcome?
Why do you turn away?
Are you so afraid of needing someone?

Didn't we say forever?
I still believe feeling's strong enough
Before you walk away
Let me hear you say
You don’t need my love

Stay with me
Darling after all that we've been through
Nobody else can warm your lonely nights
No one's gonna love you like I do
Stay with me
Can't you see we've got too much to lose? (Ohhh)
So, stay with me, stay with me
Baby please

Where is our happy ending
All of our promises, did you forget?
Tell me what's the use in love if it can't last?
No I can't never let you leave it this way
I want you to stay

Stay with me
Darling after all that we’ve been through
Nobody else can warm your lonely nights
No one’s gonna love you like I do
Stay with me
Can't you see we’ve got too much to lose? (Ohhh)
So stay with me, stay with me
Please, baby please

Got to make you stay somehow
Tell me what's it gonna take
I can't live without you
Please don't leave me now

Stay with me
Darling after all that we’ve been through
Nobody else can warm your lonely nights
No one's gonna love you like I do
Stay with me
Can't you see we've got too much to lose? (Ohhh)
So stay with me, stay with me
Baby please
You've got to stay with me

(Stay with me, stay with me)
Stay with me
Can't you see we've got too much to lose?
(Stay with me, stay with me)
Stay with me
Please, baby why won't you stay?
(Stay with me, stay with me)
Stay with me
Can't you see we've got too much to lose?
(Stay with me, stay with me)
Stay with me
Please, baby please
(Stay with me, stay with me)
