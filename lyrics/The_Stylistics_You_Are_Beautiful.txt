You are beautiful
Not just because your eyes are
Although I know that's true, my love
You're beautiful because you're you
You are beautiful
Not just because your smile is
Although that's plain to see, my love
You're beautiful because you smile at me
And when I need a friend
Someone to pull me through
You are everything that I'll ever need
You are my strength
And like very few are
You arе beautiful
Not just because your facе is
Not just because of all the things you cannot buy
You are beautiful, beautiful
Because of what you are inside
You are beautiful, beautiful
Because of what you are inside
Woo...woo...ooh...ooh...
