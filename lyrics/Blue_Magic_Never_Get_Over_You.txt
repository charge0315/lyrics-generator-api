Never gonna get over you
I fell head over heels in love
We went together like hand and glove
But then you pulled the plug
Never gonna get, never gonna get over you
I know, it's gonna take some time
To get the thought of you off my mind
I still wish you were mine
Never gonna get, never gonna get over you
Never gonna get over you
Never gonna get over you
I did, all that a man could do
I can't accept the fact that we're through
What am I gonna do
Never gonna get, never gonna get over you
One time, we could kiss and make up
This time, our love has run out of luck
Oh why did we break up?
Never gonna get
Never gonna get over you
Never gonna get over you
