Am I sleeping with my eyes wide?
Am I alone?
Am I staring into bright lights?
Have I gone home?
I must be dreaming that I'm sitting here
On someone else's throne
Am I sleeping with my eyes wide?
Won't you let me know?
Will I wake to find you waiting by my bedside?
Will I wake to find you waiting by my side?
Will I wake to find you waiting by my bedside?
Will I wake to find you waiting by my side?
Am I sleeping with my eyes wide?
Am I alone?
Am I following the lines on faces never shown?
Oh, I want to see your hairline and cheekbones
Your red lips and cell phone
Won't you let me know?
Will I wake to find you waiting by my bedside?
Will I wake to find you waiting by my side?
Will I wake to find you waiting by my bedside?
Will I wake to find you waiting by my side?
