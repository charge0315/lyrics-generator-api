Don't touch her there, she's blindfolded
She remembers on the bus

Into my heart
Don't remember
Like you left us
Without notice
Now you've come back
Like you left us
Like you owe us
Into my heart

It's not me, it can't be
It's not you, I can't do what I do if it's you
This is not happening

Don't touch her there, she told me
She remembers how it felt

Into my heart
Don't remember
Like you left us
Without notice

It's not me, it can't be
It's not you, I can't do what I do if it's you
This is not happening
It's not me, it can't be
It's not you, I can't do what I do if it's you
This is not happening

Come home, come home

It's not me, it can't be
It's not you, I can't do what I do if it's you
This is not happening
It's not me, it can't be
It's not you, I can't do what I do if it's you
This is not happening

Don't touch her there
He watched her
She knew his look from behind
When she came home for Christmas
