Damita Jo

Sexy, quiet, shy
But down for a good time
Taurus, my sign
Like rain but love the sunshine
Makin' headlines
Feel I'm too deep to define
Simple inside
But I'm livin' the diva life

(The Damita Jo)
Do you like me?
Do you want me?
Just for what you see?
(The Damita Jo)
Do you think that
I'm that person
You watch on T.V.?
(The Damita Jo)
There's another side
That I don't hide
But might never show
(The Damita Jo)
If you wanna get close
Baby, you can't
'Til you get to know

Friend and lover
A sista, a freak undercover
I do movies, I do dance, I do music
I love doin' my man
I wanna nasty boy to put it on me good
Miss Janet don't, but Damita sure would
A little lady, a whole lotta class
But do me wrong, I'll get in that ass

Ooh, I'm a tell your daddy
I'm a tell your mama
Yeah, girl
Sometimes you just wanna play
Sometimes you just wanna play
