FRANK:
Hey, the shark has pretty teeth, dear
And it shows them pearly white
Just a jackknife has Mac Heath, dear
And he keeps it, way out of sight
When that shark bites with his teeth, dear
Scarlet billows they begin to spread
Fancy white gloves, has Mac Heath, dear
So there's never, never a trace of red
On the sidewalk, one Sunday morning
Lies a body, oozing' life
Someone's sneaking', 'round that corner
Could that someone perhaps per chance be Mack the Knife?
From the tugboat, on a river going slow
A cement bag's dropping down
You know, that cement is for the weight, dear
You can make a large bet that bums in town
JIMMY:
(Yeah he's in town)
FRANK:
My man Louie Miller
He split the scene babe
After drawing' out all the bread from his stash
Now Mac Heath spends like a sailor
Do you suppose this guy he did something rash?
Old Satchmo, Louie Armstrong, Bobby Daron
They did this song nice, Lady Ella too
They all sang it, with so much feeling
That old blue eyes here ain't gonna add anything new
JIMMY:
(oh yes you do)
FRANK:
But with this big, fat, band jumping behind me
Swinging hard Jack
JIMMY:
(That's Jimmy)
FRANK:
I know I can't loose, When I tell you
All about Mack the Knife, babe
It's an offer you can never refuse
We've got Patrick William
Bill Miller playin' that piano
And this wonderful, great, big, band
Bringin' up the rear
All these bad cats, in this bad town
They make the greatest sound you ever gonna hear
Oh Sukey Tawdry
JIMMY:
(Oh Sukey Tawdry)
FRANK:
Jenny Diver
JIMMY:
(Jenny Diver)
FRANK:
Polly Peaches
JIMMY:
(I know her well)
FRANK:
Ms Lulu Brown
Yeah, the line forms on the right, dear
Now that Mack he
JIMMY:
(Oh Mack he)
FRANK:
Yeah that bum is back
JIMMY:
(Oh that bum he's back)
FRANK:
And I'm gonna tell you
What I think that you should know
JIMMY:
(What should I do)
FRANK:
You better lock your door
And call the law
Because Mack he
He's come back to town
Get under the bed hide
JIMMY:
(Look out old Mack is back)
