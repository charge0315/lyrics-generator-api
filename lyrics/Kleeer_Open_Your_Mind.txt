What is your fantasy, what is your fantasy?
You shouldn't keep fighting me, you shouldn't keep fighting me
'Cause I can set you free, 'cause I can set you free
I have the only key, I have the only key
Come fly along with me, port  from reality
You have to pay the bill, we'll go from A to Z

Open your mind, open your mind
Open your mind, open... your mind to me

The possibility of what you can receive
We'll take your energy, come take a chance and see
This opportunity no more will ever be
I have a recipe, you simply must believe

Open your mind, open your mind
Open your mind, open... your mind to me
Yeah, yeah

Open your mind, open your mind
Open your mind, open your mind
Open your mind, open your mind
Open your mind, open your mind
Open your mind, open your mind

Open your mind, open your mind, your mind
Open your mind, open your mind, your mind
Open your mind, mind, mind, mind...
Mind, mind, mind...
Open your mind...
