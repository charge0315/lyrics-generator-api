You touch me, girl
But don'tcha know
You can't hide
No, no, baby
When you give it up
It's only enough
To get me by

You're playin' a game
It's so plain
You want me to win
I'm willin' to play
Whatever you say
If love is the end

Playin' your game, baby
Your game, baby
Just you and me
Playin' your game, baby
Your game, baby
Nobody but you and me

You start, you stop
You know what you got
Is what I need
Oh, yes it is
When you give it up
It's only enough
To make me say
Ooo wee...

That you're playin' a game
It's so plain
You want me to win
Girl, I'll play
What ever you say
If love is the end

Playin' your game, baby
Your game, baby
Just you and me
Playin' your game, baby
Your game, baby
Just you and me
Oh, yeah

Playin' your game, baby
Your game, baby
Just you and me
Playin' your game, baby
Your game, baby
Nobody but you and me
