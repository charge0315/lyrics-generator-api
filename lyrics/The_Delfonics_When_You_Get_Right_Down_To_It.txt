When you get right down to it
Isn't this moment what it's all about, girl?
And when you get right down to it
Don't you just feel this moment's ev-everything?

Holding you, touching you
Girl, I need a whole lifetime
To do all the things
That I wanna do for you
With you, to you

When you get right down to it
Doesn't this moment wash away the bad times?
And when you get right down to it
Doesn't all the hurt you've ever felt disappear?

Holding you, touching you
Girl, I know that this magic
Just can't last forever, but then
When you get right down to it
Don't you want to live the moments

Again and again
And again and again
And again and again
And again and again?

Holding you, touching you
Girl, I know that this magic
Just can't last forever, but then
When you get right down to it
Don't you want to live the moments

Again and again
And again and again
And again and again
And again and again

For you
With you
To you
