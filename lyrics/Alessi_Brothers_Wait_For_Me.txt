I'm onto something, running 'round my head
Can't get my eyes to close at night
I've been lost, over the things you've said
And girl, sometimes it's hard to pay the cost

Oh, it's pride, pardon me
Or pass it on
Looks like compassionately
I can't hold on

Will you wait for me?
Will you always be?
Standing face to face on a night like this I wanna hear you say
(Hear you say)
That you'll wait for me
And you'll always be
I can't love you more

I'm not alone
I know you understand
Oh, and don't I get cold at times?
When the rain's- it's falling on the pain girl
Come on, open up for me
Oh, there's no guarantees, same old lies
And anyway, it means that much to me
Oh, it's only time

Will you wait for me?
Will you always be?
Standing face to face on a night like this I wanna hear you say
(Hear you say)
Wait for me
And you'll always be
'Cause I can't love you more

Hear you say

Oooh, wait for me
Will you always be?
Standing face to face on a night like this I wanna hear you say
(Hear you say)
Wait for me
And you'll always be
'Cause I can't love you more
Will you wait for me?
Will you always be?
Standing face to face on a night like this I wanna hear you say
(Hear you say)
Wait for me
And you'll always be
'Cause I can't love you more
Oh girl, girl, girl
Wait for me, love you more
Wait for me
I need to know, I need to know
I can't love you more
