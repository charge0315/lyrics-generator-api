Billy, you cool, man, with your notes?
I got mine. What's your note, man?
I got mine. Al, how 'bout you?
I'm straight, man, you know, I've been singing this for a long time
Alright, I guess we ready
Well, come on, let's sing it, man
Let's go
Ooh, ooh, ooh, woo-ooh, ooh, yeah

Sometimes it seems like I just
Can't get close enough to you
Because I love you so much

You and I are as close as two is two three
And we're growing closer together
We found that magic seed, better than love
And it will grow forever and ever

(Every day love grows) Every day love grows
(Deeper and deeper)
I just want to get inside of you
Oh, I wanna be more than a part of you
'Cause loving you the way that I do

Sometimes it seems like I just
Can't get close enough to you
Because I love you so much
Sometimes it seems like I just
Can't get close enough to you
Because I love you so much

Our love is like a house on a firm foundation
That's standing on solid ground
We build a wall of love and trust all around us
And no one can tear it down

(Every day love grows) Every day love grows
(Deeper and deeper)
I just want to get inside of you
Oh, I wanna be more than a part of you
'Cause loving you the way that I do

Sometimes it seems like I just
Can't get close enough to you
Because I love you so much
Seems like I just
Can't get close enough to you
Because I love you so much

(Every day love grows) Every day love grows
(Deeper and deeper)
I just want to get inside of you
Oh, I wanna be more than a part of you
'Cause loving you the way that I do

Sometimes it seems like I just
Can't get close enough to you
Because I love you so much
Seems like I just (Seems like I just)
Can't get close enough to you
Because I love you so much

Seems like I just
Can't get close enough to you
Because I love you so much
Seems like I just
Can't get close enough to you
Because I love you so much
Seems like I just
Can't get close enough to you
(Put a little pretty tenor in there, man, go 'head)
Because I love you so much (Woo)
Seems like I just
Can't get close enough to you
(I love this, boy, I swear I like this)
Because I love you so much
Seems like I just
Can't get close enough to you
Because I love you so much
