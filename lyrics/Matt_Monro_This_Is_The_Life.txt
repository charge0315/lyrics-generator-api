This is the life, here's where the living is
This is the life, baby, you're there
This is the life, you've waited long enough
Girl, you've arrived. Breathe in that air
Wine and perfume
Silver and candle-light
Children make way, I'm here to stay
Nothing but class, that's how its gonna be
This is the life for me
House at the beach
Dinners at 21:00
Head waiters smile when you walk in
Hand tailored suits, shirts with your monogram
Feel of real silk next to your skin
Top of the heap(?)
First cabin all the way
How sweet the song when you belong
Nothing but class, that's how its gonna be
This is the life for me
This is the life
This is the life
This is the life
