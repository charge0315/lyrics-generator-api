Walk on through the heavy storm
Walk on through the storm
Keep moving
Keep moving on
Though you can’t find your way
There will be a light
There will be a light that shines in the darkness
Keep moving on
There’s a way, there's a way
There’s a different way than you came from
There’s another way
You don’t have to go back the same way you came from
There’s a light, there’s a light
That shines in the darkest night
There’s a whisper in the silence
You may be drowning and find you can breathe underwater
There’s a whisper in the silence
There’s a secret
And it flows
And it flows
In the darkness
You can find your way
You can find your way in the darkness
The stars and the constellations know your name!
The stars and the constellations know your name!
No one is forgotten here
No one is forgotten here
And no time is wasted time
No time is wasted time
There’s always a lesson
You could be my teacher
