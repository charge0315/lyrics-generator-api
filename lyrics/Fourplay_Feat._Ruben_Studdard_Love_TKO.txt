Lookin' back
Over the years
I guess
I've shedded some tears
Told myself time
And time again
This time I'm gonna win
But another fight
Things ain't right
I'm losin' again
Takes a fool to lose twice
And start all over again
Think I'd better let it go, yeah baby
Looks like another love T.K.O
(Oh, oh, oh)
Think I'd better let it go
Let it go, baby
Looks like another love T.K.O, oh yeah
Tried to take control
Of the love
Love took control of me
'Cause you lose all thoughts
Sense of time
And have a change of mind
Takin' the bumps
And the bruises
Of all the things
Of a two-time loser
See I try to hold on
Faith is gone
It's just
Another sad song
I think
I'd better let it go
Looks like
Another love T.K.O
(One more time now)
I think
I'd better let it go
Let it go, baby
Looks like
Another love T.K.O
Oh, ho, whoa, ho
Ooh, hoo
Oh, ho, oh
Ooh, ooh yeh
And I think
I'd better let it go
Looks like another love T.K.O
(Oh my)
Think I'd better let it go
(Every time I get it forward somebody)
Looks like another love T.K.O
(t.k.o. t.k.o.)
And I think
I'd better let it go
Looks like another love T.K.O
(T.K.O. got to let it go baby)
Looks like another love T.K.O
(t.k.o)
Looks like another love T.K.O
(T.K.O. got to let it go baby)
Looks like another love T.K.O
(t.k.o)
