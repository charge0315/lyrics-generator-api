Somewhere, my love, there will be songs to sing
Although the snow covers the hopes of spring
Somewhere, a hill blossoms in green and gold
And there are dreams, all that's your heart can hold

Someday, we'll meet again, my love
Someday, whenever the spring breaks through

You'll come to me out of the long-ago
Warm as the wind, soft as the kiss of snow
'Til then, my sweet, think of me now and then
Godspeed, my love, 'til you are mine again

Someday, we'll meet again, my love
I said, "Someday, whenever that spring breaks through."

You'll come to me out of the long-ago
Warm as the wind, and as soft as the kiss of snow
'Til then, my sweet, think of me now and then
Godspeed, my love, 'til you are mine again
