Summer, Buddy Holly, the working folly
Good golly, Miss Molly and boats
Hammersmith Palais, the Bolshoi Ballet
Jump back in the alley and nanny goats
18 wheeler Scammells, dominica camels
All other mammals, plus equal votes
Seeing Piccadilly, Fanny Smith and Willie
Being rather silly and porridge oats
A bit of grin and bear it (Reasons to Be Cheerful), a bit of come and share it (Part 3)
You're welcome we can spare it, yellow socks
Too short to be haughty (Reasons to Be Cheerful), too nutty to be naughty (Part 3)
Going on forty, no electric shocks
The juice of a carrot (Reasons to Be Cheerful), the smile of a parrot (Part 3)
A little drop of claret, anything that rocks
Elvis and Scotty (Reasons to Be Cheerful), the days when I ain't spotty (One, two, three)
Sitting on a potty, curing smallpox (Why don't you get back into bed?)

Harpo Groucho Chico
Cheddar cheese and pickle, a Vincent motorcycle
Slap and tickle
Woody Allen (Reasons to Be Cheerful), Dali, Dmitri and Pascale (Part 3)
Balla, balla, balla and Volare
Something nice to study (Reasons to Be Cheerful), phoning up a buddy (Part 3)
Being in my nuddy
Saying okey-dokey (Reasons to Be Cheerful), sing-a-long a Smokie (Part 3)
Coming out of chokie
