I see the clown, he's making you laugh
Reaching your heart, turning your frown around
Gather people, Lady Divine she sings
Spread your love, give this whole world a smile
A hit parade where people come out to play
Mr. Ceremony, let the show begin!
Jamboree, jamboree
Just getting down
Get down, get on down
Get down, get on down
It's summer fun, tell all your friends to come
Oh what a time to see all your favorite stars
Happy people, life is a symphony
We're dancin' on a cloud, movin' to every beat
Celebration, gonna party today
Mr. Ceremony, let the show begin!
Jamboree, jamboree
Just getting down
Get down, get on down
Get down, get on down
Jamboree, jamboree
Just getting down
Get down, get on down
Get down, get on down
Family reunion, hot fun in summer
We're jamming, we're under the starlight
'Til the break of dawn
It's a jamboree, it's a jamboree
Jamboree, jamboree
Get down, get on down
Get down, get on down
