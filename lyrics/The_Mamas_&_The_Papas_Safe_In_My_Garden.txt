Safe in my garden
An ancient flower blooms
And the scent from its nature
Slowly squares my room;
And its perfume being such
That it's causing me to swoon
Could it be we were hot-wired?
(Safe in my garden, an ancient flower blooms...)
Late one night; we're very tired
They stole our minds and thought we've never know it
(And the scent from its nature slowly squares my room...)
With a bottle in each hand; too late to try to understand
We don't care where it lands---we just throw it
Somebody take us away...
Somebody take us away...
Safe in my garden

An ancient flower blooms
(They stole our minds and thought we've never know it...)
And the scent from its nature
(With a bottle in each hand; too late to try to understand...)
Slowly squares my room
(We don't care where it lands---we just throw it...)
(Somebody take us away...)
And it's perfume being such
That it's causing me to swoon
When you go out in the street
So many hassles with the heat;
No one there can fill your desire
Cops out with the megaphones
Telling people stay inside their home
Man, can't they see the world's on fire?
Somebody take us away...take us away...
Safe in our garden
An ancient flower blooms
And the scent from its nature...
(Cops out with the megaphones;
Tellin' people stay inside their homes.)
Man, the world's on fire.)
Slowly squares my room
Take us away...take us away...
