The energy I see
The silence that you speak
The lust within my dreams
And what it says to me
This full heart of mine
You just can't empty

So come and lay with me
China Love
How pleasant life will be
China Love
As the sun retires
Our love will transpire
Make love to me
China Love

I see the sunshine
When I look into your eyes
They speak of worlds gone by
We loved another time
My heart was empty
Till you came to be (Baby, come inside of me)

So come and lay with me (China Love)
China Love (China Love)
How pleasant life will be
China Love (China Love)
As the sun retires
Our love will transpire
Make love to me
China Love

China love
China love

(Baby, come inside of me)
So come and lay with me (China Love)
China Love (China Love)
How pleasant life would be
China Love (China Love)
As the sun retires
Our love will transpire (Baby, come inside of me)
So come and lay with me (China Love)
China Love (China Love)
How pleasant life would be
China Love (China Love)
As the sun retires
Our love will transpire

Make love to me
China Love
Make love to me
China Love
Make love to me
China Love
(China Love)
