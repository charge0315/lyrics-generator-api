Love don't bring me down
You can turn me around
Love don't lead me out
And then leave me all alone
Love don't do me wrong
I've been waiting too long
Love don't set me up
And then pull the rug away

Love can make me all better
Love can make me all right
Love can pull me together
So just make me all better tonight

Love, don't say goodbye
Leave me wondering why
Love, don't come halfway
And leave one foot out the door
Love, please let me stay
Don't you throw me away
Love, don't wring me out
And then hang me up to dry

Love can make me all better
Love can make me all right
Love can pull me together
So just make me all better tonight

La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la la, la
La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la la
La, la, la la, la
La la la, la la, la
La, la, la la, la
