"A blacksmith courted me, nine months and better
He fairly won my heart; he wrote me a letter
With his hammer in his hand, he looked so clever
And if I were with my love, I would live forever

"O, where is my love gone, with his cheeks like roses?
He is gone across the sea, gathering primroses
I'm afraid the shining sun might burn and scorch his beauty
And if I were with my love, I would do my duty

"Strange news is a-come to town, strange news is a-carried
Strange news flies up and down that my love is a-married
O, I wish them both much joy, though they don't hear me
And if I were with my love, I would do my duty

"O, what did you promise me when you lay beside me?
You said you'd marry me, and not deny me."
"If I said I'd marry you, 'twas only to try you
So bring your witness, love, and I'll not deny you."

"O, witness have I none save God Almighty
And may He reward you well for the slighting of me."
Her lips grew pale and wan; it made her poor heart tremble
For to think she had loved one, and he proved deceitful

A blacksmith courted me, nine months and better
He fairly won my heart; he wrote me a letter
With his hammer in his hand, he looked so clever
And if I were with my love, I would live forever
