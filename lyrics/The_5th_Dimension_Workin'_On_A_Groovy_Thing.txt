When I saw you I knew that
I was gonna love you
And everyday I thought
Of how I'm gonna love you
Now you're here next to me
And ecstasy is a reality
I feel good when you are near
I'm alive 'cause you are here
Workin' on a groovy thing, baby
Workin' on a groovy thing
Workin' on a groovy thing, baby
Let's not rush in, we'll take it slow
Before I met you I knew my lips
Were only wasted
'Cause you have got the sweetest kiss
I ever tasted
Music moves us along
Your arms around me are snug and warm
Happiness is in my soul
I'm about to lose all control
Workin' on a groovy thing, baby
Workin' on a groovy thing
Workin' on a groovy thing, baby
Let's not rush in, we'll take it slow
Now you're here next to me
And ecstasy is a reality
I feel good when you are near
I'm alive 'cause you are here
And we're workin' on a groovy thing, baby
Workin' on a groovy thing
Workin' on a groovy thing, baby
Let's not rush in, we'll take it slow
Workin' on a groovy thing, baby
Workin' on a groovy thing
