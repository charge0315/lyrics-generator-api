See the curtains hanging in the window
In the evening on a Friday night
A little light shining through the window
Let me know everything is alright, sing this song
Summer breeze makes me feel fine
Blowin' through the jasmine in my mind
Hear me sing, summer breeze makes me feel fine
Blowin' through the jasmine in my mind
See the paper lying on the sidewalk
A little music from the house next door
So I walk on up to the doorstep
Through the screen and across the floor
Summer breeze makes me feel fine
Blowin' through the jasmine in my mind
Sing it, summer breeze makes me feel fine
Blowin' through the jasmine in my mind, yeah
When I come home from a hard day's work
And you're waitin' there not a care in the world
See the smile a waitin' in the kitchen
Food cooking and the plates for two
Feel the arms that reach out to hold me
In the evenin' when the day is through
Summer breeze makes me feel fine
Blowin' through the jasmine in my mind
Summer breeze makes me feel fine
Blowin' through the jasmine in my mind
Here we go, summer breeze makes me feel fine
Blowin' through the jasmine in my mind
Come on, summer breeze makes me feel fine
Blowin' through the jasmine in my mind
