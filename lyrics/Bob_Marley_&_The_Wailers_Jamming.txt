Ooh yeah
Well, all right

We're jammin'
I wanna jam it with you
We're jammin', jammin'
And I hope you like jammin' too

Ain't no rules, ain't no vow, we can do it anyhow
I and I will see you through
'Cause every day, we pay the price, we're the living sacrifice
Jammin' 'til the jam is through

We're jammin'
To think that jammin' was a thing of the past
We're jammin'
And I hope this jam is gonna last

No bullet could stop us now, we neither beg nor we won't bow
Neither can be bought nor sold
We all defend the right, Jah-Jah children must unite
Oh, life is worth much more than gold

We're jammin' (Jammin', jammin', jammin')
And we're jammin' in the name of the Lord
We're jammin' (Jammin', jammin', jammin')
Look out
We're jammin' right straight from Yah
Singin'

Holy Mount Zion
Holy Mount Zion
Jah seated in Mount Zion
And rules all creation

Eh, we're, we're jammin' (Wop-chu-wa)
Wop-chu-wa-wa-wa, we're jammin' (Wop-chu-wa)
See, I wanna jam it with you
We're jammin' (Jammin', jammin', jammin')
And jammin', hope you're jammin' too

Jah knows I might have tried, the truth I cannot hide
To keep you satisfied
True love I know exist is the love I can't resist
So jam by my side

We're jammin', yeah (Jammin', jammin', jammin')
I wanna jam it with you
We're jammin', we're jammin', we're jammin', we're jammin'
We're jammin', we're jammin', we're jammin', we're jammin'
Hope you like jammin' too
Jammin', we're jammin' (Jammin', jammin', jammin')
We're jammin', we're jammin'
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna jam with you now (I wanna jam it with you)
We're jammin', we're jammin'
(Hope you like jammin' too)
And I hope you like jammin', I hope you like jammin'
(Jammin', jammin', jammin')
'Cause (I wanna jam it with you), I wanna jam it with you
I like, I hope you
I hope you like jammin' too now
I wanna jam it
Wanna jam it, ooh, ooh
