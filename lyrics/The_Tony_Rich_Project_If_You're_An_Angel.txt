Sittin' alone in my bedroom
Missin' your every touch
I smelly your perfume
My skin is warm
But it's cold in here
And every now and then
I find a strand of your hair
Remember when we cried, all night
And I saw god in your eyes
If you're an angel
Then let me fly with you
If I'm your baby
Then turn my gray skies to blue
I was so destined to have you
But sometimes I regret how deep I feel in love
'Cause I built my whole life around you
Now you're gone and my world is fallin' down
Remember when I tried to kiss you
And you said you had to leave
If you're an angel
Then let me fly with you
If I'm your baby
Then turn my gray skies to blue
There is no livin' without you here
There can be no heaven, too much to fear
What if I told you I would die
If you didn't come back in my life
If you're an angel
Then let me fly with you
If I'm your baby
Then turn my gray skies to blue
If you're an angel
Then let me fly with you
If I'm your baby
Then turn my gray skies to blue
