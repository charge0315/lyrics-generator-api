Be my
Valentine girl
Ooh

There’s not a star in the sky
That could equal to the sparkle in your eyes
This card is only one way
To let you know just how I feel

Will you be my valentine girl?
And I’ll give you my heart
Forever
Be my valentine girl
And I won’t let you go
No, never

All of the flowers I’ve sent
Could never take the place of being there
Although we only just met
You’re everything to me

Will you be my valentine girl?
And I’ll give you my heart
Forever
Be my valentine girl
And I won’t let you go
No, never

You’re everything to me
Will you be my valentine girl?
And I’ll give you my heart
Forever
Be my valentine girl
And I won’t let you go
No, never

Be my (Valentine)
My valentine
(Girl) Girl
I need you (I need you)
I want you (I want you)
I want you in my world
Valentine girl (Valentine girl)
Ooh
I’ll be there for you
Will you be there for me, too?
Valentine girl
