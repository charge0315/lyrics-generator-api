(Når den ta-ka-ta-ka-ta er borte?)
I’m dying for a cigarette in the coffee lounge
Should I ask the lady here to give me one
The only risk I’m running is a runny nose
She’s got such a bad bad cold
Oh-oh
There are no girls in here as far as I can see
Only pin-up posters sort of looking at me
Now I picture you before me here
The sound of your voice
Fondling the keys to my room
Is my accent funny?
Would you laugh at me?
Everything's uncanny so to speak
Here at the blue sky
I’m dying to be different in the coffee shop
I’ve lived on borrowed strength now my supplies are cut
I watch the television set watching me
It's asking only reading questions
On an off and in and out and down I go
I used to be confused but now I just don't know
Paper cups of coffee growing cold before my eyes
I'm somewhere in this world without a cigarette to my name
Is my accent funny?
Would you laugh at me?
Everything's uncanny so to speak
Here at the blue blue sky
Wo-ohhhh
Oohhhhh-ohhh
