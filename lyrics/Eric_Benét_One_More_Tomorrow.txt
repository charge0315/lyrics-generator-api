Last night I dreamed my life was over and done
The angels threw me high above
They called it Heaven but I know it was a lie
For when I looked, you weren't inside
If I had only one more tomorrow
I'd spend that day with you
I'd feel no pain or sorrow there with you
Last night my dream revealed
The day could soon come
Without your kiss, your touch, your love
The first tears in Heaven ever cried would be mine
Until you were there right by my side
Baby, don't you know
If I had only one more tomorrow
I'd spend that day with you
I'd feel no pain or sorrow there with you
If I had only one more tomorrow
Imagine if you could, in your arms
I'd spend my final hours, yes I would
Sometimes life makes us feel so secure
Like our days will last forever
A time will come when I am here no more
Think of me and just remember
Always remember
If I had only one more tomorrow
I'd spend that day with you
I'd feel no pain or sorrow there with you
If I had only one more tomorrow
Imagine if you could, in your arms
I'd spend my final hours, yes I would
As long as you were there, there with you
No girl, I wouldn't be afraid, there with you
Hold my hand, there with you
I love you that much, babe
I love you that much, babe
Last night I dreamed of you
