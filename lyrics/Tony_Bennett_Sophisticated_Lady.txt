They say into your early life, romance came
And in this heart of yours, burned a flame
A flame that flickered one day
And died away

Then with disillusion deep in your eyes
You learned that fools in love soon grow wise
The years have changed you somehow
I see you now

Smoking, drinking, never thinking of tomorrow
Nonchalant, diamonds shining, dancing, dining
With some man in a restaurant
Is that all you really want?

Sophisticated lady
I know you miss the love you lost long ago
And when nobody is nigh, you cry, mm

No, sophisticated lady
