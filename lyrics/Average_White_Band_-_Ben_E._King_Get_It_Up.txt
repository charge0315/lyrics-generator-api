It’s a tricky situation
Hard to say just what the outcome will be
If you saw the riddle you can save your soul
Chase love’s shadows till the river’s running cold
Hey, babe, get it up, get it up for love
Get it up, get it up for love, babe
Get it up, get it up for love
There’s a longing in the people
No one knows just when the heartaches will cease
You can free and tell her, you can stay and fight
You can stand in line and scream : ‘Hey, it’s just my right’
Hey, babe, get it up, get it up for love
Get it up, get it up for love, babe
Get it up, get it up for love
So a smile, another fallin’ star
...........................
So until we find
Just put your hand in mine, oh yeah
It’s a tricky situation
Heaven knows just where the struggle must end
If it takes forever, I’d got the time above
I won’t desert you when the tables have turned
Hey, babe, get it up, get it up for love
Get it up, get it up for love, babe
Get it up, get it up for love
Get it up, get it up for love, babe
Get it up, get it up for love
All the way for love, get it up all the way
Get it up all the way
