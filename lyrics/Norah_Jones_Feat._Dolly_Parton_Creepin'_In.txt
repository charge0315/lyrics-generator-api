There's a big old hole
Goes right through the sole
Of this old shoe
And the water on the ground
Ain't got no place else it's found
So it's only got one thing left to do

Just creep on in
Creep on in
And once it has begun
It won't stop until it's done
Sneakin' in

There's a silver moon
Came a little too soon
Oh, for me to bear
It shines brightly on my bed
And the shadows overhead
Won't let me sleep as long as it's there

Just creep on in
Creep on in
And once it has begun
It won't stop until it's done
Sneakin' in

Creep on in
Creep on in
And once it has begun
It won't stop until it's done
Sneakin' in

There's a big old hole
Goes right through my soul
Oh, that ain't nothin' new
So as long as you're around
I got no place else you've found
There's only one thing left for you to do

You just creep on in
Creep on in
And once you have begun
Don't stop until you're done
Sneakin' in
And once it has begun
It won't stop until it's done
Sneakin' in
And once it has begun
It won't stop until it's done
Sneakin' in
Sneakin' in
Sneakin' in
Sneakin' in
Creepin' in
Sneakin' in
Sneakin' in
Sneakin' in
Sneakin' in
Sneakin' in
Creepin' in
Gonna be creepin' on in
Creep
Creepin' in
