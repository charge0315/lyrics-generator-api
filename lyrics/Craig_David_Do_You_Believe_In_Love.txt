Mm, no, ah yeah

Just one day
If I could hold you in my arms
Close to my heart where you belong
Love of my life, you really are
Still be showering you with kisses like snow in winter
Remember back in the day? We were like best of friends
But we were falling in love, we never could pretend
Night after night, we used to talk about me and you
The things we'd do together forever

Do you believe in love
And the promise that it brings?
That you'll never grow apart
Well, that's what she said to me
Why did you have to go?
We were inseparable
You and me will always be together for eternity

Just one day
If I could touch your face again
Words can't describe how I'm feeling
If I could turn back the hands of time
I'd still be holding on to wishes that you left behind
Remember moments when there was nothing better than
A stroll in the park, walking hand in hand?
I'll never forget the times we talked about me and you
The things we do together forever (Whoa)

Do you believe in love
And the promise that it brings?
That you'll never grow apart (Never grow apart)
Well, that's what she said to me
Why did you have to go?
We were inseparable
You and me will always be together for eternity

(Oh) The words you said to me before you slipped away (You slipped away)
Are still with me, girl, to this very day, yeah (This very day)
In everything I do to everything I say
You'll always be the sunshine in my life
And yes, I believe in love

Do you believe in love
And the promise that it brings?
That you'll never grow apart (Never grow apart)
Well, that's what she said to me (No)
Why did you have to go?
We were inseparable
You and me will always be together for eternity, yeah
Do you believe in love? (I believe in love)
And the promise that it brings (Oh yeah)
That you'll never grow apart (Never grow apart)
Well, that's what she said to me (Oh)
Why did you have to go? (Why did you have to go?)
We were inseparable
You and me will always be together for eternity (Oh, whoa, oh yeah)
