I know how it feels to be lonely
Oh, yes, I do
And I know how it feels
To be weak and empty
I woke up this morning
You're the dream I left behind, baby
Wasn't even perfect, but I have to admit
That dream was mine, baby

I know how it feels
To be lonely
I know how it feels
To be weak and empty
I know how it feels
To be lonely
I know how it feels

I know how it feels just to say
And I, I ain't got no more tears to cry
Haven't I had enough?
Ain't this be thrilling you baby
Let's just see a man suffer
Is there some little thing I can do for you, baby, baby (Baby, baby, baby, baby)
Ain't you got no dirty dishes?
Ain't that dust there on your floor, baby?
Is there room still lеft for daddy?
Shit, I ain't gon fuss about that work no more, oh no

I know how it feels
To be sorry, sorry, sorry
And I, I'm ashamed to say that I was wrong, baby, baby

I know how it feels
To bе lonely
I know how it feels
To be weak and empty
I know how it feels
To be cast aside
I know how it feels
To be lonely
I know how it feels
