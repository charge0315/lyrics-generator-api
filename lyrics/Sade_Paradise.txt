I'd wash the sand off the shore
Give you the world if it was mine
Blow you right to my door
Feels fine

Feels like you're mine
Feels right, so fine
I'm yours, you're mine
Like paradise
I'd give you the world if it was mine
Mm-mm, feels fine
Feels like you're mine
I'm yours, so fine
Like paradise

I'd wash the sand off the shore
Give you the world if it was mine
Blow you right to my door
Feels fine

Feels like you're mine
Feels right, so fine
I'm yours, you're mine
Like paradise

Ooh, what a life
Ooh, what a life
Ooh, what a life
Ooh, what a life
I wanna share my life
Wanna share my life with you
Wanna share my life
I wanna share my life
Wanna share my life with you
Wanna share my life
I wanna share my life
Wanna share my life with you (Ooh, what a life)
Wanna share my life
Wanna share my life with you (Like paradise)
Wanna share my life
Wanna share my life with you
Wanna share my life
Wanna share my life with you
