The First Noel
The angels did say
Was to certain poor shepherds
In fields as they lay
In fields where they lay
Keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night
That was so deep

Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel

Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel

They looked up
And saw a star
Shining in the East
Beyond them far
And to the Earth
It gave great light
And so it continued
Both day and night

Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel

Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel
Israel

Born is the King of Israel
Israel, Israel, Israel, Israel
Israel
Born is the King, born is the King
Born is the King, born is the King
Born is the King, born is the King
Our finest gifts we bring
To the King of Israel
King of Kings
The first Noel the
Angels did say
Born is the King, born is the King
Born is the King, born is the King
Born is the King, born is the King
On Christmas day
