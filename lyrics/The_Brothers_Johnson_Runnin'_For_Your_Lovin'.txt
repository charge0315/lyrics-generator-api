Since we've part, our lives become a new
Searching life's long fantasies are through
Giving all we've got to give wouldn't do
You try so hard, I'll get into the mood
Now it's time to kiss and say farewell
Before I go there's something I should tell
I'll be
Runnin' for your lovin'
When you need someone
Runnin' for your lovin'
Every time I got some
Runnin' for your lovin'
Let me kiss ya' 'cause I miss ya'
Runnin' for your lovin'
I will do
Runnin' for your lovin'
If you need some affection
Runnin' for your lovin'
Point me in the right direction
Runnin' for your lovin'
Say you'll let me love you
Runnin' for your lovin'
I will do
Now you see another side of me
Wanting to still love you, can't you see?
Will you love me, kiss me, hug me, tell
Chances are we'll find each other well
I'll come running
Runnin' for your lovin'
For you lovin'
I'll come
Runnin' for you lovin'
For your love
Runnin'
I'll run so very far
Just to be right where your are
You know I'm runnnin' for your love
For you lovin'
Runnin'
To be close to you, you know it's true
That I'll squeeze you girl and love you too
For you lovin'
I'm gonna get ya'
Runnin'
A soldier man, we'll put in time, 'cause
Your love is so sweet, it won't change
For your lovin'
Runnin'
Runnin' here
Runnin' there
Runnin' everywhere, I swear
For your lovin'
Runnin'
Yow
For you lovin'
For you lovin'
I'll run so very far
Just to be right where your are
You know I'll, I'll get ya'
For you lovin'
Runnin'
To be close to you you know its true
That I'll squeeze you girl, and love you too
I'm gonna get ya'
For you lovin'
Runnin'
A soldier man, we'll put in time, 'cause
Your love is so sweet, it won't change
For you lovin'
Runnin'
Well, well, well, runnin' here
Runnin' there
Runnin' everywhere, I swear
For you lovin'
Runnin'
I'll run all over the world for you
Got to get your love
Got to get your sweet, sweet love
For you lovin'
Got to get your love
Got to get your love
