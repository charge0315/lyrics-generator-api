Doot, doot, do
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh, ohh
Do-do-do-do-do-doo
Do-do-do-do-do-doo

Every day, I hear a different story
People sayin' that you’re no good for me
"Saw your lover with another
And she’s making a fool of you," oh
If you love me, baby, you'd deny it
But you laugh and tell me I should try it
Tell me I’m a baby
And I don't understand

But you know that I’ll forgive you
Just this once, twice, forever
‘Cause baby, you could drag me to hell and back
Just as long as we’re together, and you do

I don’t want your freedom
I don’t want to play around
I don't want nobody, baby
Part-time love just brings me down
I don’t need your freedom
Girl, all I want right now is you

Doot, doot, do
Whoa-oh, oh, yeah
Do-do-do-do-do-doo
Do-do-do-do-do-doo

Like a prisoner who has his own key
But I can't escape until you love me
I just go from day to day
Knowing all about the other boys
You take my hand and tell me I'm a fool
To give you all that I do
I bet you someday, baby
Someone says the same to you

But you know that I'll forgive you
Just this once, twice, forever
'Cause, baby, you could drag me to hell and back
Just as long as we're together, and you do, oh

I don't want your freedom
I don't want to play around
I don't want nobody, baby
Part-time love just brings me down
I don't want your freedom
Girl, all I want right now is you

Doot, doot, do
(Can't you see you're hurting me)
Whoa-oh, oh, yeah
Ahh-ahh
Do-do-do-do-do-doo
Do-do-do-do-do-doo

You're hurting me, baby
Hurting me, baby
Oh, oh-oh
Di-di-dit-doot-do-do-do
Di-di-dit-doot-do-do-do
Di-di-dit-doot-do-do-do
Di-di-dit-doot-do-do-do
You're hurting me, baby
Hurting me, baby

But you know that I'll forgive you
Just this once, twice, forever
'Cause, baby, you could drag me to hell and back
Just as long as we're together, and you do, oh

I don't want your freedom
I don't need to play around
I don’t want nobody, baby
Part-time love just brings me down
I don't want your freedom
I don't want to play around
I don't want nobody, baby
Part-time love just brings me down

I don't want your (I don't want your)
I don't want your (I don't want your)
I don't want your (I don't want your)
I don't want your (I don't want your)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh
And it's up to you
To set me free
