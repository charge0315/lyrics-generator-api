She gets too hungry for dinner at eight (I'm starving)
She loves the theater, but she never comes late
I never bother with people that I hate
That’s why this chick is a tramp
She doesn't like crap games with barons and earls
Won't go to Harlem in 'iamonds and pearl
And I definitely won’t dish our dirt with the rest of those girls (Thank you)
That’s why the lady is a tramp

I love the free fresh wind in my hair
Life without care
Oh, I'm so broke, it's oke
I hate California
It's crowded and damp
That’s why the lady is a tramp (I'm a tramp)

Sometimes I go to Coney Island
Oh, the beach is divine
And I love the Yankees
Jeter is just fine
I follow Rogers and Hart
She sings every line
That's why the lady is a tramp
I love the prize fight that isn't a fake (No fakes)
And I love to rowboat with you and your wife in Central Park Lake
She goes to the opera and stays wide awake (Yes I do)
That's why this lady is a tramp

She likes the green grass under her shoes (Green grass)
What can I lose?
'Cause I got no dough Oh no?
I'm all alone when I blow out my lamp
That's why the lady is a tramp, go

Eeh-pee-pee-pee-pee-pee-pee-pee-pee-pee-pee, pee-pee
Ba-da, ba-da, ba-da, bah, bah, bah-da-bah, bah-da, bah-da-bee-day

I love your free fresh
I love your handkerchief in my hair
Life without care (Hold up)
But I'm so broke, that's oke
Hates California, it's cold and it's damp
That's why the lady is a tramp
That's why the lady is a tramp (This)
That's why the lady is a tramp
