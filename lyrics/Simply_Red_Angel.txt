Gotta find me an angel
To fly away with me
Gotta find me an angel
Who set me free
My heart is without a home
I don't want to be alone
Gotta find me an angel
In my life, in my life

Too long have I loved
So unattached within
So much that I learn
That I need somebody so
Still I'll just go on
Hoping that I'll find someone
Gotta find me an angel
In my lif, in my life

I know there must be someone, someone for me
I've lived too long without the love of someone
And there's no misery, like the misery I feel in me
Gotta find me an angel
In my life, in my life

Gotta find me
She'll be there, now don't you worry
Gotta find me
Keep looking now just keep looking
Angel
