The trees
Tenderly
The treeze
Tenderly
Then you and  in sigh were we
The shore was kissed by sea and mist
Tenderly
I can't forget when two hearts met
Breathlessly
Your arms opened wide
And closed me in..side
You took my lips you took my love
So tenderly
The evening breeze caressed the trees
Tenderly
The trembling trees embrace the breeze
Tenderly
Then you and I came wandering by
And lost in sigh were we
Your arms opened wide
And closed me in..side
You took my lips you took my love
So tenderly
