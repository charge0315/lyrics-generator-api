Sometimes it’s hard to believe
We’re still lying here after all these years
Oh, baby, when you
Start up a fight about nothing at all
In the middle of the night
Ooh, don’t tease me
Don’t say you’ll leave me
Don’t tell me there’s somewhere else
In the world you would rather be
But here with me
Baby, come back to bed
You’ll say
When you’re miles away that you miss me
You can’t live without me
Baby, when we
Argue like this I can’t kiss you
I just can’t be without you
Ooh, don’t tease me
Don’t say you’ll leave me
Don’t tell me there’s somewhere else
In the world you would rather be
But here with me
Baby, come back to bed
You haven’t really thought this through, have you?
‘Cause at the end of it all, I love you
And you love me, too
(Instrumental)
You haven’t really thought this through, have you?
‘Cause at the end of it all, I love you
And you love me too, so…
Please don’t tease me
Don’t say you’ll leave me
Don’t tell me there’s somewhere else
In the world you would rather be
But here with me
Baby, come back to bed
Baby, come back to bed
