You had your fill and now you're on your way
Searchin' for what nobody knows
You think you can go Just anywhere
And toy with any willin' soul

You play with love as though it's a game
Leavin' a string of broken hearts (Heartbeat's stoppin' oh-oh)
But soon the day will come, then you'll learn
The love that you waste
You're gonna need it
Again and again and again (You're throwing a good love away)
Oh baby, you don't know it now
You're gonna know it someday
You're throwing a good love away
Yeah, yeah, yeah
You don't know it now
You're gonna know it someday

You led me to believe that someday we would be
Walking together down the aisle (Two by two, two by two, Ooh!)
And now you'rе telling me it's all a big mistake
I'm not thе apple of your eye

Baby, you play with love as though it's a game
Leavin' a string of broken hearts
Now we're down the road
But, don't wanna love me
But soon the day will come and then you'll learn
The love that you waste, you're gonna need it
Again and again and again (You're throwing a good love away)
Oh baby, you don't know it now
You're gonna know it someday
You're throwing a good love away
I'm a good man
You don't know it now
But you'll know it someday
You play with love as though it's a game
Leaving a string of broken hearts
Uh huh, mmmhh
But soon the day will come and then you'll learn
That the love that you waste
You're gonna need it
Again and again and again (You're throwing a good love away)
Woah-woah! You don't know it now
But you'll know it someday
You're throwing a good love away
Baby, you don't know it now
But you'll know it someday
You're throwing a good love away
I know, I'm gonna miss you woman
(You don't know it now)
(But you'll know it someday)
Till your well runs dry
Girl, you're gonna cry, one day
Oohhh baby (You don't know it now)
You know life is funny sometimes
(But you'll know it someday)
The same one that said 'I love you, '
Can refuse you
Try to use you, sometime
I gotta know, will you stick with me, baby?
Woah! Hey, I know that you're a young girl
Freedom's new to your world
But honey, you're throwing a good man down the drain
A good man away... hey-hey!

Would you love me today (But you'll know it someday)
Somewhere in your future? (You're throwing a good love away)
