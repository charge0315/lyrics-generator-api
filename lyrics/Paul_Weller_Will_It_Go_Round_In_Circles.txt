I got a song it ain't got no melody
Im gonna sing it to my friends
I got a song it ain't got no melody
Im gonna sing it to my friends
Will it go round it circles
Will it fly high like a bird up in the sky
Will it go round it circles
Will it fly high like a bird up in the sky
I got a story it ain't got no moral
Let the bad guy win every once in a while
I got a story it ain't got no moral
Let the bad guy win every once in a while
Will it go round it circles
Will it fly high like a bird up in the sky
Will it go round it circles
Will it fly high like a bird up in the sky
I got a dance it ain't got no steps to it
Im gonna let the music move me around
I got a dance it ain't got no steps to it
Im gonna let the music move me around
Will it go round it circles
Will it fly high like a bird up in the sky
Will it go round it circles
Will it fly high like a bird up in the sky
