Sparks are dribblin'
Crimson gender
Jump is waxing
Feeling some improvement
Big chunk of chemistry
Falling waves of glass
Sunlight dripping ladies in my panties
Touching fingers
Mellow plate
Hurly burly
Street be brave
Wings at work
Swines above me
Daddy picked up something called it coke
Shadow noises
Blackened figs
Little voices listening to my bread
Silent blanket standing in my drawers
Gasp, Horatio spinning on a dime
Rich dude subway
Robots scratch
Pinky Hyatt
Teaching track
Breeze these things
Zebra's wine
Guild things gonna blow us all to church
Sparks are dribblin'
Crimson gender
Jump is waxing
Feeling so alive
Big chunk of scripture
Falling waves of glass
Sunlight dripping ladies in my panties
Chain links crushed
Trumpet's doing time
Sing to fountains
Assisted by a crime
Maypole something
Massa's pushy hat
Heatless microbes eating grizzly grass
Tainted trophies
Ragged misconceptions
Vanishing inventions
Dust interceptions
Disk-like memories
A floodlight futures
Carousel, a scope, and jizz
Stainless traces
X-ray faces
Threatened cigar
Cardboard zombie
Solitary cars
Pounding boys
Fascinated, beat me with the stars
Twisted subways
Robots scratch
Pinky Hyatt's
Growing fast
Breeze these things
Zebra's wine
Wandering lost like a child
Lost like a child
