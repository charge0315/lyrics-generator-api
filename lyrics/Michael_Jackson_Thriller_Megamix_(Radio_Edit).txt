She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene
I said don't mind, but what do you mean I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round
She said I am the one who will dance on the floor in the round

Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one (Oh baby)
But the kid is not my son (Woo)
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son
(Hee hee hee, no no, hee hee hee, ooh)

It's close to midnight and something evil's lurking in the dark
Under the moonlight you see a sight that almost stops you hearts
You try to scream but terror takes the sound before you make it
You start to freeze as horror looks you right between the eyes
You're paralyzed

‘Cause this is thriller, thriller night
There ain't no second chance against the thing with forty eyes, girl
Thriller (Woo hoo), thriller night
You're fighting for your life inside a killer, thriller

I said you wanna be startin' somethin
You got to be startin' somethin'
I said you wanna be startin' somethin'
You got to be startin' somethin'
It's too high to get over(yeah, yeah)
Too low to get under(yeah, yeah)
You're stuck in the middle (yeah, yeah)
And the pain is thunder (yeah, yeah)
It's too hight to get over (yeah, yeah)
And too low to get under (yeah, yeah)
You're stuck in the middle (yeah, yeah)
And the pain is thunder (yeah, yeah)

You got to be startin'
You wanna be startin'
You got to be startin' somethin' (Woo)
You wanna be startin' somethin'
Somethin' somethin' somethin' somethin'
(Hee haw)

Said na na na
(Na na na)
Na na na na
(Na na na na)
Said na na na
(Na na na)
Na na na na na
(Na na na na na)
Ah, take you there

Pretty young thing (UH)
You make me sing (AH, AH, AH, AH, AH)
Pretty young thing...

They told him don't you ever come around here
Don't wanna see your face, you better disappear
The fire's in their eyes and their words are really clear
So beat it, just beat it

Beat it (Beat it), beat it (Beat it)
No one wants to be defeated
Showin' how funky and strong is your fight
It doesn't matter who's wrong or right
Just beat it (Beat it), just beat it (Beat it)
Just beat (Beat it), just beat it (Beat it)
Ooh

AHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
AHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
AHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
