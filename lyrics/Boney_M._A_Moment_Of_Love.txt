I see a world, so full of darkness
Where love is far away
Broken dreams, the heartless
Searching for the life and the new, brighter day

So take my hand, and walk beside me
I know we'll find a way
'Cause love is out there shining
Guiding us around to a better place

And life would have no meaning
Stars wouldn't shine above
It's time we start believing
Everything can change in a moment of love

For those who cry (for those who cry)
For all the lonely (for all the lonely)
Each one (each one) along the way (along the way)
May love be yours, if only
For the time it takes for your heart to embrace

And life would have no meaning (no more, no meaning)
Stars (the stars) wouldn't shine above (wouldn't shine above)
It's time we start believing
Everything can change in a moment of love

I see a world (One moment)
So full of darkness (Moment in time)
Where love (In just a moment)
Is far away (Do what is right)
It's time we start believing
Everything can change in a moment of love
