Ahh
In between the broken skies
The rivers of our dreams
We’ve been left, running scared
Battles
To love and fight  paths
Our destiny it seems
Hidden black it
It’s only just a maybe

This is an SOS
Spelling out danger
This is an SOS
We need to come together
We’re in need of call to
So the seas of greatness
We’re in need of call to

Love be the messenger
Love be the messenger
Love be the messenger

They saw the monuments
The memories of the past
The faithfull’s   to take upon
The innocence is gone
A thousand dollars
Need a future that will last
Gotta put this  to right
Then madness can’t go on

This is an SOS
Spelling out danger
This is an SOS
We need to come together
We’re in need of call to
Say it’s bold and free advanced
We’re in need of call to

Love be the messenger
Love be the messenger
Love be the messenger
Love be the messenger

We’re in need of a change of gods
(We’re in need of a change of gods)
We need it bad and we need it now
(We need it bad and we need it now)
Our future bright’s not on the cards
(Our future bright’s not on the cards)
Link those changes make them now
(Link those changes make them now)
Precious graces to our needs
(Precious graces to our needs)
There’s nothing in this world for free
(There’s nothing in this world for free)
This home is where the hatred is
(This home is where the hatred is)
Soon you’ll be a refugee
(Soon you’ll be a refugee)

We’re in need of call to
Bold and free advanced
We’re in need of call to
Love be the messenger
Love be the messenger
Love be the messenger
Love be the messenger
Love be the messenger
