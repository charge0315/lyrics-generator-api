If I had my way, girl
I'd never leave you for a minute
But things don't always turn out
The way we want 'em to
So, while I'm away, now
I want you to remember
How much I love you
I love you, I love you

Let this love lift you up
When you're feeling blue
Wherever I go, I will be loving you
Think of me when you see
Places we once shared
Whatever I do, someday, I'll need you there
Ooh

Wherever I go, whatever I do
I'll always come home
I'll come home to you

Even though we both know
You're not in my arms
Wherever I go, you're always in my heart
Ooh, just you ask, I'll come back
Though we're miles apart
Whatever I do, I'll come to where you are
Oh

Wherever I go, whatever I do
I'll always come home
I'll come home to you
Oh, wherever I go, whatever I do
I'll always come home
I'll come home to you
Don't you worry, darling
Wherever I go, whatever I do
I'll always come home
I'll come home to you
Don't you worry, baby
Wherever I go, whatever I do
