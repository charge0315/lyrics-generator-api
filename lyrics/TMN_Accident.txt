(I really like to use cash)

She going down 'cause my trap move up just like the Jeffersons
All-black I pulled up, accident turn into incidents
How I'm gon make some money with you, you don't make no sense
Remember times when I was broke but I still had to make ends
I'm a trapaholic, dawg I'm so addicted to that cake
We pull P's outta bows now we put M's on the plate
They got checks and we got checks, but we still don't do it the same

She said you my favorite, I pull up on thе bitch, she act up then I might just trade thе bitch
I'm the type to break her down, we know you known to make a bitch
I'm a trap celebrity so your hoe swallow famous kids
I speak guapanese, you broke, I do not speak your language
You ain't tryna spin, then what you call my phone for
We been having before this rap shit, you can keep that loan bro
Quit that cap man, he just mad because his bitch chose up
My young boy walking with that flag but all my niggas poled up

She going down 'cause my trap move up just like the Jeffersons
All-black I pulled up, accident turn into incidents
How I'm gon make some money with you, you don't make no sense
Remember times when I was broke but I still had to make ends
I'm a trapaholic, dawg I'm so addicted to that cake
We pull P's outta bows now we put M's on the plate
They got checks and we got checks, but we still don't do it the same

Hop inside this foreign, shawty this is not a Mustang
She no hip, diamonds stepped on, my wrist look like cocaine
Shawty tryna stay the night, I can't let you I gotta catch this play
On westside Atlanta, my weed from the bay
Got shooters in the house and they pulling them trays
No barbershop my niggas giving out fades
Supersized Drac, everything in here deluxe
Steak and shrimp, I used to have Ramen cups for lunch
You ain't talking money dawg, you can't talk to us
I'm tied up with them knots, get loose then we gon buss

She going down 'cause my trap move up just like the Jeffersons
All-black I pulled up, accident turn into incidents
How I'm gon make some money with you, you don't make no sense
Remember times when I was broke but I still had to make ends
I'm a trapaholic, dawg I'm so addicted to that cake
We pull P's outta bows now we put M's on the plate
They got checks and we got checks, but we still don't do it the same
