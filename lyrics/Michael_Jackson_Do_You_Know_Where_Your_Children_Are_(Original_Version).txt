Father comes home from work, and he's scared to death
Mother cries for the kid, and the note she read
Father runs to the table, he says "What's going on?"
Mother cries desperately, "Our little baby's gone!"

Do you know where your children are?
Because it's now 12 o'clock
If they're somewhere out on the street
Just imagine how scared they are

She wrote that she is tired of stepdaddy using her
Saying that he'll buy her things while sexually abusin' her
Just think that she's all alone somewhere out on the street
How will this girl survive? She ain't got nothin' to eat

Save me (From this living hell)
Save me ('Cause I, I wanna heal)
Save me (I'm tired and I'm mad)
Save me ('Cause this, it ain't no joke)
Save me ('Cause I'm on the verge)
Save me ('Cause I don't wanna go)
Save me (It's time I replied)
Save me (Cause I, I want to be) (Aouw)
Save me (Hee hee, hoo hoo)

Now, she's on the move, she's off to Hollywood
She says she wanna be a star, she heard the money's good
She gets off from the train station, a man is waiting there
"I'll show you where the money is, girl, just let down your hair"
He is takin' her on the streets of Sunset Boulevard
She's sellin' her body, hah, girl, that will take you far
The police come 'round the corner, somebody there told
He's arresting this little girl, she's only 12 years old
