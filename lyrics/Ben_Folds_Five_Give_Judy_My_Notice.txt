Judy, could anyone be loved any more
Than I love you
Does it hurt you too
And Judy, I've been feeling small too long
I love you so
But something's wrong
And I come running
When you want me here
And when you want me to
I disappear, Judy
I knew if I made it easy for you
You'd settle for me
Yeah, eventually
But Judy, I can't be myself anymore
It's way too hard
Being loved by default
And I can't do this
Any longer
The vacuum left
Is so much stronger, Judy
Judy, you know I'm not mad anymore
At least most of the time
But it could take a while
And I've been living
Just to see you smile
Every once in a while
Tears fall
But that don't mean nothing at all
Just 'cause I said it first
Yeah, that's why it hurts ya
And Judy, I won't be your bitch anymore
And follow you 'round
And hold the door
And I'm not sorry
If you're not sorry
And you're not sorry
Till I make you, Judy
Judy...
Give Judy my notice
Give Judy my notice
