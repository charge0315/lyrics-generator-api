He doesn't love you, sister, this I know
Though you hang on every word he says, oh, yes
Deep down, you know it's strictly touch and go
You think you're different from the rest
Hope you know what you're doing
Hope you know what you're throwin' away
Funky love will drive you to ruin
See you gettin' closer each and every day
Broken down on the rue despair
Watching the gentry pass
You can't help wonder what the wind will bring
You should have known it wouldn't last
God, I hope you know what you're doin'
Hope you know what you're throwin' away
Funky love will be my undoin'
God, I never thought I'd live to see the day
God, I hope you know what you're doin'
Hope you know what you're throwin' away
Funky love will be my undoin'
God, I never thought I'd live to see the day
Hope you know what you're doin'
Don't you throw it away
Hope you know what you're doin'
Don't you throw it
Don't you throw it away
(Funky love)
