I don't care what you say
You can give it away
Your money don't mean much to me
I've been out on my own
Going to go it alone now
Cause that's the way it's got to be

Everybody tells me how
I can beat the odds for now
I've been standing by the fire
I just can't feel the heat
Can't feel the heat

Heartbeat
I'm looking for a heartbeat
Heartbeat
I'm looking for a heartbeat
Beating like mine

Looking at me, it's easy to see
You think you know just how I feel
Well you do me wrong
And it won't take me long
Before my restless heart will heal

I'm looking for love, a love like mine
They tell me it's so hard to find
Well I can feel it in the rhythms
The heartbeat in the streets

Heartbeat
I'm looking for a heartbeat
Heartbeat
I'm looking for a heartbeat
Beating like mine
Beating like mine
Tell me what you feel now
We've got a heartbeat
Tell me is it real now
Without a heartbeat?
Heartbeat

Heartbeat
I'm looking for a heartbeat
Heartbeat
I'm looking for a heartbeat
Heartbeat
Heartbeat
Heartbeat
I'm looking for a heartbeat
Heartbeat
I'm looking for a heartbeat
Heartbeat

Heartbeat (No matter where you're hidin' girl)
I'm looking for a heartbeat (I'll find you walkin' somewhere)
Heartbeat (My heart is beatin' for ya now)
I'm looking for a heartbeat (I'll find you walkin' somewhere)
Heartbeat (It's really beatin' for me now)
I'm looking for a heartbeat (Your heart is beatin' for me, yeah)
Heartbeat (I'll find you walkin' somewhere)
I'm looking for a heartbeat (Outside walkin' the street now)
Heartbeat (No matter where you're hidin' girl)
I'm looking for a heartbeat (I'll find you walkin' somewhere)
Heartbeat
Heartbeat
