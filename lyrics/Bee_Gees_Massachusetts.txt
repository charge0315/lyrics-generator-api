Feel I'm going back to Massachusetts
Something's telling me I must go home

And the lights all went out down in Massachusetts
The day I left her standing on her own

Tried to hitch a ride to San Francisco
Gotta do the things I wanna do

And the lights all went down in Massachusetts
They brought me back to see my way with you

Talk about the life in Massachusetts
Speak about the people I have seen

And the lights all went down in Massachusetts
And Massachusetts is one place I have seen

(I will remember Massachusetts)
I will remember Massachusetts (I will remember Massachusetts)
I will remember Massachusetts (I will remember Massachusetts)
I will remember Massachusetts (I will remember Mass-)
