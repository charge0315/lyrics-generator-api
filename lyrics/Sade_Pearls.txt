There is a woman in Somalia, scraping for pearls on the roadside
There's a force stronger than nature, keeps her will alive
This is how she's dying, she's dying to survive
I don't know what she's made of, I would like to be that brave

She cries to the heaven above
There is a stone in my heart
She lives a life, she didn't choose
And it hurts like brand-new shoes
Hurts like brand-new shoes

There is a woman in Somalia, the sun gives her no mercy
The same sky we lay under, burns her to the bone
Long as afternoon shadows, it's going to take her to get home
Each grain carefully wrapped up, pearls for her little girl

Hallelujah
Hallelujah

She cries to the heaven above
There is a stone in my heart
She lives in a world she didn't choose
And it hurts like brand-new shoes
Hurts like brand-new shoes
