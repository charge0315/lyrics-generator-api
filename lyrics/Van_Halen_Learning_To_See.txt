Time after time we
Walk past the window
And never see the ashes on the ground
Night after night
Watching the sky move
Never feel the earth spinning 'round
I didn't see you fallin'
I couldn't hear you callin'
Born with eyes wide open, never learn to see
I never meant to hurt you
Was right there cryin' with you
Why do we harm the only thing we want to be
Trying to follow
Every footstep
I feel so lost along the way
Reading the scripture
Straight from the gospel
Never understanding what they say, yeah
I didn't see you fallin'
I never heard you callin'
I got my eyes wide open, but haven't learned to see, yeah
I never meant to hurt you
Was right there crying with you
Why do we harm the only thing we want to be
I just gotta be
Me
I just gotta be
Me
Yeah
I didn't see you fallin'
I never heard you callin'
Got my eyes wide open, never learned to see, yeah
I never meant to hurt you
Was right there cryin' with you
We only cage the very thing we want to free
I just wanna be
I just wanna be
Gotta gotta be
I just wanna be
I gotta be
I wanna be
Gotta gotta
Gotta gotta be me
I just wanna be
I wanna be
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah
