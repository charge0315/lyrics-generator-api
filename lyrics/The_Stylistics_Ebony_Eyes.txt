I talk about her all day long (Talk about her all day long)
At work it seems I do things wrong
Thinking about the girl I love
My ebony eyes
She is everything a girl should be
Sometimes I find it hard to see
Why she loves a guy like me
My ebony eyes

Sweet little ebony eyes
Girl, you got me hypnotized
Talking about the girl I love
My ebony eyes
There will never be
Anyone as good for me
She's the only girl
I'll ever love
(The only girl that I'll ever love)
Ebony eyes
My ebony eyes

Sweetest little girl alive
My ebony eyes
Talking about the girl I love
My ebony eyes
Oh, loveliest girl alive
My ebony eyes
Talking about the girl I love
My ebony eyes
Oh, talking about the girl I love
