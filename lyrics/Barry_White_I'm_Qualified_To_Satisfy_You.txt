I know how to love you
I know how to do it to you
I know how to make you feel like you wanna feel
Shit, I can't lose with what I use

I'm qualified to satisfy you
Any way you want me to
Qualified to satisfy you
Any way you want me to
Qualified to satisfy you
Any way you want me to
I'm qualified to satisfy you
Any way you want me to

Sometimes you need lovin'
Morning, noon and night
Makes no difference when it is
My darling, it's alright
I'm your man and you know I can
Make you feel the way you want to
Just tell me whatever you need
And that's what I'm gonna do

I'm qualified to satisfy you
Any way you want me to
Qualified to satisfy you
Any way you want me to
I'm qualified to satisfy you
Any way you want me to
I'm qualified to satisfy you
Any way you want me to

When it comes to lovin' you
No one could love you more
There's no contest, I know I'm the best
‘Cause you're all I'm livin' for
I'm your man and you know I can
Make you feel the way you want to
Girl, just tell me whatever you need
And that's what I'm gonna do

I'm qualified to satisfy you
In any way you want me to
Qualified to satisfy-fy you
Any way you want me to
Qualified to satisfy-fy you
Any way you want me to
Qualified to satisfy you
Any way you want me to

I know, I know where it's at
You do, too
Oh, you, you do, too
Oh, you

I'm qualified to satisfy you
Any way you want me to
Qualified to satisfy you
In any way you want me to
I'm qualified to satisfy you
Any way you want me to
Qualified to satisfy you
In any way you want me to
