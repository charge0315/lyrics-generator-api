It was 1927
Had the world at my feet
A pretty girl on each arm
My family was so proud of me
I built a lot of buildings
Tore half of 'em down
One by one
They all crumbled just like me
But like a storm in a teacup
Like a smile sent down from heaven
Madge, I loved you then
And I love you now
We ate in the finest restaurants
Had the wealthiest friends
Most of them are gone now
No one left to say, "I knew you when"
It seems so long since I've remembered
The girl I used to know
She never saw any of my money
But she watched it come and go
Like a storm in a teacup
Like a smile sent down from heaven
Madge I loved you then
And I love you now
They call this place "Sunnyside"
But I ain't seen the sun
In a long, long time
And my hands don't seem too steady now
But they're still holding onto you
Madge, she's probably married now
In a nice white house
And me I just sit here in my room
Quiet as a mouse
But I got my TV turned up loud
I'm not going to hear myself retreat
If only I'd have kept her
I'd have stayed on my feet
Like a storm in a teacup
Like a smile sent down from heaven
Madge I loved you then and I love you now...
