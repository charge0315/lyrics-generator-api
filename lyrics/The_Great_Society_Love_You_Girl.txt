I love you girl
And when I go
Don't let no one say
That it isn't so
But something's calling out to me
That I don't understand
But can't refuse
And though I set my world on fire
And spread its ashes wide, you made your mark
The sounds I love to hear are being made
So it appears across the way
And now the bells are ringing loud
To call me up
To do what I must do
And trying to replace myself
I likely won't have time to think of you
I guess I'll never know what could have been
If had stayed here by your side
But still I've got to go and find out
What it is that's hurtin me inside
And when I've kissed your tears away
I'll bundle up my dreams, and say goodbye
