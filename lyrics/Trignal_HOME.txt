If you didn’t come to party, then you better go home
(Go home, go home, go home, go home...)
Yeah, get it right, she’s a pop star
Big Bully, let’s go!
Tri-Tri, where you at, baby?

Tonight, this ain’t for the bougie at all
Or the type that like to hit the club and hold up the wall
Tonight, I wanna see you with your hands in the air
When the beat drops, wanna see you shake your derriere

Tonight, it’s gonna be out of control (Wha-ah!)
Ain't trippin' on dress code
Party rock on overload
Can you hear the sound? (Sound)
Flashing lights are everywhere
Dancing like we don’t care
Put your hands in the air

It’s gon' be one, two, three o’clock, four o’clock, rock
DJ playing all the jams so the party don’t stop
Got some drink in my cup, taking me to my zone
If you didn’t come to party, then you better go home
(Ah, ah) Then you better go home
If you didn’t come to party, then you better go home
(Ah, ah-oh) Then you better go home
If you didn’t come to party, then you better go home

Tonight, we’re gonna party till a new day begins
Go to sleep, wake up and then we’re gonna do it again
Tonight, we might just do something totally off the wall
But nobody really cares 'cause we’re just having a ball

Tonight, it’s gonna be out of control (Wha-ah!)
Ain't trippin' on dress code
Party rock on overload
Can you hear the sound? (Sound)
Flashing lights are everywhere
Dancing like we don’t care
Put your hands in the air

It’s gon' be one, two, three o’clock, four o’clock, rock
DJ playing all the jams so the party don’t stop
Got some drink in my cup, taking me to my zone
If you didn’t come to party, then you better go home
(Ah, ah) Then you better go home
If you didn’t come to party, then you better go home
(Ah, ah-oh) Then you better go home
If you didn’t come to party, then you better go home

Hands in the air (Air), drink in my glass (Glass)
DJ is rocking (Rocking), we're having a blast (All night)
And nobody cares about the time
We’re gonna party all night, yeah
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)

It’s gon' be one, two, three o’clock, four o’clock, rock
DJ playing all the jams so the party don’t stop
Got some drink in my cup, taking me to my zone
If you didn’t come to party, then you better go home
(Ah, ah) Then you better go home
If you didn’t come to party, then you better go home
(Ah, ah-oh) Then you better go home
If you didn’t come to party, then you better go home
