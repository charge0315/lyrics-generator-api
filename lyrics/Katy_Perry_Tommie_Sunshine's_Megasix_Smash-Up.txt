Greetings, loved ones
Let's take a journey
Yeah

The one
Uh-huh
Baby, you're a
California girl
Let's go all the way tonight
No regrets, just love
We can dance until we die
You and I, we'll be young forever

You make me feel like I'm livin' a teenage dream
The way you turn me on, I can't sleep
Let's run away and don't ever look back
Don't ever look back
My heart stops when you look at me
Just one touch, now, baby, I believe
This is real, so take a chance and don't ever look back
Don't ever look back

I'ma get your heart racing in my skin-tight jeans
Be your teenage dream tonight
Let you put your hands on me in my skin-tight jeans
Be your teenage dream tonight
You

I know a place where the grass is really greener
Warm, wet and wild
There must be something in the water

You could travel the world
But nothing comes close to the golden coast
Once you party with us
You'll be falling in love
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

California girls, we're unforgettable
Daisy Dukes, bikinis on top
Sun-kissed skin so hot, we'll melt your popsicle
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
California girls, we're undeniable
Fine, fresh, fierce, we got it on lock
West Coast represent, now put your hands up
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

In another life, I would be your girl
We'd keep all our promises, be us against the world
In another life, I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were the one that got away
The one that got away

The one (The one)
The one (The one)
The one (The one)

In another life, I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were the one that got away

There's a stranger in my bed
There's a pounding in my head
Glitter all over the room
Pink flamingos in the pool
I smell like a minibar
DJ's passed out in the yard
Barbies on the barbecue
This a hickey or a bruise?

Pictures of last night ended up online
I'm screwed, oh well
It's a blacked out blur, but I'm pretty sure it ruled
Damn

Last Friday night
Yeah, we danced on tabletops
And we took too many shots
Think we kissed, but I forgot
Last Friday night
Yeah, we maxed our credit cards
And got kicked out of the bar
So we hit the boulevard
Last Friday night
We went streaking in the park
Skinny dipping in the dark
Then had a ménage à trois
Last Friday night
Yeah, I think we broke the law
Always say we're gonna stop-op, oh-woah

But this Friday night
Do it all again
This Friday night
Do it all again

T.G.I.F., T.G.I.F., T.G.I.F
T.G.I.F., T.G.I.F., T.G.I.F

You're so hypnotizing
Could you be the devil? Could you be an angel?
Your touch, magnetizing
Feels like I am floating, leaves my body glowing
They say, "Be afraid"
You're not like the others, futuristic lover
Different DNA
They don't understand you

You're from a whole 'nother world
A different dimension
You open my eyes
And I'm ready to go, lead me into the light

Kiss me, ki-ki-kiss me
Infect me with your lovin', fill me with your poison
Take me, ta-ta-take me
Wanna be your victim, ready for abduction
Boy, you're an alien
Your touch, so foreign
It's supernatural
Extraterrestrial

Do you ever feel like a plastic bag
Drifting through the wind, wanting to start again?
Do you ever feel, feel so paper-thin
Like a house of cards, one blow from cavin' in?
Do you ever feel already buried deep?
Six feet under screams, but no one seems to hear a thing
Do you know that there's still a chance for you?
'Cause there's a spark in you

You just gotta ignite the light
And let it shine
Just own the night
Like the Fourth of July

'Cause baby, you're a firework
Come on, show 'em what you're worth
Make 'em go, "Awe, awe, awe"
As you shoot across the sky-y-y

"Boom, boom, boom"
Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon
"Boom, boom, boom"
Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon
