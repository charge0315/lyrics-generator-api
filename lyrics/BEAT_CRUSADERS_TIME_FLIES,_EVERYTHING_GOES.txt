Time flies, everything goes...
Time flies, everything goes...
Time flies, everything goes easy!
Days we used to walk together end
Seeing you walk away over the fence
I'll recall you every now and then
Even though we'll never again
Oh baby so far, never forget what you love
Days we used to walk together end
Seeing you walk away over the fence
I'll recall you every now and then
Even though we'll never again
Oh baby so far, never forget what you love
So far, never forget what you love
Time flies, everything goes...
Time flies, everything goes...
Time flies, everything goes easy!
Time flies, everything goes...
Time flies, everything goes...
Time flies, everything goes easy!
Home town is the place
Every knows your name
Journey will remain
Everybody's hiding love deep inside
Anybody, tell me how far we'll find
Time flies, everything goes...
Time flies, everything goes...
Time flies, everything goes easy!
Time flies, everything goes...
Time flies, everything goes...
Time flies, everything goes easy!
