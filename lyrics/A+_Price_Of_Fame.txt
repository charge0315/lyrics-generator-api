Crime scene real shy in Fairfax
Victim sitting, ducking a bear trap
The facts ,black male 450lbs
Six foot three,homicide lay down
Suspects at large with impunity
Impunity means there nothing you can do to me
And the motive ,they say he to explosive
They passed it off on some east coast shit

Became all to real.rap star was killed in an early morning
Drive-by shooting

Drivers got away , no police contact
No high speed chase , investigation after that
And what's bizarre , killed wit'ch your own entourage
On the crowded street, help the camouflage
Both were shot on the passenger side
And both released albums right after they died
And both followed by agents storing the incidents
So add it up , you still say coincidence
If your still not convinced with this
Lets look further (look further)
Lets listen to the instruments
I'm figuring its JFK or Martin
Or Malcolm ,all we left with now is how come
(How come)
