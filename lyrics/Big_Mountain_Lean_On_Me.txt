Sometimes in our lives
We all have pain, we all have sorrow
But if we are wise
We know that there is always tomorrow
Lean on me when you're not strong
And I'll be your friend, I'll help you carry on
For, I know it won't be long
'Til I'm gonna need somebody to lean on
Yeah yeah yeah
Please, swallow your pride
If I have things you need to borrow
For no one can fill all of your needs
If you won't let them show
You just call on me, brother, when you need a hand
We all need somebody to lean on
Well, I just might have a problem that you'll understand
We all need somebody to lean on
Lean on me when you're not strong
I'll be your friend, I'll help you carry on
For I know it won't be long
'Til I'm gonna need, somebody to lean on
Yeah, somebody
You just call on me, sister, when you need a hand
We all need somebody to lean on
Well, I just might have a problem that you'll understand
We all need somebody to lean on
Yeah, if there is a load
You have to bear that you can't carry
Oh, just remember right up the road, and I'll share your load
If you just call me
Just call me if you need a hand
Y'gotta gotta just call me, woah, if you need a hand
Yeah, somebody just call me
If you need a friend
If you need a hand
You gotta gotta just call me
If you need a friend, yeah
Y'gotta gotta just call me
