Morning brings the song of steeples
Ringing in my ears
Quiet rain calls to all the people
Rain to come and wash away the tears
And I been jivin' in your alleyways
And lookin' for a better way thru
Jesus and the devil
God and man
Who will be the master
When our cities turn to sand
Well then my friends
Will you take my hand?
And Esmaria, won't you please come home?
Things have been so strange since you been gone
But if its goodbye forever, then let your heart ride a feather
To a better time
Come on home to me
Leaving the cocoon cradle
Reaching for a star
Breathing in the joker's fable
Make me wonder who we really are
Don't you wonder who we are?
Bring it home
Lay down your stones, come on
Bring it home
Lay down your stones, bring it home
Lay down your stones
Come on
Bring it home
