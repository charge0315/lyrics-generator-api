Hey, Amanda
Where'd you find these crazy boys this time?
They say you're pretty but you don't think they're right
Hey, Amanda
While you're staring at your telephone tonight
Do you feel like turning it off, turning off all of the lights?
Pin your wings down
If it's over now
Pin your wings down
Just take a chance, somehow
Hey, Amanda
Who just stole your heart away this time?
And when you're crying on your bed, does he help keep you alive?
Pin your wings down
If it's over now
Pin your wings down
Just take a chance, somehow
I'll take the blame if you take me home now
'Cause there's no place left for trust in all this pain
And you know when it rains in this town
I get washed away without a sound
So pin my wings down
If it's over
If it's over now
If it's over
If it's over now
Pin your wings down
If it's over now
Pin your wings down
Just take a chance, somehow
Pin your wings down
If it's over now
Pin your wings down
Just take a chance, somehow
