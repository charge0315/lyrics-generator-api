Escape (Ow!)
Escape (Ow!)
Escape

Everywhere I turn, no matter where I look
The system's in control, it's all ran by the book
I've got to get away, so I can free my mind
Escape is what I need, away from electric eyes
No matter where I am, I see my face around
They pin lies on my name, then push them town to town
Don't have a place to run, but there's no need to hide
I've got to find a place, but I won't hide away

Escape (Escape)
I gotta get away from a system
Loose in the world today
Escape (Escape)
The pressure that I face from relationships
Had to go away
Escape (Escape)
The man with the pen that writes the lies that hassle this man
Escape (Escape)
I do what I wanna 'cause I gotta face nobody but me
Escape

I tried to share my life with someone I could love
But games and money is all she ever thought of
How could that be my fault when she gambled and lost?
I'm tired of silly games, it's time to make a change

Why is it I can't do whatever I want to? (Oh)
When it's my personal life and I don't live for you (You)
So don't you try to tell me what is right for me
To be concerned about you, I can't do what I want to

Escape
I gotta get away from a system
Loose in the world today
Escape (I got to get away)
The pressure that I face from relationships
Had to go away (Don't you know I need it)
Escape
The man with the pen
That writes the lies that hassle this man (I got to get away)
Escape
I do what I wanna 'cause I got to face nobody but me
Escape (Get away)
Escape
I got to get away from a system (Don't you try it)
Loose in the world today
Escape
The pressure that I face from relationships
(Pressure that I'm facing every day)
Had to go away
Escape
The man with the pen
That writes the lies that hassle this man (Come on now)
Escape
I do what I wanna 'cause (Come on now)
I got to face nobody, but me
Escape

When I go
This problem world won't bother me
This problem world won't bother me
Yeah, oh, yeah (Ooh)

Escape
I gotta get away from a system
Loose in the world today (I will fly away)
Escape
The pressure that I face from relationships
Had to go away (Pressure that I'm facin')
Escape
The man with the pen
That writes the lies that hassle this man (Writin' all those lies)
Escape
I do what I wanna (Escapin', 'cause I do just what I wanna)
'Cause I got to face nobody but me
Escape (Yeah, yeah)
I gotta get away from a system
Loose in the world today (Away)
The pressure that I face from relationships
See, I got to get away
Escape (Yeah, yeah)
The man with the pen
That writes the lies that hassle this man
Escape
I do what I wanna (Do just what)
'Cause I gonna face nobody but me

I got to feed my mother
Oh, feed my mother
I gotta get away (Escape)
The pressure that I face from relationships
Had to go away (Take it no more)
Escape
The man with the pen
I can't take this garbage here no more (Escape)
I do what I wanna ('Cause you're a liar)
'Cause I got to face nobody but me
Escape
Escape
