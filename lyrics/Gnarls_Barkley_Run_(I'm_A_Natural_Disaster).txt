Yeah, it's still the same, can't you feel the pain?
When the needle hits the vein, ain't nothing like the real thing
I've seen it once before and, oh, it's something else, good God
Cool breeze, come on in; sunshine, come on down
These are the teardrops of a clown, the circus is comin' to town
All I'm sayin' is sometimes, I'm more scared of myself, you better (Move)
I said (Move)

(Ah!) Run away
(Ah!) Run away
(Ah!) Run, children
(Ah!) Run for your life
(Ah!) Run away
(Ah!) Run away
(Ah!) Run, children
(Ah!) Oh
Here it comes, said run
(Ah!) Alright

Yeah, I'm on the run; see where I'm comin' from?
When you see me comin', run before you see what I'm runnin' from
No time for question askin', time is passin' by, alright
You can't win, child, we've all tried to
You've been lied to, it's already inside you
Either you run right now or you best get ready to die, you better (Move)
I said, (Move)
Ooh, good Lord

(Ah!) Run away
(Ah!) Run away
(Ah!) Run, children
(Ah!) Run for your life
(Ah!) Run away
(Ah!) Run away
(Ah!) Run, children
(Ah!) Oh
Here it comes, said run
(Ah!)

Hurry, little children, run this way
I have got a beast at bay
Promise me when the chance comes (Run away)
You'll run as fast as you can (Run as fast as you can)
Don't you dare look backwards (Don't look back)
Run as fast as you can (Run as fast as you can)
(Ah!) La la la, la la la
(Ah!) La la la la
(Ah!) La la la, la la la
(Ah!) La la la, la la la
(Ah!) La la la la
(Ah!) La la la, la la la

(Ah!) Run away
(Ah!) Run away
(Ah!) Run, children
(Ah!) Run for your life
(Ah!) Run away
(Ah!) Run away
(Ah!) Run, children
(Ah!) Oh
Here it comes, said run
(Ah!)
