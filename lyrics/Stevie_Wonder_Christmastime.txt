It's Christmas time and its magic is here
It's Christmas time and its wonders appear
The scent of pine fills the Christmasy air
While the church bell chimes and there's joy everywhere

Some precious gift (Some precious gift)
Lights a little one's eyes (Light's a little one's eyes)
God's blessed lived (God's blessed lived)
Stays the weary and wild (Stays the weary and wild)

This Christmas time, keep its magic right here
Within your heart every day of the year

Some precious gift
Lights a little one's eyes
God's blessed lived
Stays the weary and wild

This Christmas time, keep its magic right here
Within your heart every day of the year
