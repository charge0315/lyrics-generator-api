Ooh...
Baby, baby, it's a dream here with you
Alright (Don't do it)
Alright
Don't say it's over
Don't say goodbye
Just come on over
And we'll talk about it, you and I (You and me)
I won't try to tell you
When our love has gone
No one can tell me
There's good in cryin'
What's the use in trying
Or the need to carry on (Carry on, carry on)
Love's sweet sensation (Got a hold of me)
Love's sweet sensation
Love's sweet sensation (Got a hold of me)
Love's sweet sensation
Love's sweet sensation
Love's sweet sensation
Love's sweet sensation
Love's sweet sensation
Love's sweet sensation (Sweet)
You sho'nuff got it, sho'nuff got it
Sho'nuff got a sweet hold on me (Got a hold of me)
Love's sweet sensation
Yeah, sho'nuff got a hold of me
I tell you what
You that bird that's better than two in the bush
Yummy, yummy, yummy, you're so good to the tummy
Ey, I like your hair
Love's sweet sensation

So sweet
You're so sweet
Love's sweet sensation
Oh, for me
I'm all for you too, baby
Get down for me, baby, baby

Love's sweet sensation
Sweet
Sweet
I feel that sensation comin' on
Love's sweet sensation
I mean it's done gotten serious
 Very
Oh, shucks
