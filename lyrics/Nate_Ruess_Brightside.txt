Why'd you take the long way home?
I watched you walk slow past my window
Is that what you did it for?
I think it's best you left me alone
You know I'm bound to make you cry
From up here I can see the Carlyle
I can see the Louvre shining in your eyes
I never meant to set the world on fire
Just wanted something you'd remember me by

But now I wish that I was on the bright side
These friends of mine could spend the whole night dreaming
While you're holding me tight under the moonlight
Just you and I, we'll lead a new life singing
La la la
La la la
La la la
La la la

You know, I think it says a lot
That I could wake myself up from this dream
Grab the things that are most dear to me
And although I could have loved you better
I had to get the fuck out of the bed
Cause there's just something about you my love
Something in the way you comb your hair
And fall apart at the seams
When you were young I used to throw you down
You'd show me how it feels to feel

Oh God, I wish that I was on the bright side
These friends of mine could spend the whole night dreaming
While you're holding me tight under the moonlight
Just you and me, babe, we'll spend our whole lives singing
La la la
La la la
La la la
La la la

And look at you
And look at you
And look at you
And look at you
