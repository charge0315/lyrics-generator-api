You're in love
And you're wondering what's on my mind
Do you stand a chance to make me yours
Is it just a waste of your time
You don't ever have to feel that way
'Cause I'll be here to stay (here to stay)
No
You won't have to tell me goodbye
You won't have to tell me goodbye
Now that love has opened my eyes
Don't say goodbye
(Child)
When you loved
I just pushed your love to the side
Took advantage of the way you felt
Kept your love high up on a shelf
Let me prove I've got a change in me
I found it here with you (here with you)
No
(You won't have to tell me goodbye)
Not when our love can go on
(You won't have to tell me goodbye)
And I want you so, and I realize
For now that love has opened my eyes
Don't say goodbye
You don't ever have to feel that way
'Cause I'll be here to stay (here to stay)
No
(You won't have to tell me goodbye)
Not when our love can go on
(You won't have to tell me goodbye)
And I want you so, stay here by my side
For now that love has opened my eyes
Don't say goodbye
