Ooh, oh, yeah
Oooh, Lord
(Here)

How beautiful are you?
There's more than a thousand replies
Could it be your lips or your golden eyes?

When I think of an answer
That's when I get so surprised
Another wonder of the world, realized
That's why

I just don't want you here
I just don't want you near me, baby, no
'Cause I'm scared I'll cry and love you like crazy
Flying above all fears
I haven't seen any tears, not lately
(No, no)
I don't want to land, not even maybe

How desperate am I?
I wonder if you are what keeps me alive
Alone I can't get as high, even though I've tried
Oh

It's different when you're grown
The wine don't taste the same when you're alone
The size of the bed now seems like the biggest that I've ever known
Oh

I just don't want you here
I just don't want you near me, baby, oh no
'Cause I'm scared I'll cry and love you like crazy
But I'm flying above all fears
(So high)
I haven't seen any tears, not lately
(No, no)
I don't want to land not even maybe

There's so much more for you and me to explore
Ooh baby baby
When you walk through that door
I am gonna give you what you waited for

Listen baby, let me break this down
I am going to say this once
Then I am going to leave this town
If you can learn to open your eyes under water
Then you and me won't drown without each other
I promise I'll see you on the other side
If you just believe in me and trust this ride
The quickest way, baby
You and me, sincere
Right now, I just don't want you here
(I don't, here, I don't, here, I don't want...)
I just want you here
(don't make me want you)

I just want you here
I just want you near me, baby
I'm scared I'll cry and love you like crazy
I'm flying above all fears
(So high)
I haven't seen any tears, not lately, no
I don't want to land, not even maybe
Here

Don't listen to me, no
I just need you here
Oh, Lord
I just want you here
I just want you, want you here
Donny Hathaway's "Song For You" ain't the same without you
Here
