Lookin' at the devil, grinnin' at his gun
Fingers start shakin', I begin to run
Bullets start chasin', I begin to stop
We begin to wrestle, I was on the top

I want to thank you for lettin' me be myself again
Thank you for lettin' me be myself again

Stiff all in the collar, fluffy in the face
Chit-chat chatter tryin', stuffy in the place
Thank you for the party, but I could never stay
Many things on my mind, words in the way

I want to thank you for lettin' me be myself again
Thank you for lettin' me be myself again

Dance to the music all night long
Everyday people sing a simple song
Mama's so happy, mama start to cry
Papa still singin', you can make it if you try

I want to thank you for lettin' me be myself again (Different strokes for different folks, yeah)
Thank you for lettin' me be myself again

Flamin' eyes of people fear burnin' into you
Many men are missin' much, hatin' what they do
Youth and truth are makin' love, dig it for a starter
Now, dyin' young is hard to take, sellin' out is harder

Thank you for lettin' me be myself again
I want to thank you for lettin' me be myself again
Thank you for lettin' me be myself again
Thank you for lettin' me be myself again
I want to thank you for lettin' me be myself again
I want to thank you for lettin' me be myself again
I want to thank you for lettin' me be myself again
I want to thank you for lettin' me be myself again
I want to thank you for lettin' me be myself again
I want to thank you for lettin' me be myself again
Thank you for lettin' me be myself again
Thank you for lettin' me be myself again
I want to thank you for lettin' me be myself again
I want to thank you for lettin' me be myself again
I want to thank you for lettin' me be myself again
I want to thank you for lettin' me be myself again
I want to thank you for lettin' me be myself again
I want to thank you for lettin' me be myself again
