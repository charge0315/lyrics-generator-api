And here's to you, Mrs. Robinson
Jilly loves you more than you will know
Woah, woah, woah
Oh, bless you please, Mrs. Robinson
Heaven holds a place for those who pray
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey

We'd like to know a little bit about you for our files
We'd like to help you learn to help yourself
Look around you, all you see are sympathetic eyes
Stroll around the grounds until you feel at home

The PTA, Mrs. Robinson
Won't okay the way you do your thing
Ding, ding, ding
And you'll get yours, Mrs. Robinson
Foolin' with that young stuff like you do
Boo, hoo, hoo
Woo, woo, woo

So how's your bird, Mrs. Robinson?
"Dandy", Mrs. Robinson, you'd say
Hey, hey, hey
Well, have you heard, Mrs. Robinson?
Mine is fine as wine, and I should know
Ho, ho, ho
Oh, bless you please, Mrs. Robinson
Heaven holds a place for those who pray
Hey, hey, hey

Mrs. Robinson
Keep them cards and letters coming in, Robbie baby
