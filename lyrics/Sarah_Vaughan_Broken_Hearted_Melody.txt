Broken hearted melody
Once you were our song of love
Now you just keep taunting me
With the memory of
His tender love, oh

Broken hearted melody
Must you keep reminding me
Of the lips I long to kiss
And the love I miss since he went away?
Night and day they play

That broken hearted melody
That he used to sing to me
When our love was young and bright
As he held me tight
Suddenly I found
I was heaven bound

Broken hearted melody
Once you were our song of love
Now you just keep taunting me
With the memory of
His tender love, oh

Broken hearted melody
Won't you bring him back to me?
Sing to him until he yearns
For when he returns no more will he be
A broken hearted melody
