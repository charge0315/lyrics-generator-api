Why does the sun go on shining?
Why does the sea wash to shore?
Don't they know it's the end of the world?
'Cause you don't love me any more
Why do the birds go on singing?
Why do stars glow above?
Don't they know it's the end of the world?
It ended when I lost your love
I wake every morning and I wonder
Why's everything the same as it was
I can't understand
No, I can't understand
How life goes on the way it does
Why does my heart go on beating?
Why do these eyes of mine cry?
Don't they know it's the end of the world?
It ended when you said goodbye
Why does my heart go on beating?
Why do these eyes of mine cry?
Don't they know it's the end of the world?
It ended when you said goodbye
