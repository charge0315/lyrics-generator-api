Won't you dig a little deeper
And overcome the pain in your bleeding fingers?
Who knows, you might find some treasure
Or something strange that belongs to none other
Most of the time, you work hard for nothing
And no one sees or they don't give a damn
No, you don't need the validation
Just scratch the surface then you'll know exactly where you are
It's here and you're alone and it's okay
You're doing nothing wrong
It's here and you're alone and it's okay
You're doing nothing wrong
Open it up, do you what are you waiting for?
Just skip the first step, take it straight to the next
It'll always be a solitary bizness
But at least it gives you some peace of mind
It's here and you're alone and it's okay
You're doing nothing wrong
It's here and you're alone and it's okay
You're doing nothing wrong
It's here and you're alone and it's okay
You're doing nothing wrong
It's here and you're alone and it's okay
You're doing nothing wrong
It's here and you're alone and it's okay
You're doing nothing wrong
It's here and you're alone and it's okay
You're doing nothing wrong
It's here and you're alone and it's okay
You're doing nothing wrong
It's here and you're alone and it's okay
You're doing nothing wrong
It's here and you're alone and it's okay
You're doing nothing wrong
It's here
