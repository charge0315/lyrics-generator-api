Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Mmm, nah
Mmm, yeah

Well, I let go of the world that was holding
A passenger that could not fly
In search of souls
In search of somethin'
Let it go and let it slide
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ooh oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

When I find out what went on
I'll bring it back, but it won't be easy
They won't believe how a man,  he could drown
In a starseed, starseed
Oh-oh, oh-oh

I hoped to find why the world wasn't glowing
It's darker as we end this ride
I've fallen back under the equator
We're back inside, we're back inside
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Mmm, so real
Ooh oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

When I find out what went on
I'll bring it back, but it won't be easy
They won't believe how a man, he could drown
In a starseed, starseed
Oh-oh, oh-oh

It's all or nothing, nothing
But I found out what went on
I'll bring it back, but it won't be easy
They won't believe the man, he could
But I'd choose starseed over nothing, nothing
But I found out what went on
I'll bring it back, but it won't be easy
They won't believe the man, he could
But I'd choose starseed over nothing, nothing. nothing
Mmm, alright
Starseed over
Starseed over
