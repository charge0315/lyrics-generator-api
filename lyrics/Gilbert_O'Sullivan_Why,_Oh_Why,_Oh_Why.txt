Why is it you must be so very cruel to me
In order to be kind
Why when I hold you close
Do you insist your toes
Are being stood on by mine
Why when I kiss your lips
Do you astound me
Saying that you won't put
Your arms around me
No one should be that cold
What ever ive done
Surely ive a right to know
Oh why oh why oh why
Why is it ev'ry time we
Visit friends of mine
You never want to go why
When I'm feeling good
You act as if I should be
At an all time low
Why after all these years
Weve been together
Must you behave as if we'd hardly ever
Spoken let alone met it seems that you're
Happy as long as I'm upset
Oh why oh why oh why
Is it that you don't love me oh why
Have you just had enough of me
Oh why do I always have to cry
Mvself to oo sleep seven days a week
La la la la la la la...
Why in the name of God
Are you so angry
Could it be that you can
No longer stand me tell me and i will go
You're breaking my heart
Just in case you didn't know
Oh why oh why oh why
