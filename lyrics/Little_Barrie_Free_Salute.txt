Hook a little trick right past the sleeve
Because the truth just can't be told
Looking for the passport that you need
To stop the truth from breaking your soul
Better leave no clues
To tell him where the hell you been
You know it's only late or soon
Before the truth starts rushing in, yeah
Better keep your head down while you wait
You wanna keep yourself alive
Put a single out ball at the gate
Then drag your head right up the drive, yeah
Better leave no clues
To tell him what the hell you want
You know it's only late or soon
Before the truth starts hitting home, yeah!
Well if it's sentiments that you want
Is there anything that I can do?
You got a sunrise but you don't
Quit looking for a free salute
Better leave no clues
To tell him what the hell you want
You know it's only late or soon
Before the truth starts rushing in
Yeah, well if it's sentiments that you want
Is there anything that I can do?
You got a sunrise but you don't
Quit looking for a free salute
Yeah, be my enemy
Yeah be my enemy
Yeah, is there anything that I can do?
You got a sunrise but you don't
Quit looking for a free salute
