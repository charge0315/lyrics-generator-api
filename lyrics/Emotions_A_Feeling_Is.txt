You know it's just a feeling
A feeling is a feeling
A feeling is a thing you can be sure of
Even if it's singular or plural
No matter what kind or mood of
You'll only know the real true meaning
You don't have to tell anybody what's keeping you in a way, whatever the day
Whether it stays or go away, no
A feeling is a thing you just can't finagle
It takes more than a rhyme or a riddle
It's a matter of control over a lot or a little
Just keep in mind, will power is a virtue
Use it, you'll find you'll need no one to nurse you
When you pursue, you only accrue
What's coming to you
It's true, it's true
It's true, it's true
Others will see you're a much better person
And it may seem they're just like a merchant
'Cause you will have the gift they've been searching for
And much, much more, much more
A feeling is
(A feeling is)
A feeling is
(A feeling is)
A feeling is
You know it's just a feeling
A feeling is a feeling
A feeling, oh
(A feeling, oh, a feeling is)
A feeling is
(I said a feeling is, I said a feeling is)
A feeling is
(Somethin' precious)
A feeling is
(Somethin' special)
A feeling is
(Ooh, remember this is a feeling)
(Never, never, never, never, never)
A feeling, oh
(A feeling, ooh)
A feeling is
A feeling is
A feeling is
A feeling is
(A feeling is tender, warm, precious)
A feeling, oh
(Never turn your back on a feeling)
(Never, never, never, never, never, never)
A feeling is
