I can't strain my brain, I know how it feels to worry all the time
I can't take the pain, I know how it feels to worry over just a dime
Yes, pleasure was made for us to see
That we're gonna have to be free
Keep on runnin', when you feel her pullin' back, you goin' strong
Don't stop runnin', if you're real, you'll never slack, you got to go on
Yes, pleasure was made for us to see
That we're gonna have to be free
Can't strain my brain when I feel somebody tryin' to bring me down
Mmm, won't take the rain, don't you know you'll never catch me lyin' down?
Can't bust a man if he feels to make it easier to see
Can't trust a man when that trust should take the lovin' out of me, yeah
Yes, pleasure was made for us to see
We're just gonna have to be free
Can't strain my brain
Can't take the rain
Damn this pain
Do you know my name?
