Time did it take for his mind to be made
There were songs in the night
The songs in the night
Marked by the bread
Up the stairs, dipped in red
There were songs in the night
The songs in the night sang

Ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah

You make my heart break
You make my heart break, love

Chosen, they fled
By the fire one said
Something's wrong with your eyes
You were wrong, something's wrong here
Alone, yes, alone
He was born to be stoned
That His father would strike
And His song in the night sang

Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah

You make my heart break
You make my heart break, love
You make my heart break
You make my heart break

The voice of the crowd
Overcame every sound
Every cry was in vain
That would rise to His aid
"Let Him fall, let Him break
Let us bury the name
Of this Son to be slain"
And the song that they sang cried

Ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah

I'll take your heartbreak
Even your heartbreak
I'll take your heartbreak
Even your heartbreak
I'll take your heartbreak
Even your heartbreak
