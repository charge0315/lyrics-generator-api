One love, one heart
Let's get together and feel alright
Hear the children cryin' (One love)
Hear the children cryin' (One heart)
Sayin', "Give thanks and praise to the Lord and I will feel alright"
Sayin', "Let's get together and feel alright, woah-woah-woah-woah"

Let them all pass all their dirty remarks (One love)
There is one question I'd really love to ask (One heart)
Is there a place for the hopeless sinners
Who has hurt all mankind just to save his own beliefs?

One love (What about the one heart?), one heart (What about the—)
Let's get together and feel alright (As it was in the beginning)
One love (So shall it be in the end), one heart (Alright)
Give thanks and praise to the Lord and I will feel alright
Let's get together and feel alright, one more thing

Let's get together to fight this Holy Armagiddyon (One love)
So when the Man comes, there will be no, no doom (One song)
Have pity on those whose chances grows thinner
There ain't no hiding place from the Father of Creation, singing

One love (What about the one heart?), one heart (What about the—)
Let's get together and feel alright (I'm pleadin' to mankind)
One love (Oh, Lord), one heart (Woah)
Give thanks and praise to the Lord and I will feel alright
Let's get together and feel alright
Give thanks and praise to the Lord and I will feel alright
Let's get together and feel alright
