Don't you ever change your mind
Don't you ever be unkind
To me some say that
(You're a fool)
Well, I'm not
You might think that I'm a fool but I'm not
If I take you to a dance
Don't let me catch you holding hands
With other boys they think I'm cruel
Well, I'm not
You might think that I'm being cruel but I'm not
It's worth a little thought to think of how I fought for you
Even so you know I caught for you
Every bad dream you had and threw them away
There'll come a day when I know you will say
All the things I said to you were the best things too
So don't you ever change your mind
And don't you ever be unkind
To me some say that
(You're a fool)
Well, I'm not, no, no, no, no
You might think that I'm a fool, but I'm not
It's worth a little thought to think of how I fought for you
Even so you know I caught for you
Every bad dream you had and threw them away
There'll come a day when I know you will say
All the things I said to you were the best things too
So don't you ever change your mind
And don't you ever be unkind
To me some say that
(You're a fool)
Well, I'm not, no, no, no, no
You might think that I'm a fool, but I'm not
I'm not quite finished yet
I'm not quite finished yet
I nearly am you understand
But I'm not quite finished yet
There's another side to go before I go
Thought I'd let you know
Thought I'd let you know
