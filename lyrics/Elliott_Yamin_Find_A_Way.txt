A child is born not knowing a thing
The pride and joy of momma's eyes
A teenage boy knows next to nothing
And yet he's called away to kill or die
The life we live for some is easy
And most of us just make it by
My mother worked so hard to feed me
It's a wonder how she never lost her mind
The rain is falling from the sky
It's getting harder to stay dry
They say that pride goes before a fall
Heaven help us all
If love don't find a way
I turned the news on just this morning
Proclaiming all things justified
If war is one side of the story
Does it make sense for us to choose a side?
And when the end comes God forgive me
For everything I've said and done
If living is the price to be free
Then I wish it was the same for everyone
Rain is falling from the sky
It's getting harder to stay dry
They say that pride goes before a fall
Heaven help us all
If love don't find a way
Skat
Oh, we've got to find a way
Oooh
For everyone
Oooh
They say that pride goes before a fall
Heaven help us all
If love don't find a way
Yeah, yeah
They say that pride goes before a fall
Heaven help us all
If love don't find a way
Oooh
Skat
