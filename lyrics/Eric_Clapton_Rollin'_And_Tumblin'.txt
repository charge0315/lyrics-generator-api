Well I roll and I tumble
I cried the whole night long
Lord, I rolled and I tumbled
I cried the whole night long
When I woke up this morning
I'd best keep rollin' on

Come here, baby
Sit on your daddy's knee
I said come here, baby
Sit on your daddy's knee
I got something to tell you
That's been worryin' me

Well now, meet me in the bottom
Bring me my runnin' shoes
Well now, meet me in the bottom
Bring me my runnin' shoes
When I come out the window
I won't have time to lose

Well I hope you see me
When I come runnin' by
I said I hope you see me
When I come runnin' by
She got a bad old man
You know I'm too young to die
