Written by Jean Frankfurter (Music)
I'm living on a mountain
I'm the highest girl in town
Honey Honey
Come to see me, honey
You take the elevator
All the way up to the crown
Honey Honey
Come to see me, honey
Bring along your friends
We do a very special show
Honey Honey
Come to see me, honey
Whenever you're feeling
Lonely
You know what to do, you
Only
Have to give me a call
You'll have a ball
* (Repeat 2 times and fade)
