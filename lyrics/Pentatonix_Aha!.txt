Eat, sleep and breathe it
You're full of the stuff
Go back and tie up tight
Wheat-meat-dairy-free, teetotal, happy-clappy
High on life, you should try it
You should know (You should know, you should know)
Go on while no one's looking

A-ha! Caught you now! (Caught you now)
Caught you red handed in the biscuit tin!
Cost you to keep me quiet

La la la la, la la la la
La la la la, la la la la
La la la la, la la la la
La la la la la

Golden boy boots
Pocket pedestal
Making sharp, smart moves
Plastic, tin can, paper, separated
Busy bee wave, wave 'Save The Planet' flag
But sneaky in suburbia

A-ha! Candid camera!
Hook the line and sinker
For a four-wheel drive
Cost you to keep me quiet!
Keep me quiet! (keep me quiet)

Nicest, sweetest, utmost in everything
It's so charming, very charming
Well, reckon play the fool
No one's ill at ease
And put their deepest Swiss bank trust in you
No one saw it coming

Cost you to keep me quiet

La la la la, la la la la
La la la la, la la la la
La la la la, la la la la
La la la la la
Hey!
