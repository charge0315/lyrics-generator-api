You seem to be wanting
Everything yesterday
Always the impossible
That's what you seem to portray
Give me one good reason
Why, even if I stay
You won't walk away from me
Tomorrow today
You seem to be wanting
Everything yesterday
Why, all of a sudden
Are you acting in this way
Leave me as you found me
Astound me no more
Who cares what today's like
The morning before
Did you ever stop to ask him
Where he's going
Has it not occurred to you
Without you knowing
You're reducing me to no more
Than a wreck
I cannot stand the pace you're keeping
What's you're meaning
