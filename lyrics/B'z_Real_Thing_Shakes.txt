Can't fall asleep, (I) don't know why
I know it's not 'cause of the world situation
Watchin' TV, bad news all around
But that's not the reason why I'm so scared now

Real thing shakes me like the rain in a storm, woah
Something's burnin' like a fire in my mind
Love sets me free like a bird in the sky, woah
You and me, we can find a way to fly

Lots of trouble in the country
Leaders changin' day after day
But it don't matter, don't care about it
I just want you to get closer to me

Real thing shakes me like the rain in a storm, woah
Something's burnin' like a fire in my mind
Love sets me free like a bird in the sky, woah
You and me, we can find a way

I got something I need to say, woah
Ooh, you can believe me

Oh, you know I'm changing
Oh, I can tell you, I've been achin'
Who's cryin', who's cryin' now?
Don't wanna lose you, don't wanna turn away

Real thing shakes me like the rain in a storm, woah
Something's burnin' like a fire in my mind
Love sets me free like a bird in the sky, woah
You and me, we can find a way to fly
Real thing shakes me like the rain in a storm, woah
Something's burnin' like a fire in my mind
Love sets me free like a bird in the sky, woah
You and me, we can find a way to fly
