I've been knowin' you, you've been knowin' me
But I ain't took the chance to tell you what I want
Girl, it's been too long, and I can't go on
Can't be actin' like I don't care

'Cause I rolled with you, I grew up with you
My momma used to sit you when your moms weren't home
Always friends with you, never stepped to you
But now it's time that I start makin' love to you

Time passes by for more than a lifetime
I wanna be yours, girl
I would give up my life
To spend just one night with you
'Cause my love don't stop
I can't lie, you bring out the best in me
I gots to be yours. girl
I would give up my life (Ooh, oh)
Theres nothin' that I won't do
'Cause my love don't stop

There's a part of me that wants us to be
Just the way we are so we don't mess things up
But it's killing me (oh)
'Cause the rest of me (Yeah)
Wants to feel your body, baby
Wants to tear it up

(I'll do some things to you no one else can do)
'Cause, baby, I'm the one to make you feel real good
(Being friends is cool) Being friends is cool (No one stepped to you)
'Cause now it's time that I start makin' love to you

Time passes by for more than a lifetime (Oh yeah, for more than a lifetime)
I wanna be yours, girl
I would give up my life (My life, baby)
To spend just one night with you (Ooh-woo)
'Cause my love don't stop (Love don't stop)
I can't lie, you bring out the best in me
I gots to be yours. girl
I would give up my life (My life, baby)
Theres nothin' that I won't do
'Cause my love don't stop

I've been loving you so long
I know it can't be wrong
'Cause there's never been no one but you
And girl, there never will (Love don't stop, no)
Seeing you with other guys tears me up inside
Girl, I've watched you get hurt too many times
But I can make you, all I can do
Is show you how I'm gonna love you

Time passes by for more than a lifetime (Oh)
I wanna be yours, girl (I wanna be yours, baby)
I would give up my life (Oh, oh yeah)
To spend just one night with you (Ooh-woo)
'Cause my love don't stop
I can't lie, you bring out the best in me (I cannot, baby)
I gots to be yours, girl (You bring out the best in me, baby)
I would give up my life (I wanna be yours, baby)
Theres nothin' that I won't do
'Cause my love don't stop

It just don't stop, baby (No, no, no)
My love don't stop
It goes on and on, babe
It just don't stop, baby (No, no, no)
My love don't stop
Girl, my love don't stop
It just don't stop, baby (No, no, no)
My love don't stop
It goes on and on, babe
It just don't stop, baby (No, no, no)
My love don't stop
