And I mean everything that I say
I’m not here to play play
I don’t really hear the whole thing
I just need you for one hoe for a day
Yeah

I want to love you till’ you know my bedroom
I want to hug you like you is my bed sheets
I’m willin' to travel across the world
Just for a little five minute meet
And I’m coming dripped down in designer
I wear all Louis V, this not Tan-Tique
And I never saw nobody that’s finer
But my heart so cool, got stepped on by ten feet
We never did nothing, but you showed me your body, ooh girl don’t tempt me
But you showed me your body, yеs you showed me your body
Can’t love this hard
(I wanna love you)
If this don’t work I swеar my God
If this don’t work, hope I won’t be apart (I wanna love you)
If we get married, everyone they will applaud
Gangsters all in my reception
Crib so big, it got reception
She want to love me, I say “aw”
She just want me for protection
She said I’m her best selection
She on a jet, so we just textin’
She so young, I’m gone' be her first lesson
And ple-e-e'ase, don’t judge me on my past
Don’t judge me on my cash
You think I only want them girls that come with that ass
You say my lifestyle so fast
Both make analogy, I’m rich gang
And you a real girl, and it’s just the same
The way we correlate, you know I’m not perfect and I ain’t fake
See your boyfriend respect me, that’s how I know he lame
Cause if I was him I would prolly try to take my chain
I’m just tryna see if you just want this ring
Pink diamond oh, oh, in this ring
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(I wanna love you)
I wanna love you
I wanna touch you
Make sure that you comfortable
Make sure that I’m loving you the same way, that’s going through your brain, yeah
I wanna love you more than a dopehead love dope
Love you more than a cokehead love coke
Love you more than a hygienic just love soap
I don’t need no drugs, when I met you, you my cope
For you baby, I’m jumping right there off the ropes
Titanic love, I would jump right off the boat
Your shoes cost more than a new coupe
So if I see a pedal I take off my coat (Off my coat)
