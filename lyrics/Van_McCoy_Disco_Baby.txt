Dance, dance, dance, disco baby
Shake, shake, shake, disco baby
Get down, get down, get down, disco baby

Ever see a room start a-rockin'
Ever see the ceilin' fall?
Ever see a dance floor burning up from wall to wall?

Disco baby, disco baby
When she grooves, she makes the moves that drive you crazy
That's my disco baby
Freakin' out the discotheque

Dance, dance, dance, disco baby
Shake, shake, shake, disco baby

When they play a real bad record
And the beat is really cool
Everybody claps their hands and watches you know who

Disco baby, disco baby
When she grooves, she makes the moves that drive you crazy
That's my disco baby
Freakin' out the discotheque

Dance, dance, dance, disco baby
Shake, shake, shake, disco baby

Disco baby, disco baby
When she grooves, she makes the moves that drive you crazy
That's my disco baby
Freakin' out the discotheque

Dance, dance, dance, disco baby
Shake, shake, shake, disco baby
Get down, get down, get down, disco baby
Dance, dance, dance, disco baby
Shake, shake, shake, disco baby
Get down, get down, get down, disco baby
