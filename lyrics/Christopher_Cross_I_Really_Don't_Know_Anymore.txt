What do you think about love
Is it a game to be played
To be torn and lost in the wilderness
To be lost
And lonely after all

What do you think about love
Is it a way to be saved
To feel the warmth of another love
Just to be lost
And lonely after all

I really don't know anymore (I really don't know)
I really can't say (I really can't say)
I really don't know anymore (I really don't know)
I'm just that way

What do you think about love
Is it a game to be played
To keep your heart and have never loved
To be lost
And lonely after all

What do you think about love
Is it a way to be saved
To give up your heart to another love
To be lost
And lonely after all

I really don't know anymore (I really don't know)
I really can't say (I really can't say)
I really don't know anymore (I really don't know)
I'm just that way

I really don't know anymore (I really don't know)
I really can't say (I really can't say)
I really don't know anymore (I really don't know)
I'm just that way
(I'm just that way)
I'm just that way

I really don't know anymore (I really don't know)
I really can't say (I really can't say)
I really don't know anymore (I really don't know)
I'm just that way
