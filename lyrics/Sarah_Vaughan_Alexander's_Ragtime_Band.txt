Come on and hear, come on and hear, Alexander's ragtime band
Come on and hear, come on and hear, it's the best band in the land
They can play a bugle call like you never heard before
So natural that you want to go to war
That's just the bestest band what am, oh my honey lamb
Come on along, come on along, let me take you by the hand
Up to the man, up to the man, who's the leader of the band
And if you care to hear the Swanee River played in a ragtime
Come on and hear, come on and hear, Alexander's ragtime band
Come on and hear, come on and hear, Alexander's modern band
Come on and hear, come on and hear, it's the best band in the land
They can boo be doo ye, doo de doo de, doo yen doo de
That's just the bestest band what am, oh my honey lamb
Come on along, come on along, let me take you by the hand
Up to the man, up to the man, who's the leader of the band
And if you care to hear the Swanee River played in cool time
Or if you want to hear the Swanee River played in a ragtime
Come on and hear, come on and hear, Alexander's ragtime band
Be doo den doo be, de de doo be, doo ben doo, Alexander's ragtime band
