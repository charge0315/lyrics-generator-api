'm switched on and twisted, so hung up in my life
I feel nihilistic, automatic tonight
Caught up in the middle, a mental wasteland
It hurts just a little, nobody understands
Automatic, stuck on automatic, automatic, stuck on automatic
A kid he was gifted, lost it all in one night
He turned on, he missed it, he was warped, he was wired
Heard a steel tapdance, staccato double time
Rhythm was the answer, any groove was fine
Automatic, stuck on automatic, automatic, stuck on automatic
(Solo)
Automatic's on time, when nothin' else will fit
In a corner you try, you can't get out of it
Wear the mask you creature, cause a major scene
No one saw you leave here, cut it loose and clean
Automatic, stuck on automatic, automatic, stuck on automatic
Automatic, stuck on automatic, automatic, stuck on automatic
