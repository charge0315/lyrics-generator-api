Well, I guess this is it, babe
Reality has hit home hard
No need in puttin' it off anymore
Just turn away and let me walk out the door
You thought you had it all figure out
But baby, you don't know what love's about
It's time for me to spend some time alone
Tired of tryin' to make this your happy home

(Hurt) I'm leavin'
(Time) This time it's for good
You should have treated me
The way you said you would
(Hurt) I'm leavin'
(Time) And you can't make me stay
I'm tired of hurtin' you
This ain't no good any way
I'm leavin'

I know it's gonna be hard on you
Once it really hits you that I'm gone
I spent too much time tryin' to make things right
When I really knew all along
You'll be okay in time, baby
But it won't be today, no
As you walk around tryin' to find yourself
Take a look at the bed you've made

(Hurt) I'm leavin'
(Time) This time it's for good
You should have treated me
The way you said you would
(Hurt) I'm leavin'
(Time) And you can't make me stay
I'm tired of hurtin' you
This ain't no good any way

(Hurt me so) I'm leavin'
(Time to go)
(Hurt me so)
(Time to go) I'm leavin'
I'm leavin' (Hurt me so)
I'm leavin' (Time to go)
Said I'm leavin', baby
I'm leavin', baby
(Hurt me so)
(Time to go)
(Hurt me so)
(Time to go)
