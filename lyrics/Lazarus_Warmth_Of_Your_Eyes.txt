Time after time
I feel the warmth of your eyes
And see you flate down your desgize
And you're free
To Be
Just what you are
To me
And it's time after all the years we played
Our endless game of shraits
Don't you lie
It's the best time
Of your life
And when we're living in the holy trate of Jesus
I can look into your eyes
And you in mine
We eill know
And maybe show
He didn't live in vain
Time after time
I found the warthm of your eyes
I've come to realize
Just how to love you
It's the best time
Of my life
