Hmmmmmm
Ooooooooh
Sometimes I sit and I wonder
And I just can't seem to believe
What a blessing it's been to be loved
You're an angel sent to me
You're the star who lights up my sky
You're the one who made me see
That you don't need wings to fly
Your love has set me free
Cause you are the one who makes me whole
In my heart and in my soul
And just like the sun you showed my the light
I'm amazed and you're the reason why
Before you I was so blind
I didn't know which path to choose
You poured all of this love in my heart
And there's no way that I can lose
And when I have no faith in myself
You're the one who makes me strong
I wouldn't have a story to tell
Or an ending to my song
Cause you are the one who makes me whole
In my heart and in my soul
And just like the sun you showed my the light
I'm amazed and you're the reason why
Oooohh you're the reason why
Oh ooooooooh
You are the one who makes me whole
In my heart and in my soul
Just like the sun you showed my the light
I'm amazed and you're the reason why
Cause you are the one who makes me whole
In my heart and in my soul
Just like the sun you showed my the light
I'm amazed and you're the reason why
You are the one who makes me whole
In my heart and in my soul
And just like the sun you showed my the light
I'm amazed and you're the reason why
Hmmmmmmmm Ooooooh
