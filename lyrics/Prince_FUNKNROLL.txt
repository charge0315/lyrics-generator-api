Oooh
Let, let, let
Oooh

So finally, beloved, we meet at last
Middle of the here, never mind the past
Only way to get to where you never been
Is party like you ain't gonna party again

Let's funk, let's roll
Get it turned up, get it out of control
Getting to the rhythm is good for the soul
Let's funk (That's right), let's roll (Yeah, baby)
Get it turned up, get it out of control
Come on everybody, let's funknroll

Whether you're coming by bus or a train
Shade throwers hating, 'cause they're going insane
Million-dollar party, to their nickel and dime
Another mother further you're committing a crime

Let's funk, let's roll, hey baby
Get it turned up, get it out of control
Getting to the rhythm is good for the soul
Let's funk (Yessir), let's roll (My, my)
Get it turned up, get it out of control
Come on everybody, let's funknroll

The only way to last 'til the break o' dawn
Put your phone down, get your party on
Who you gonna call when it's obvious, dear?
Everybody you know is rockin' in here

Let's funk (C'mon), let's roll (Let's roll, baby baby)
Get it turned up, get it out of control
Gettin' to the rhythm is good for the soul
Let's funk, let's roll
Get it turned up, get it out of control
Come on everybody, let's funknroll
Oh yeah, yeah
Woo woo woo
Oowee, oowee

I don't really care what y'all be doin'
Come on, come on
Let's go, let's go
Oh no, you didn't
I don't really care what y'all be doin'
