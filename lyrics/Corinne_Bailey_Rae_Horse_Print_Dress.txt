I wear my horse print dress
And though my hair’s still wet
You kiss me on my neck
I haven’t told anybody yet
We spend our days and night
Lying by firelight
And your pretty eyes, looking at me so bright
Like I’m your one delight
You’ve got me spinning, spinning out
Don’t think that I can let go now

Baby
I’m tickled with your love
I’m flying
Spin this kaleidoscope round
’cause I don’t want to come down

I wear my lipstick pressed
Maraschino cherry red
And we wear our hair a mess
‘Cause we just got out of bed
This isn’t my first romance
But it hit me like an avalanche
I tried to talk about it on the phone
But you’re so different from the ones I’ve known
Ooh, you’ve got me spinning
I don’t think I can let go now

Baby
I’m tickled with your love
I’m flying
Spin this kaleidoscope round
’Cause I don’t want to come down
How can I just let you go?
When I don’t want to come down
Spin this kaleidoscope round

What you give
What you get
What you give
What you get
What you give
What you get
What you give
Oh, I can't let you go

And baby, I’m tickled with your love
I'm flying
I don't want to come down
Don't think I'll ever come down
Ahh, ahh
I'm flying
I don't want to come down
Don't never let me come down
