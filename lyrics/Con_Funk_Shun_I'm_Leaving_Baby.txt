Ooh...
Ooh-ooh-ooh, oh, baby
Oh, baby, sweet baby
Ooh-ooh-ooh...
So it's late night after all, baby
You've finally made it home
Since 9 o'clock this morning
I've been waiting by the phone
Gee, your make-up's kinda special
And you're looking mighty good
You said we'd do some talkin'
And now I think, that we should
You're gonna see all the pain you're causing me
I've seen enough, I'm giving up
I'm giving up love now, baby
You won't find another love as strong as mine
I've seen enough, I'm giving up, I'm giving up
Girl you say you love me
And I'm the one to blame
Said you're always thinking of me
Well, it's too bad, baby, you'll never change
And you won't find
Another love as strong as mine, no, darling
I've seen enough, I've given up
I'm giving up on ya, baby
And you won't see
Another man quite like me, no, darling
I've seen enough, I've given up
(Oh, baby)
I've given up sweet darlin'
Ooh, baby, I've seen enough
I'm leaving ya, I'm leaving you for me
I'm leaving all my keys at home
I'm leavin', baby, I'm leavin' you for me
Ooh-ooh...
And you won't find
Another love as strong as mine, no, darling
I've seen enough, I'm giving up
I'm giving up love now, baby
Ooh-ooh, and you won't see
Another man quite like me, no, darling
I've seen enough, I've given up
(Oh, baby, oh, baby)
I've given up, sweet darling
Ooh, baby, I've seen enough
Believe me now, I'm leaving you for me
I'm leaving all my keys at home
(Oh, it's over baby)
I'm leavin', baby, I'm leavin' you for me
Ooh, baby, I've seen enough
Believe me now, I'm leaving you for me
I can't take all this pain no more
(It's over, baby)
I'm leavin', baby, I'm leaving you for me
Ooh, baby, I've seen enough
I'm leaving, baby, I'm leaving you for me
Ooh, baby, my heart is sore
(Oh, it's over, baby)
I'm leavin', baby, I'm leaving you for me
Oh, baby, I've seen enough
Believe me now, I'm leaving you for me
Sweet darling, our love is through
(Oh, it's over baby)
I'm leaving ya, I'm leaving you for me
