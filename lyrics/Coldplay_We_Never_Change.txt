I wanna live life and never be cruel
And I wanna live life and be good to you
And I wanna fly and never come down
And live my life and have friends around

We never change, do we? No, no
We never learn, do we?

So I wanna live in a wooden house
I wanna live life and always be true
And I wanna live life and be good to you
I wanna fly and never come down
And to live my life and have friends around

We never change, do we? No, no
We never learn, do we?

So I wanna live in a wooden house
Where makin' more friends would be easy
Oh, and I don't have a soul to save
Yes, and I sin every single day

We never change, do we?
We never learn, do we?

So I wanna live in a wooden house
Where making more friends would be easy
I wanna live where the sun comes out
