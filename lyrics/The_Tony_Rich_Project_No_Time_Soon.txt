I used to think that life was so bad
That livin' wasn't so good
But time, it changed my mind
And my soul falls in line
I'm not ready to leave your side
In no rush to give up on life
I'm not ready to paint the room
I don't wanna die, no time soon
Depression ruled my sight
And nights alone were quite an experience
Bu over course, you'll find
A happy side of your life
I'm not ready to leave your side
In no rush to give up on life
I'm not ready to paint the room
I don't wanna die, no time soon
When you find that you're lonely
Seems like nobody is on your side
You take your time to pray to heaven
You'll find your only reason
Is so that you live your life
I'm not ready, to leave your side
In no rush to give up on life
I'm not ready to paint the room
I don't wanna die, no time soon
I'm not ready, to leave your side
In no rush to give up on life
I'm not ready to paint the room
I don't wanna die, no time soon
