Your life is a story
I've already written
The news is that I am in control

And I have the power
To make you surrender
Not only your body but your soul

Tomorrow never dies, surrender
Tomorrow will arrive on time
I'll tease and tantalize with every line
Till you are mine
Tomorrow never dies

Whatever you're after
Trust me, I'll deliver
You'll relish the world that I create

Tomorrow never dies, surrender
Tomorrow will arrive on time
I'll tease and tantalize with every line
Till you are mine
Tomorrow never dies

The truth is now what I say
I've taken care of yesterday

Tomorrow never dies, surrender
Tomorrow will arrive on time
I'll tease and tantalize with every line
Till you are mine
Tomorrow never dies
Tomorrow never dies
Tomorrow never dies
