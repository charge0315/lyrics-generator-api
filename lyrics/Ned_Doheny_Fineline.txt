Fineline
Tell me where does the money go
Long shots
I've played a lot of those
Ooh I wish that we could move
With one accord
There are those who might ask
Who can all afford
To cover such a fineline
Such a fineline
This old God damn dough
Break your heart on
Think you owe
Fineline
Tell me how is it gonna be
Will they stone you
Or will they set you free
You can say you knew it all along
But you take your chances
You figure wrong
Don't you know it's such a fineline
Such a finеline
This old God damn dough
Break your heart on
Think you owе
Say no
Sweet thing I want to know for sure
Is the comment
Am I without a cure
Hey there's a man outside
Who says he knows me well
But he won't speak freely
So how do you tell
Said he'll call me by the fineline
Ooh, such a fineline
Living takes its toll
Sweet or salty, how do I cope
Such a fineline
Oh baby, such a fineline
Oh baby, such a fineline
Such a fineline...
