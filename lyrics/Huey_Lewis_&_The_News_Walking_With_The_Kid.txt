We're going out on Sunday Afternoon
We're gonna show the world what were made of
Me & my buddy will be dressed to kill
We'll cruise to the playgroung & the park
Gonna fool aroung 'til it gets dark
If you think we'll have some fun well you know we will
All of oursecrets
You know we're gonna keep 'em hid
When we get home they'll wanna know
Everything we did
Walking with the kid
Walking with the kid
We're known around the neighborhood
Yeah we got a real reputation
The bad guys all respect us 'cause we're family
We're not afraid of anything at all
Cause we can handle any situation
If my partner gets in trouble well it's up to me
All our friends are envious
Though they'll never let it show
Sure enough later on
Everyone's just gotta know
What we were
What we did
Walking with the kid
Walking with the kid
Walking, talking one on one
Walking, walking with my son
