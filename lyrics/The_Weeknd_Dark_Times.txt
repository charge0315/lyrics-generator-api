Wakin' up, half-past five
Blood on pillow and one bruised eye
Drunk too much, you know what I'm like
But you shoulda seen the other guy

This ain't the right time for you to fall in love with me
Well, baby, I'm just bein' honest
And I know my lies could not make you believe
We're runnin' in circles, that's why

In my dark time, I'll be goin' back to the street
Promisin' everything I do not mean
In my dark time, baby, this is all I could be
And only my mother can love me for me
In my dark time
In my dark time

Light one up, let me bum a smoke, uh
Still comin' down, drippin' throat, uh
I got another man's blood on my clothes
But it ain't his fault, it's the life I chose

This ain't the right time for you to fall in love with me
My baby, I'm just bein' honest, uh
And I know my lies could never make you believe
Runnin' in circles, that's why

In my dark times, I'll be going back to these streets
Promising everything I do not mean
In my dark times, maybe this is all I could be
Only my mother could love me for me
In my dark times
In my dark times

In my dark times, I've still got some problems, I know
Drivin' too fast but just movin' too slow
And I've got something I've been tryin' to let go of
Pullin' me back every time

In my dark time, takin' it back to the street
Makin' those promises that I could not keep
In my dark times, baby, this is all I could beOnly my mother could love me for me
In my dark time, takin' it down to the street
Makin' those promises that I would never keep
In my dark time, this is all I could beOnly my mother could love me for me
In my dark times
In my dark time
In my dark times
