I like it when you dance for me, hallelujah
Oh, funky congregation
Let us bow our heads in prayer
(You)
And thank the Almighty for you, baby
(Thank you, thank you)
Glory, glory, hallelujah
I like it, I like it
I like it when you dance for me

I like it when you dance 'cause it gets me hot
I like it when you shake everything you got
I like it when you dance 'cause it's so sexy
I like it when you dance for me
I like it when you think I'm all alone
You're the voice I hear on the telephone
Telling me all your deepest fantasies
I like it when you dance for me, hallelujah

I like it when you dance for me
I like it when you dance for me

I like it when I hear a knock on my door
You are standing there in your Christian Dior
Dark sunglasses in the pale moonlight
I like it when the scene is right (Oh oh)
You can take your wrap and lay it on the chair
If anybody finds it, I don't care
What we do together makes history
I like it when you dance for me, hallelujah

Oh oh, I like it when you dance for me
Oh, I like it when you dance for me
Dance, dance, dance. dance for me
Dance, dance
I like it when you dance for me

Your flamenco eyes are all like jazz
With every other sip of what's in your glass
The sexier you get
The more you into my stash
I like it when you dance for me
Hallelujah
I like it when you
Dance for me
I like it when you dance for me

You don’t need directions, and you don’t need cash
From your Jimmy Choo’s to your ultra lash
Least that I can do, baby, is get half
It’s worth it when you dance for me!
Hallelujah
Now dance
Dance for me
Now dance
Dance for me

I like it when you dance 'cause it gets me hot
I like it when you shake everything you got
I like it when you dance 'cause it's so sexy
I like it when you dance for me
(Say it again)
I like it when you dance 'cause it gets me hot
I like it when you shake everything you got
I like it when you dance 'cause it's so sexy
I like it when you dance for me
Hallelujah

Oh lady, shake it now
Make me wanna (I like it when you dance for me)
Make me wanna pick up maracas and just shake
I like it when you dance for me
I like it when you dance for me
Dance
Dance
I like it when you dance for me
I like it when you dance for me
