Wake with the sun
What's going on
When you're gone?
Fall asleep
When you're near
What's going on
When you're here?

And sometimes I think if I stand by the phone it may ring
And sometimes I worry and fear what tomorrow may bring
And you sing, and you sing

Breathe with your sigh
Makes me high
Don't know why
Touching your skin
Wishing you
Were within

Your eyes are like saucers but mine are just clouded in gray
I've so much to tell but I can't and you just go away
Anyway, won't you stay?

Oooh
Oooh
Oooh

Wake with the sun
What's going on
When you're gone?
And when I lost control
I was cold
And I felt old

The ground is beneath me but slowly it's falling away
You say we're like children, so why won't you come out and play?
And sometimes I think if I look at the phone it may ring
And sometimes I worry and fear what tomorrow may bring
When you sing, when you sing

Oooh
Oooh
Oooh
Oooh
