It's gonna cause you sorrow
It's gonna give you all you need
Forget about tomorrow
Don't dramatize the things you did
It quickly flows to the sea
So quickly you won't see
So many things to face
And you're still in the wrong place
It's easy if you try
Don't emphasize the things inside
It quickly flows to the sea
So quickly you won't see
It's time to say goodbye
Put on your swimming suit
And then we will dive
