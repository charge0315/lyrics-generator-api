Mm (Watch me)
Hey (Woo)
One, two, three (Watch me; uh)

I woke up with all this sunlight
Ain't got time to listen to any shade, yeah
Uh, the wind in my pony, top-down, alright
Ain't got time to let them darken my day, that's right

Uh, so light the fireworks
Sing like no one's there
Dance, it's us against the world, oh

(Ooh-ooh) They don't know, they don't know, they don't know
They don't know about us
(Ooh-ooh) They don't know, they don't know, they don't know
About what we do, that it's true
I could have all this, but I'm good if I got you
(Ooh-ooh) They don't know, they don't know, they don't know
They don't know about—

(Woo) Mm
Listen (Watch me; uh)

You wait so long to catch that feelin'
So hold onto it for as long as you can, yeah
We could run away to only where we know
Boy, I got plans, hey

Uh, so light the fireworks
Sing like no one's there
Dance, it's us against the world, oh

(Ooh-ooh) They don't know, they don't know, they don't know
They don't know about us
(Ooh-ooh) They don't know, they don't know, they don't know
About what we do, that it's true
I could have all this, but I'm good if I got you

They don't know about—
