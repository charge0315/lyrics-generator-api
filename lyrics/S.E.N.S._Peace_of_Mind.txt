Where you dey go
Make I dey know
I want to know
Make I dey follow you go
Make I dey follow you
Been on a low
Been on the road
I need someone, to help me take control
To take control
If it’s peace of my mind you need, you’ll find it
You’ll find it
If it’s happiness you need, you’ll find it
You’ll find it
If you’re looking for that peace of mind you’ve found it
And the lightning that we spark you know it’s shining
All these glasses that they’re wearing cause we’re blinding
He said he wan be close to my belly
Said he’s coming home to me tonight
Somеbody’s here to hold me tight
Hеre to hold me tight
Said he wan be close to my body
Said he’s coming home to me tonight
Somebody’s here to hold me tight
If it’s peace of my mind you need, you’ll find it
You’ll find it
If it’s happiness you need, you’ll find it
You’ll find it
