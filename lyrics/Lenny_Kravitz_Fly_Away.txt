I wish that I could fly
Into the sky, so very high
Just like a dragonfly
I'd fly above the trees
Over the seas, in all degrees
To anywhere I please, oh

I want to get away
I wanna fly away, yeah, yeah, yeah
I want to get away
I wanna fly away, yeah, yeah, yeah

Let's go and see the stars
The Milky Way or even Mars
Where it could just be ours
Let's fade into the sun
Let your spirit fly where we are one
Just for a little fun, oh, oh, oh, yeah

I want to get away
I wanna fly away, yeah, yeah, yeah
I want to get away
I wanna fly away, yeah, yeah, yeah

I gotta get away
Girl, I gotta get away
Oh, oh, oh yeah

I want to get away
I wanna fly away, yeah (With you), yeah, yeah, oh yeah
I want to get away
I wanna fly away, yeah (With you), yeah, yeah, I gotta get away

I want to get away, I want to get away
I want to get away, I want to get away, yeah!
I want to get away
I wanna fly away, yeah (With you) yeah, yeah
Girl, I gotta get away
I want to get away, I want to get away
I want to get away, I want to get away, yeah!
I want to get away
I wanna fly away, yeah (With you) yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
