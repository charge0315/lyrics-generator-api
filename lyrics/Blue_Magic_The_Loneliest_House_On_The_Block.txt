I can't forget when you were mine
Such a love was hard to find
I introduced you to a friend
Then our love came to an end
I'm left in a place that we call love
Folks know that I'm here all alone
In
 X2
The loneliest house on the block
Where the windows are closed
And the doors are always locked

I'm on the inside looking out
At a world that full of doubt
Life used to mean so much to me
Now you've gone and set me free
I watch the street from end to end
Waiting for the day to let you in to...
 X2
The loneliest house on the block
Where the windows are closed
And the doors are always locked
I watch the street from end to end
Waiting for the day to let you in to...

The loneliest house on the block
Where the windows are closed
And the doors are always locked
The loneliest house on the block
(Can't you see my heart is breaking)
Where the windows are closed
And the doors are always locked
Wish that you could see me waiting
