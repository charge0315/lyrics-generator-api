Here I am and I been thinkin' about you lately
Hold my hand cause I've been missin' you like crazy

Don't wanna go through life every single night
Wishing we could do it, oh, but do it right
Come and hold me tight, we don't need to fight
Rather spend my life with you, every night
'Cause baby...

This bed is too lonely without you (Baby)
Don't wanna hold my pillow, I wanna hold you
Please be beside me, these king-size sheets
Need more than just a queen in between 'em
This bed is too lonely without you (Too lonely)

So why don't we go inside where we can be together?
You mean more than anything
Stay with me, wanna be with you forever

Don't wanna go through life every single night
Wishing we could do it, oh, but do it right
Come and hold me tight, we don't need to fight
Rather spend my life with you, every night
Ooh baby...

This bed is too lonely without you (Baby, baby, baby)
Don't wanna hold my pillow, I wanna hold you (I wanna hold you, hold you)
Please be beside me, these king-size sheets
Need more than just a queen in between 'em (Yeah)
This bed is too lonely without you (Too lonely)

You know when it starts to get late
And it's time to go to sleep, I, I don't know what to do
'Cause I don't wanna hold my pillow
I wanna hold you

Don't wanna go through life every single night
Wishing we could do it, oh, but do it right
Come and hold me tight, we don't need to fight
Rather spend my life with you, every night
Ooh baby...

This bed is too lonely without you (Baby, baby)
Don't wanna hold my pillow, I wanna hold you (I wanna hold ya, hold ya)
Please be beside me, these king-size sheets
Need more than just a queen in between 'em (Yeah)
This bed is too lonely without you (Too lonely, yeah)
