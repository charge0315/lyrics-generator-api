If I could make a wish
I think I'd pass
Can't think of anything I need
No cigarettes, no sleep, no light, no sound
Nothing to eat, no books to read
Making love with you
Has left me peaceful on inside
What more could I ask
There's nothing left to be desired

Sometimes
All I need is the air that I breathe
And to love you
All I need is the air that I breathe
Yes to love you
All I need is the air that I breathe
Alright
You're all I want
You're all I want
You're all I want

Peace came upon me and it breathes in me
Don't sleep silent angel don't you sleep

Sometimes (Sometimes)
All I need is the air that I breathe
And to love you (just to have you now)
All I need is the air that I breathe
Yes to love you
All I need is the air that I breathe
Alright
You're all I want
You're all I want

Sometimes (Sometimes)
All I need is the air that I breathe
And to love you (just to have you now)
All I need is the air that I breathe
Yes to love you
All I need is the air that I breathe
You're all I want
You're all I want

Sometimes
All I need is the air that I breathe
And to love you
(Just to have you now)
