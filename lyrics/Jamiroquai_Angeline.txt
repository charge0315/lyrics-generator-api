Angeline yeah
It might just be another lady
Another lady that I break tonight
So what's the use in conversation
Can't stop until I'm wrapped up tight
I love to watch you when your sleeping
But there's a tiger and it likes to bite
CHORUS:
And I can't get out
I know your lies are a bad thing
But the bad things that you do
They got me, all wrapped up in you
Angeline
I'm not sure that I love you
But the bad things that you do
They got me, all mixed up in you
I'm shutting down
You've got a groovy latin voodoo magic back
I get worried about it
I said until it snows in California (Fornia)
I need to love you, red rose love's the way
And now I've got you on my radar (radar)
There's just a little thing that keeps me staying
REPEAT CHORUS
Angeline... Angeline... I've really got to know
Angeline... where'd you wanna bite me every night
Angeline... you got a roar like it's still me
Angeline... I keep on trying to cast you
Angeline... why'd you wanna bite me every night
Angeline... yeah... lady I'm all mixed up in you again
Angeline... yeah (I can't get out) all mixed up in you
Again... Angeline
Angeline... yeah (I can't get out) all mixed up in you
Again... Angeline
