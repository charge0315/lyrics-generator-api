Not a star showed out in the sky
That very night in pitch Black City
I was so damn scared
It was dark, it was so dim
It was a shame
Just then, a man walked up to me and said
"Didn't I see you here before?"
The lights were low and the party was so dull
Just not good enough
Holiday.  (Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.)
Celebrate.  (Holiday.  What you say?)
Holiday
Celebrate.  (Ahhhhh, yeah!)
Holiday
Celebrate.  (Alright.  Ow!)
Holiday
Celebrate.  (Whoo!)
Then we both held hands in each other's
For a chance to start it moving
He reached deep inside of his vest
And in his hand, he held a ring
Let's have a lunch, picnic or a brunch
In the wintertime
Let's disco down in a roller skating ring
In Alaska Town.  (Ohhhhhhhh!)
Holiday.  (Holiday.)
Celebrate.  (Come on, come on, celebrate.)
Holiday.  (Woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo.)
Celebrate
Holiday.  (Got the feeling.  Come on, keep ahead)
Celebrate.  (reeling.  Holiday, yeah, yeah.)
Holiday.  (Ahhhhh, ah!  Oh.)
Celebrate
(Instrumental break)
Not a star showed out in the sky
That very night in Pitch Black City
I was so damn scared
It was dark, it was so dim
It was a shame
Just then, a man walked up to me and said
"Didn't I see you here before?"
The lights were low and the party was so dull
Just not good enough
Holiday
Holiday
Holiday
Celebrate
Holiday
Holiday
Holiday
Celebrate
