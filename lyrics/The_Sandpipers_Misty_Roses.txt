You look to me like misty roses
Too soft to touch
But too lovely, to leave alone

If I could be like misty roses
I'd love you much
You're too lovely, to leave alone

Flowers often cry
But too late to find
That their beauty has been lost
With their peace of mind

If I believe in love forever
I'd forget the past
You're too lovely not to try

If I believe in love forever
I'd forget the past
You're too lovely not to try

You look to me like misty roses
You look to me like misty roses
You look to me like misty roses
