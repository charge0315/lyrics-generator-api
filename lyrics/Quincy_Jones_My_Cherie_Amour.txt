My cherie amour, lovely as a summer day
My cherie amour, distant as the Milky Way
My cherie amour, pretty little one that I adore
You're the only girl my heart lives for
How I wish that you were mine

Ooh, I see you, you
Oh, oh, I see you
My cherie amour, won't you tell me how you could ignore
That behind that smile I wore
How I wish that you were mine

La, la
La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la

Cherie, (My cherie amour), cherie
Cherie, my cherie amour, yeah, yеah
Cherie (You're thе one my heart beats for)
Cherie, cherie, my cherie amour, yeah, yeah
Love me, yes, I do, really do
You know I do, ooh baby
Love, love, wish that girl that you were mine
Wish that girl that you were mine

La, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la

Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
And maybe someday, I'll share your little distant cloud
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
My cherie amour, pretty little one that I adore
You're the only one my heart beats for
How I wish that you were mine

La, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la
