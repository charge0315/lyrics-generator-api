So they say that time
Takes away the pain
But I’m still the same
And they say that I
Will find another you
That can’t be true, oh

Oh, why didn’t I realise?
Why did I tell lies?
Yeah, I wish that I could do it again
Oh, turnin’ back the time
Back when you were mine
All mine

So this is heartache?
So this is heartache?
All this pain in the chest, my regrets
And things we never said, oh baby
So this is heartache?
So this is heartache?
What me meant, what we said that night
Why did I let you go?
I miss you

So they say that I didn’t know what I had in my life until it’s gone
The truth is that I knew you were the life
We never knew it would end

Oh, baby watching you walk away
Why didn’t I make you stay?
Yeah, I wish that I could do it again
Turnin’ back the time
Back when you were mine
All mine, yeah

So this is heartache?
So this is heartache?
All this pain in the chest, my regrets
And things we never said, oh baby
So this is heartache?
So this is heartache?
What me meant, what we said that night
Why did I let you go?
I miss you

It’s so hard to forget
Getting worse as the pain goes by
Yeah, it’s so hard to forget
What do I do in all of this life?
You and all the regret
I tried and hide the pain with nothing
I’ll never be alive with no more you and I
I can’t forget the look in your eyes

So this is heartache?
So this is heartache?
All this pain in the chest, my regrets
And things we never said, oh baby
So this is heartache?
So this is heartache?
What we meant, what we said that night
Why did I let you go?
I miss you

I miss you
I miss you
I miss you
