(Th. Tol/J. Tuijp/C. Tol)
Well did you hear about the story of the red balloon
Little Johnny, he was called to be the captain of the crew
He went aboard the ship and said: "We're gonna leave here soon"
Little Johnny's selling tickets to the moon
"So hurry if you want to come along with me today"
He says, and then the band begins to play
And this my friend is a wonderland
So hold my hand
They were singing with the band, band, band
For all we need's a breeze in the air
Rushing over mountains, watching the surroundings
The captain gives the orders and we all obey
And this my friend is a wonderland
So hold my hand
They were singing with the band, band, band
For all we need's a breeze in the air
Rushing over mountains, watching the surroundings
The captain gives the orders and we all obey
One day when Johnny tried to get it down, that red balloon
He found out he never learned that trick the others didn't too
And so they moved up higher and they realized it soon
They were really going to be there on the moon
The people down below they shouted and they were afraid
But still there was the band for them to play
(Up there, up there, they're going on, they're going on)
And this my friend is a wonderland
So hold my hand
They were singing with the band, band, band
For all we need's a breeze in the air
Rushing over mountains, watching the surroundings
The captain gives the orders and we all obey
And this my friend is a wonderland
So hold my hand
They were singing with the band, band, band
For all we need's a breeze in the air
Rushing over mountains, watching the surroundings
The captain gives the orders and we all obey
Well here my friends, my story ends
They story of the year
But we're living in a crazy world
So close your eyes and dream again
