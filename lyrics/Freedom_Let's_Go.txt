I had a daydream that I just killed a bredda
I love money but the streets is like my guilty pleasure
Walk up on him, I ain't talking like the Filthy Fellas
My phone rang and that's a hundred thousand filthy tenners
I had a daydream that I was rich forever
But it was way back in the day and we could all be bredrins
You kept it real and never ratted on your co-defendants
You never tried to block my blessings when this shit was destined
I had a nightmare, the judge gave me a life sentence
'Cause a man thought that he could rob me for my nice pendant
I'm gonna die trying, there's nuttin I ain't tried sellingCan't think of what I wanna buy, now I'm tryna buy them guy's melons
I had a nightmare, couple of my guys telling
Telling on some heavy shit just to get a light sentence
The mizzy fits thirty-two like it's a nice denim
Don't let a snake infiltrate, the hate spreads like venom

My daydreams and nightmares got the same people in
My head's a jungle, I don't know who let the demons in
I see him first so he never saw me reach
I let it stutter, you ever see "The King's Speech?"
I shot a pussy, took a shower with the bleach
These daydreams and nightmares won't let me sleep

How are my nightmares so close to my dreams?
How was I distant from my family but so close to the fiends?
Yeah, I was in that visit hall embarrassed, she ghosted my V
Now she look like she see a ghost, I'm in that new Ghost with Cee
I love my life so I won't think twice 'bout blowing this heat
But these nightmares got me thinking twice 'bout going to sleep
'Cause another lost his life when they swerved on the scene
Now he'll never wake up, these guns give permanent dreams
Yeah, I used to daydream about a million quid
And then I woke up rich but I was still on some shit
Down the block, on the netting, gotta send in the nationals
My hood pass is guaranteed like a crash course
I was with the killers that'll slap more
I was running water by the tap more
I was tryna rap but I was selling crack more, I'm stuck in my daydream
I need to calm down, I'm tryna fuck up the mainstream

My daydreams and nightmares got the same people in
My head's a jungle, I don't know who let the demons in
I see him first so he never saw me reach
I let it stutter, you ever see "The King's Speech?"
I shot a pussy, took a shower with the bleach
These daydreams and nightmares won't let me sleep

Just got a fours in again
And it's crazy 'cause the same thing that's keeping me safe
Is the same thing causing me painAnd it's crazy 'cause them same guys that talk on my name
See me in real life and them guys ain't talking the same
Got all these thoughts on my brain
Shit, you oughta be ashamed
I'll just say his name and make it awkward again
Remember it was bait and I still bored him again
Nah, I'm just daydreaming 'cause I'm bored of the fame

My daydreams and nightmares got the same people in
My head's a jungle, I don't know who let the demons in
I see him first so he never saw me reach
I let it stutter, you ever see "The King's Speech?"
I shot a pussy, took a shower with the bleach
These daydreams and nightmares won't let me sleep
