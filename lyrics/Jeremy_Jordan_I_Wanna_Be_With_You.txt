Oh yeah... baby.. yeah.. yeah..baby.. I want....
When she walked right by, I cannot deny her attraction, was more than I could stand.. should I stop and stare.. I cannot ignore, should I speak or just let it go...
I don't even know her name, but she had me when she looked in my eyes.. should I lay it on the line or would it be a waste of time...
CHORUS: I wanna be with you (hey) I wanna make you mine (mine) I wanna give all my time (I wanna give you all of my time) If you will let me know (let me know) If this the kind of sign , That this attraction is newly found.. Come on baby don't you know you got me sayin'
Hey... I want your lovin..
She didn't realized, or wishin made me feel inside, I wonder if you feeling it too... gotta take my time, don't wanna put a rush in her.. 'Cause if I do, it maybe too soon.. oh yeah..
I've gotta get to know that girl, if it's the last thing that I'd do.. I wonder if there's someone special, 'Cause if not, may be I could be the one...
Hey.... hey... hey..... baby
Girl you didn't realized..when you looked in to my eyes....etc
