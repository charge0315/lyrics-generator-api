Don't wait another night
Don't save your love until tomorrow
Don't wait another night
Don't hit me back with a horrow
Been thinking about the lovin'
we had, oh last night
Makin' love as warm
you held me so tight
It felt just like a dream, so sweet
don't you think so
The morning came so soon
I thought we've lasted so long
Don't wait another night (Oh, no)
Don't save your love until tomorrow
Don't wait another night (Oh I need you baby)
Don't hit me back with a horrow
Don't wait another night (You heard me baby)
Don't save your love until tomorrow
Don't wait another night (Why you wanna make me wait)
Don't hit me back with a horrow
Remember all the time we spent so close together
Your touch was also warm, I wanted it forever
This light that burns inside, so bright, you know can't hide
I always want you near, to feel your love inside me
Don't wait another night (Give it to me baby)
Don't save your love until tomorrow
Don't wait another night (Don't make me wait)
Don't hit me back with a horrow
Don't wait another night (I need it now)
Don't save your love until tomorrow
Don't wait another night (I want your love)
Don't hit me back with a horrow
Been thinking about the lovin'
we had, oh last night
Makin' love as warm
you held me so tight
It felt just like a dream, so sweet
don't you think so
The morning came so soon
I thought we've lasted so long
Don't wait another night (I want you now)
Don't save your love until tomorrow
Don't wait another night (Oh baby)
Don't hit me back with a horrow (Why you wanna make me wait)
Don't wait another night (Good lovin)
Don't save your love until tomorrow (Oh that's what it's all about)
Don't wait another night
Don't hit me back with a horrow
Don't wait another night (Oh no)
Don't save your love until tomorrow (Don't save it, don't save it, why you wanna make me wait)
Don't wait another night (I need it now)
Don't hit me back with a horrow (Don't save it, don't save it)
Good good lovin'
Give it to me baby
