If there's one rule to this game
Everybody's gonna name
It's be cool
If you're worried or uncertain
If your feelings are hurtin'
You're a fool if you can't keep cool
Charm 'em
Don't alarm 'em
Keep things light
Keep your worries out of sight
And play it cool
Play it cool
Fifty-fifty
Fire and ice
If your heart is on the floor
Cause you've just seen your lover
Comin' through the door with a new fool
Be cool
Don't you sweat it
Stop right here right now tryin' to forget it
Your nobody's fool
Don't get riled
Smile-keep it light
Be your own best friend tonight
And play it cool
Play it cool
Fifty-fifty
Fire and ice
Don't get jealous
Don't get over-zealous
Be cool
Don't whine
Kiss off that flaky valentine
You're nobody's fool
So if there's one rule to this game
Everybody's gonna name
It's be cool
If you're worried or uncertain
If your feelings are hurtin'
You're a fool if you can't keep cool
Charm 'em
Don't alarm 'em
Keep things light
Keep your worries out of sight
And play it cool
Play it cool
Fifty-fifty
Fire and ice
Play it cool
Fifty-fifty
Fire and ice
Play it cool, play it cool boy
Fifty-fifty
Fire and ice
