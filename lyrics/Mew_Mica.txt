I wanted to remember my Mica
You helped me again to think of the
Unthinkable things
Made my arms hurt so bad I would
Happily forget
Communicate with no less doubt
Still while I was proud
Speak to me with electric mouth
(You and it all)
You're surprised at what you go through
As if no one ever told you
On your own feet
Your own feet stand
I've done more than I would like to
But it's not all that I can do
You gotta get outta bed
When even your bad luck runs out
Not to wallow in
Self-pityingly pathetic dreams
You know what I mean
Enchanted by a dark design
You would never think
And as the words would start flowing
I'd just come apart
She worked hard to be his novice
And then broke into his office
With her clothes off
Her clothes off still
You should settle for a small dart
If you can't find it in your heart
But there's a big noise from her chest
Let me do the talking
Now that I'm here
You'll steal all the attention anyway
Cause something about you compels me to feel
That a glued together vase is still a vase
I wanted to remember my Mica
