Oh baby, since you went away

Scorpio so true never thought that you would hurt me, hurt me
With your witches brew, build me up then you desert me, hurt me
Fascinated me till all I could see was nothing but you
Each night I see you in my dreams, you keep haunting me

Cause you were born on Halloween a queen of witchcraft, witchcraft
You were born on Halloween a queen of witchcraft, witchcraft

October thirty first must have put a curse upon me (On me)
Fell in love with you then away you flew without me (Left me)
Had a bag of tricks, put me in a fix, you tricked me it's true
I'm so alone since you've been gone
You keep haunting me

Cause you were born on Halloween
A queen of witchcraft, witchcraft
You were born on Halloween a queen of witchcraft, witchcraft
Oh, oh baby since you went away
Each night I see you in my dreams, you keep haunting me

Cause you were born on Halloween a queen of witchcraft, witchcraft
Said that you were born on Halloween a queen of witchcraft, witchcraft
Born on Halloween a queen of witchcraft, witchcraft

Born on a special day
And I know what it means since you took your love away
