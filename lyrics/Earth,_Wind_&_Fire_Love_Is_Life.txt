Have you ever seen a flower
Tryin' to bloom in a dry barren land?
But then comes a sweet spring shower
Just to lend a helpin' hand
Like the love of you and I
All at once it came alive
You brought love
And your love is life
Did you ever watch a mother
And how tender she treats a child?
And the birds in the treetops
How they protect their young from the wild
And, girl, your love
It comforts me
And that's my security
You brought love
And your love is life
You brought me love
And your love is life
Now, this is a song of love
Let's everyone sing along for love this evening
Come on and sing along with us now
Give love from your heart this evening
Don't wait, don't wait 'til tomorrow
