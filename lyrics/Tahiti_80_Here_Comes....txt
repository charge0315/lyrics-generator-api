Here comes another day
The bird of gray has finally flown away
I guess I'm doing fine
Though it took me quite a while
Had a hole in my head
Where my thoughts went dead
Had a hole in my heart
But I need it to mend
Couldn't figure out a note to play
I got it all mixed up along the way
That was another day
I'm sorry for the things I've done
I had so many ups and down
That was, that was, that was yesterday
Here comes, here comes another day
Now that my weary days are gone
I feel like telling everyone
Forget about yesterday
Here comes, here comes another day
Now I'm ready to get back in the game
I'm making sure the rules are not the same
Do you still want me in your life?
I can't be a man without a wife
Tell me, what do you say?
Here comes another day
I'm sorry for the things I've done
I had so many ups and down
That was, that was, that was yesterday
Here comes, here comes another day
Now that my weary days are gone
I feel like telling everyone
Forget about yesterday
Here comes, here comes another day
I'm sorry for the things I've done
That was, that was, that was yesterday
I feel like telling everyone
Here comes, here comes another day
