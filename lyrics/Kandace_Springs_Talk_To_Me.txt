Talk to me
Talk to me
I've been trying to look inside your heart
Talk to me
Talk to me
But silence keeps on pushing us apart

I wanna know what you really see
Before it's too late
And you're far away from me
Talk to me

Talk to me
Talk to me
The voices like a song I  here
Talk to me
Talk to me
All these days will pass on into

Remember that you're free, yeah
And all I want is for you to talk to me
Talk to me

Talk to me, oh
Talk to me, yeah, yeah
Talk to me, yeah

Oh-oh, la la la
La la la la
Oh-oh-hey, la la la
La la la la, yeah

Remember that you're free, yeah
And all I want is for you to talk to me
Talk to me

Talk to me
Talk to me, oh
Talk to me, yeah, oh-oh
Talk to me
Talk to me
Talk to me, yeah, yeah
Talk to me, yeah, oh
Talk to me

Ooh-woah, hey, oh-oh
