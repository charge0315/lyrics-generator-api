You had a good time
You smiled your happy smile
THe emptiness inside's gone now
Like the sparkle in your eyes
You feel happy and confused
Empty and amused
As if nothing could hurt you
Nothing could hurt you
It's about time, it's about time
You smiled your happy smile
You say you know, but, no, you don't know
The emptiness inside
It's about time, it's about time
Happy and confused
Empty and amused
Nothing can hurt you
Nothing could hurt you
No need to be sorry
No need to feel guilty
This is just a feeling
Nothing but a feeling
It's about time
You smiled your happy smile
You say you know, but, no, you don't know
Happy and amused
Empty and confused
As if nothing can hurt you
Nothing can hurt you
No need to be sorry
No need to feel guilty
This is just a feeling
Nothing but a feeling
You say you know, but, no, you don't know
You had a good time
You smiled your happy smile
The emptiness inside's gone now
Like the sparkle in your eyes
