Yeah, huh

Fuck, I think I got up at four in the night
Diamonds all in my body, I swear I'm sworn to ice, yeah
I'ma time travel in a DeLorean tonight, yeah
Your bitch all on my dick, I got the force tonight
'Cause I pulled up to the crib, I make a porn tonight, yeah
Brought a two and oasis
I'll be speed racing
We switch places, yeah

I fuck her good and that's true love
Yeah, singing melodies to that bitch like I'm Bone-Thug
She came to the crib, bought me a new rug
I fuck that bitch, let her sweat out her tracks and get in my new tub
It's big B's and P's, shoutout Buddha
Yeah, and Chris King, nigga, we eating, bitch, we some true thugs
Snotty nose, threw my tissue up
Hachoo, but fuck you, bitch, I'm already blessed up

Fuck, I think I got up at four in the night
Diamonds all in my body, I swear I'm sworn to ice, yeah
I'ma time travel in a DeLorean tonight, yeah
Your bitch all on my dick, I got the force tonight
'Cause I pulled up to the crib, I make a porn tonight, yeah
Brought a two and oasis
I'll be speed racing (Snotty Nose Mafia, bitch)
We switch places, yeah

It took us so long to get here, but, yeah, we had the patience (Yeah)
Life's a cartoon, I question your character, rappers are animated
We fresh to death with dead presidents as if we had to grave dig
Too many whips inside the garage, like our ancestors on slave ships, now play this, wait
I pull up in your motherfucking driveway
Kick down the door like it's my place
Say that pussy's mine, babe
Beat that pussy sideways
1400 on me, that's my gang
Snotty Nose, that's my gang
Don't get hit with that slime, way
Gotta go, forgot what the time says (Brrat)

Fuck, I think I got up at four in the night
Diamonds all in my body, I swear I'm sworn to ice, yeah
I'ma time travel in a DeLorean tonight, yeah
Your bitch all on my dick, I got the force tonight
'Cause I pulled up to the crib, I make a porn tonight, yeah
Brought a two and oasis
I'll be speed racing
We switch places, yeah
