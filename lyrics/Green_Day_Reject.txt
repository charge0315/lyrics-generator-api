Who the hell are you to tell me
What I am and what's my master plan?
What makes you think that it includes you?
Self-righteous wealth, stop flattering yourself

So when the smoke clears, here I am
Your reject all-American
Suckin' up to your social sect
Makin' you a nervous wreck
To hell and back and hell again, I've gone

You're not my type
You're not my type

What's the difference between you and me?
I do what I want, and you do what you're told
So listen and shut the hell up
It's no big deal, and I'll see you in hell

So when the smoke clears, here I am
Your reject all-American
Suckin' up to your social sect
Makin' you a nervous wreck
To hell and back and hell again, I've gone

You're not my type
You're not my type
You're not my type
You're not my type

So when the smoke clears, here I am
Your reject all-American
Fallin' from grace, right on my face
To hell and back and hell again, I've gone
Say again, what?
