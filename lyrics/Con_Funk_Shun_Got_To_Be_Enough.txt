The things I do for you
I do for no one else
The things I give to you
Usually keep them for myself
Every chance I take with you
'Cause my luck is on the one
Your tricks, your treat, they can't be beat
They keep me on the run
I've got to be enough, girl
(Think about it, don't you doubt it)
I wanna be your stuff, girl
(Think about it, don't you doubt it)
I've got to be enough, girl
(Think about it, don't you doubt it)
Until you get enough, girl, why don't you
(Think about it, don't you doubt it)
Places that you wanna go
I'll take you anytime
Cash to buy you pretty things
I'm working overtime
You take all the lovin', baby
That my body has to give
Run with my affections, girl
As long as you may live
I've got to be enough, girl
(Think about it, don't you doubt it)
I wanna be your stuff, girl
(Think about it, don't you doubt it)
I've got to be enough, girl
(Think about it, don't you doubt it)
Hey, hey
Until you get enough, girl, why don't you
(Think about it, don't you doubt it)
Get funky with me, child
Don't you see, oh, you're sweet to me, sweet baby
Get funky with me, child
Don't you see, oh, you're sweet to me, pretty baby
Get funky with me, child
Don't you see, oh, you're sweet to me
Get funky with me, child
Don't you see, oh, you're sweet to me
Get funky with me, child
Don't you see, oh, you're sweet to me, yeah hey
Get funky with me, child
Don't you see, oh, you're sweet to me
I've got to be enough, girl
(Think about it, don't you doubt it)
I wanna be your stuff, girl
(Think about it, don't you doubt it)
I've got to be enough, girl
(Think about it, don't you doubt it)
Come on
Until you get enough, girl, why don't you
(Think about it, don't you doubt it)
