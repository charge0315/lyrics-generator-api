Well, we’ve been together since we met
As soul to soul as two can get
Well, day by day, our hearts entwine
'Til I can’t tell yours from mine
If you should ever want to go
And make this our last episode
I’ll exit with a graceful bow
But I’ll always be around
My Promise to you is I’ll be there (I’ll be there)
With a love that’s tried and true
And I promise to always care
When you need me, I’ll soon be there
I’ll be there
I won’t attempt to half conceal
This boundless joy you make me feel
From way back when to here and now
If you need me, I’ll be around
My Promise to you: have no fear
When you need, I’m here for you
And I promise to always care
When you call me, I’ll be there
My Promise to you, have no fear
When you need, I’m here for you
And I promise to always care
When you call me, I’ll be there
I’m holding on to this love we share, and...
Anytime you want, I’ll be right there
Giving you my love
My Promise to you, have no fear
When you need, I’m here for you
And I promise to always care
When you call me, I’ll be there
