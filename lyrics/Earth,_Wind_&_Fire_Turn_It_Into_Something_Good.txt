Why do you hang your head
And never, never satisfy the loneliness you tread
Spending your life in the falling rain
Forget about the memories that's driving you insane

You can't hide forever, just decide to make it better
Turn it into something good
Remember, you can choose not to lose
Find your groove and be a winner

Wake up, take a step ahead
Wake up to the rising sun
Wake up, life has just begun to shine
Wake up, take a step ahead
Wake up to the rising sun
Wake up, life has just begun to shine

In your eyes the somber blues
Reflect a place from deep inside of knowing not what to do
I'll be your rock, when you're 'bout to fall
Together, we'll move on ahead and walk right through it all

You can't hide forever, just decide to make it better
Turn it into something good
Remember, you can choose not to lose
Find your groove and be a winner
Turn it into something good
Remember, you can't hide forever, just decide to make it better
You can't hide forever, yeah
Wake up

In your eyes, I see truth
Baby, oh baby, me and you
Just believe in what I say
Life will lead us, oh, baby, what to do

Wake up, take a step ahead
Wake up to the rising sun
Wake up, life has just begun to shine
Wake up, take a step ahead
Wake up to the rising sun
Wake up, life has just begun to shine
