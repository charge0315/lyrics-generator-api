Saw her out last night on the town
A makeshift alibi under her sleeve
I can't take this anymore
Don't know what I love her for
I'm gonna lock away my heart this time
But if you see her
Tell her you're a friend of mine
Oh, promise me you will
Tell her to send a little love my way
Send a little love my way
'Cause I know she'll come back to me
And it will be like always
Like always
Treat me like the kid with the clues
Why she is as cold as she can be
When you never tell a lie
Even when it makes her cry
That's the choice I made
So now you see
That I
Can't wait
So if you are a friend of mine
Tell her I'm to blame
Tell her
Tell her
To send a little love my way
Send a little love my way
'Cause I know she'll come back to me
And it will be
Like always
Like always
Tell her I'm to blame
Oh, promise me you will
Send a little love my way
Send a little love my way
Send a little luck my way
