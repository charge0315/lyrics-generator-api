Once in a while, out of the blue
I might appear somewhat rude
But don't be alarmed or get upset
Just say to yourself this I'll forget
And when I come home after being away
It might do me good just to hear you say
Darlin' don't move an inch, keep perfectly still
Now do with me what you will
Sometime ago before we met
I vowed to myself that I'd never let
No-one at all ever tie me down
Never dreaming that I'd see you around
Now isn't it strange wherever you go
It's always the same with whoever you know
Which just goes to prove what I've been trying to say
Looking at you the way I do (that's love)
Promising always to be true (that's love)
Giving each other a helping hand (that's love)
Sharing each other's every plan, that's love
And in love you do
And isn't it strange wherever you go
It's always the same with whoever you know
Which just goes to prove what I've been dying to say
Holding you now the way I do (that's love)
Knowing full well you want me to (that's love)
Telling each other how we feel (that's love)
Knowing inside it must be real, that's love
And in love it's true
