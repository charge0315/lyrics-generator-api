On a wonderful day like today
I defy any cloud to appear in the sky
Dare any rain drop to plop in my eye
On a wonderful day like today
On a wonderful morning like this
When the sun is as big as a yellow balloon
Even the sparrows are singing in tune
On a wonderful morning like this
On a morning like this I could kiss everybody
I’m so full of love and goodwill
Let me say furthermore
I’d adore everybody to come and dine
The pleasure’s mine and I will pay the bill
May I take this occasion to say
That the whole human racе should go down on its knees
Show that we’re grateful for mornings likе these
For the world’s in a wonderful way
On a wonderful day like today
On a morning like this I could kiss everybody
I’m so full of love and goodwill
Let me say furthermore
I’d adore everybody to come and dine
The pleasure’s mine and I will pay the bill
May I take this occasion to say
That the whole human race should go down on its knees
Show that we’re grateful for mornings like these
For the world’s in a wonderful way
On a wonderful day like today
