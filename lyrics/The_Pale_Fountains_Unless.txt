There was a lonely boy or should I say
He was seventeen ? You went away
There was a long lost song or should I say
It was almost May, I loved a long long way
Where has he gone from here ?
What should I do or try to say ?
There is a way unless
Where has love gone from here ?
How can I try and find a way, way ?
There was an autumn night or should I say
I was in a dream ? It went away
There was a preacher man, let's have fun and
The boat had to sail, it went away
Where has he gone from here ?
What should I do or try to say ?
There is a way unless
Where has love gone from here ?
How can I try and find a way, way ?
Learning to love was like a game
A game I could not win
Pretend you ...................
Where do we go from here ?
What should I do or try to say ?
There is a way unless
Where has love gone from here ?
How can I try and find a way ?
There is a way unless
Where has love gone from here ?
What should I do or try to say, say ?
There is a way unless
Where do we go from here ?
What should I do or try to say ?
