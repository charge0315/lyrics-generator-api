Move a little slower
I think I'm almost there
Inch by inch, we’re closer
Paradise is near

I can feel your warm inside
Waiting for that moment we're all in joy

Oh, why
I wanna make it last forever
Come on, baby
Make it last forever
Oh, make it last forever
Come on darling
Make it last forever

Not a single minute
Of pleasure that you bring

I can you feel you warm inside
It’s a feeling we just can't hide
