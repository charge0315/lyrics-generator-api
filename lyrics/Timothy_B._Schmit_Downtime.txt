Schmit
I can't jump 'cause I'm feeling heavy
I can't take this gravity
I can't dance 'cause there ain't no music
And these shoes are killing me
I can't float if there ain't no water
I can't breathe if there ain't no air
I can't leave 'cause there ain't no window
And it's way too cold out there
I don't like to find myself staring into space
I think I better stay up all night
Or I might disappear without a single trace
I don't stop 'cause I keep on rolling
Though I can't always see
I can't hide 'cause the truth is showing
And it's got the best of me
Every now and then I gotta shut down
So I sit on my front porch
Take it easy for a minute and slow my mind
Then I get up, I jump into my car
And head down to the ocean
It doesn't matter if it's rain or shine
I just need a little downtime
I can't wait if I have no patience
I can't hear if there ain't no sound
I can't think 'cause my head's too crowded
I think I better get out of town
I feel the beat of my heart going way too fast
If I don't put my foot down soon
I don't know how I'm gonna make things last
I don't break when my heart is aching
I can't sing if there ain't no song
I gotta rethink my situation
I do believe that something's wrong
Every now and then I gotta shut down
So I sit on my front porch
Take it easy for a minute and slow my mind
Then I get up, I jump into my car
And head down to the ocean
It doesn't matter if it's rain or shine
I just need a little downtime
I don't like to find myself staring into space, no
I think I better stay up all night
Or I might disappear without a single trace
I can't climb if there ain't no ladder
I can't deal if there ain't no cards
I won't sigh 'cause it makes me sadder
I've had enough and it's way too hard
Every now and then I gotta shut down
So I sit on my front porch
Take it easy for a minute and slow my mind, yeah
Then I get up, I jump into my car
And head down to the ocean
It doesn't matter if it's rain or shine
Step in the water and I feel just fine
Don't need to smoke, I don't need no wine
I only need a little downtime
Downtime
Downtime
