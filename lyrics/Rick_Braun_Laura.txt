Was there light on the water when I fell in and drowned?
Did anyone see my body go down?
Did he call out "Someone help, she can't swim!"?
Or did he just laugh when I slipped and fell in?
I went down without a trace
And all I could see was a smile on his face
I fell in
Was I pushed?
Did I fall?
But when I went down
I went down like a rock
Did anyone jump in or climb down the rungs?
To catch me and save me and pump out my lungs?
I saw nobody cry on board
Nobody offered a prayer
Did anyone notice?
Doesn't anyone care?
I went down without a trace
And all I could see was a smile on his face
I fell in
Was I pushed?
Did I fall?
But when I went down
I went down like a rock
Was there light on the water when I fell in and drowned?
Did anyone see my body go down?
Did he call out "Someone help, she can't swim!"?
Or did he just laugh when I slipped and fell in?
I went down without a trace
And all I could see was a smile on his face
I fell in
Was I pushed?
Did I fall?
But when I went down
I went down like a rock
I went down without a trace
And all I could see was a smile on his face
I fell in
Was I pushed?
Did I fall?
But when I went down
I went down like a rock
