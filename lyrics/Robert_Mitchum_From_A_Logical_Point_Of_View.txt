If you want to be happy living a king's life
Never make a pretty woman your wife
If you want to be happy living a king's life
Never make a pretty woman your wife
Now all you have to do is just what I say
And then you may be jolly, merry and gay
Therefore, from a logical point of view
Better marry a woman uglier than you
From a logical point of view
Always marry a woman uglier than you
A pretty woman make a husband look small
And very often causes his downfall
Soon as she marries then and there she starts
To do the things that will break your heart
And when you think that she is belonging to you
She is calling somebody else to do
Man, from a logical point of view
Better marry a woman uglier than you
From a logical point of view
Always marry a woman uglier than you
But if you make an ugly woman your wife
You can be sure you will be happy in all your life
She will never do things in a funny way
To allow the neighbor have things to say
She wouldn't disregard the husband at all
By exhibiting herself too bitter and cold
Man, from a logical point of view
Better marry a woman uglier than you
From a logical point of view
Always marry a woman uglier than you
An ugly woman give your meals on time
And try to make you comfortable in mind
At times when you lie sick in your cozy bed
She will both caress you and scratch your head
And not a minute in the night will she leave you alone
It seems you want to melt the cold from your bone
Man, from a logical point of view
Better marry a woman uglier than you
From a logical point of view
Always marry a woman uglier than you
If a man that's not your friend say that you have no taste
Marry an ugly woman above disgrace
One who is cute, looking barbarous and rough
The skin like alligator, bumpy and tough
Pigeon-hole, bull-leg, across in her eye
She got two lips that look like a big bow tie
Boy, from a logical point of view
Better marry a woman uglier than you
From a logical point of view
Always marry a woman uglier than you
From a logical point of view
Always marry a woman uglier than you
