Somewhere in time there's a light that will someday
Be a sign, for all mankind
Behind the veil of our minds
If we open up our eyes
We will find you and I
She's waitin' for, waitin' for, waitin' for
She's waitin' for, waitin' for, waitin' for me
She's waitin' for, waitin' for, waitin' for
She's waitin' for, waitin' for, waitin' for me
Don't waste your time with one of her kind
Were the words so sublime not being said
But to resign what the heart and mind
Would no longer deny was a cause for dread
Come the day you awake to discover
That this day did not come for some other
Lies and hate
One day you'll find
Love, she waits
Don't you dismay
Someday you'll find
Love, she waits
There comes a time at least once in a life
One has to decide what is right for them, yeah
Sure as sunlight brings an end to night
It can only be right to begin again
Come the day you awake to discover
That this day did not come for some other
Life and faith
Someday you'll find
Love, she waits
Why not make haste
Far beyond the clouds
Love, she waits
