I heard about your dad
How they shot him in the head
I know you made it through
But you're not the same
I felt so sick when I watched
The news report on TV
I couldn't help thinking
What if that was me?
And I knew it would stay for a while
But the picture is here all the time
And I thought it would stay for a while
But it's stuck in my mind all the time
You never see what's coming
Look where you belong now
You wake
You didn't see it coming
Look where you belong now
You wake up one morning
And all you ever had is gone
You never see what's coming
Look what you've become now
You wake up one morning
And all you ever had is gone
Gone
Gone
Gone
Why don't you stop diggin' your own hole?
Let's get out for the day
Walk past the old house where the dark mark's
Teasing him on the way
And if he gets out of there
He'll be running for a while
And if he comes after us
We'll find a place to hide
