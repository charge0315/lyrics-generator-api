As you discover changing times
You must have the strength to endure
Changing times, changing times, oh, oh
Changing times, changing
As you discover changing world
You can't be guessing, you must be for sure
Changing times, changing times, oh, oh
Changing times
In these ever changing times
You must learn to stand on your own
As we learn to, as we learn to grow
As we learn to, as we learn to grow
Life has so much to show you
You must be ready for the new
Space on the strife, fix up your life
Space on the strife, fix up your life
As you discover changing times
It's not so bad as you will find
Changing times, changing times, oh, oh
Changing times
As you discover changing world
A new direction you must keep in mind
Changing times, changing times, oh, oh
Changing times, changing
Life has so much to show you
You must be ready for the new
Space on the strife, fix up your life
Space on the strife, fix up your life
We go through so many changes
As we learn to, as we learn to grow
As we learn to grow
As we learn to, as we learn to grow
As we learn to, as we learn to grow
As we learn to, as we learn to grow
