[Verse 1: Billie Joe Armstrong &
Mike Dirnt

(
Oh
) A small cloud has fallen, the white mist hits the ground
My lungs comfort me with joy
(Oh) Vegging on one detail, the rest just crowds around
My eyes itch of burning red

Picture sounds
Of moving insects, so surreal
Lay around
Looks like I found something new

(Oh) Laying in my bed, I think I'm in left field
I picture someone, I think it's you
(Oh) You're standing so damn close, my body begins to swell
Why does 1 and 1 make 2?

Picture sounds
Of moving insects, so surreal
Lay around
Looks like I found something new

(Oh) Laying in my bed, I think I'm in left field
I picture someone, I think it's you
(
Oh
) You're standing so damn close, my body begins to swell
Why does 1 and 1 make 2?

Picture sounds
Of moving insects, so surreal
Lay around
Looks like I found something new
