People figure it out, you're just a reflection
Of all you're allowed to be
People moving around a single illusion
To keep you from falling down
Don't just do what you're told
Go and try it out or...
People unable to rise, take it or leave it
There's little to jeapordise
People what does it matter? You sit doing nothing
Just getting as fat as you can
Don't just do what you're told
Go and try it out or...
Ahhhhhh.......
People living through doubt, it's hardly an option
To hope it just all works out
Don't just do what you're told
Go and try it out or...
Ahhhhhh.......
