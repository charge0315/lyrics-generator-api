Ouh uuuh
Come on

I don't hardly know her
But I think I could love her
I hope she walks over
Because I've been waiting to show her
Crimson and clover
Over and over

Baby, I think I love you
I wanna know for sure
Come here and sock it to me one time
You move me
(Here we go, ooh)

Inside your sweet thing
Makes me want to sing
What a beautiful feeling
Crimson and clover
Over and over
Ooh

Baby I, I think I love you
But I want to know for sure
Oh come here, sock it to me one time
Ah, you move me, look out
