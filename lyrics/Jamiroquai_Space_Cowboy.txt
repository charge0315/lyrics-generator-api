Everything is good and brown
I'm here again
With a sunshine smile upon my face
My friends are close at hand
And all my inhibitions have disappeared without a trace
I'm glad, oh, that I found ooh
Somebody who I can rely on

This is the return of the space cowboy
Interplanetary, good vibe zone
Say, at the speed of cheeba, you and I go deeper
Maybe I'm gonna have to get high just to get by
You know I got that
I got that cheeba, cheeba kinda space cowboy vibe
Ah-ha ah yeah-ah

Everything is good, oh, and green
Say, I'm red again
And I don't suppose I'm coming down
I can see clearly, so high in sky
A man with psychedelic picture frames
Of happiness to shade his eyes
He's glad, oh, that I found
Somebody who he can rely on

This is the return of the space cowboy
Interplanetary, good vibe zone
Say, at the speed of cheeba, and we’ll go deeper
You and I, you and I, you and I, hey, oh
Now, this is the return of the space cowboy
He's got that, he's got that interplanetary good
Good vibe zone

Oh, good times, high times, good vibes, hey
Oh, I like what you're doing out here! yeah

Now, this is the return of the space cowboy
Interplanetary, interplanetary, good vibe zone
At the speed of cheeba, oh you and I

Maybe I'm gonna have to get high this time

This is the return of the space cowboy
Interplanetary, good vibe zone
