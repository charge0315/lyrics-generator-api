Everybody said, "now stay and wait
"Til you find out what is real."
So i flew halfway 'cross the states
Just to tell you what I really feel
And now I'm sinking in an ocean of tears
And I'm thinking of how it felt with you near
And wondering how I'll get out of this
When all I wanted was one more kiss
Keep your distance
There's no romance here
She said "a friend you will always be
Aw, your mind is hazy
Mine is clear, "
But my love can't stay hidden
It is free
And now I'm sinking in an ocean of tears
And I'm thinking of how it felt with you near
And wondering how I'll get out of this
When all I wanted was one more kiss
Oooh and now I'm sinking in an ocean of tears
And I'm thinking of how it felt with you near
And wondering how I'll get out of this
When all I wanted was one more
Kiss
When all I wanted was one more kiss
When all I wanted was one more kiss
Kiss
Yes
Yes
Yeah
Yes
Yeah
Yeah
Andy (yes, yeah)
