You don't have to be ashamed
'Cause you're a miracle through and through
You don't have to be ashamed
Of the miracle inside of you
What has love become?
(What has love become?)
It's not like we used to hear in those old songs
And it's not like yours
(And it's not like yours)
What has love become?
Whoa, oh, oh
Your love is in motion
And it's spinning me around again
Whoa, oh, oh
My heart is in motion
For the moment that's in you
You should not be angry
If all she wants is your money
Oh, you should not be angry
'Cause all you want is her body
What has love become?
(What has love become?)
It's not like we used to hear in those old songs
And it's not like yours
(And it's not like yours)
What has love become?
Whoa, oh, oh
Your love is a fast song
And I'm dancing 'cause I'm loved again
Whoa, oh, oh
My heart is in motion
For the rhythm inside you
Whoa, oh, oh
Your love is a slow song
It's resounding through my world again
Whoa, oh, oh
My heart is in motion
For the song inside of you

Whoa, oh, oh
Your love is in motion
And it's spinning me around again
Whoa, oh, oh
Your love is a fast song
And I'm dancing 'cause I'm loved again
Whoa, oh, oh
Your love is a slow song
It's resounding through my world again
Whoa, oh, oh
My heart is in motion
For the song inside of you
