So you wanted
To take a break
Slow it down some

I want my money back
And don't forget

To give me back my black T-shirt

So you wanted
To take a break
Slow it down some
And have some space

Give me my money back
Give me my money back
You bitch
I want my money back
I want my money back
And don't forget
