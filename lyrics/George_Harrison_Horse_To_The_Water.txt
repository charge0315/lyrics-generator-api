You can take a horse to the water but
You can't make it drink
Oh no, oh no, oh no

A friend of mine in so much misery
Some people sail through life, but he has struck a reef
I said, "Hey man, let's go out and get some wisdom"
First he turned on me, then turned off his nervous system

And you take a horse to the water but
You can't make it drink
Oh no, oh no, oh no
You can have it all laid out in front of you but
It don't make you think
Oh no, oh no, oh no

Someone I love has got a problem
Some people thirst for truth, but he would like a drink
I said, "Hey man, this could turn out to be risky"
He said, "Everything's okay" as he downed another bottle of whiskey

Yeah, you take a horse to the water but
You can't make it drink
Oh no, oh no, oh no
You can have it all staked out in front of you but
It still don't make you think
Oh no, oh no, oh no

Preacher out there warned me about Satan
Could be that he knows him, he acts like he is possessed
I said, "Hey man, let's hear about God realisation for a change"
He said, "We don't got time for that, first you must hear the evils of fornication"

Yeah, you take a horse to the water but
You can't make it drink
Oh no, oh no, oh no
You can have it all staked out in front of you but
It still don't make you think
Oh no, oh no, oh no

Horse to the water, can't make it drink
Ooh-ooh-ooh
All staked out in front of you, don't make you think
Ooh-ooh-ooh
