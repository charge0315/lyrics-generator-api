Do me wrong, do me right, do me right, baby
Tell me lies, but hold, hold me tight
Save your goodbyes till the morning light
But don't let me be lonely tonight

Say goodbye, woman, say hello, say hello
It's sure enough good to see you, oh but it's time to go
And don't say yes, but please don't say no
I don't want to be lonely tonight

Go away then, damn you
Go on and do as you please, do as you please
But you aren't going to see me getting down on my knees
'Cause I'm undecided and your heart's been divided
You've been turning my world upside down

Do me wrong, do me right, do me right, baby
Don't run and tell me lies, but hold, hold me tight
And save your goodbyes till the morning light
But don't let me be lonely tonight

Save your goodbyes till the morning light
But don't let me be lonely tonight
Because I don't want to be lonely tonight
I don't want to be lonely
Don't do it, don't do it, don't do it, don't do it
