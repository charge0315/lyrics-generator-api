(Two, a-three, a-four)

Paint no illusion, try to click with what you got
Taste every potion 'cause if you like yourself a lot
Go let it out, go let it in, and go let it out
(Pick up the bass)

Life is precocious in the most peculiar way
Sister psychosis don't got a lot to say
She go let it out, she go let it in, she go let it out
She go let it out, she go let it in, she go let it out

Is it any wonder why princes and kings
Are clowns that caper in their sawdust rings?
Ordinary people that are like you and me
We're the keepers of their destiny
We're the keepers of their destiny, uh

I'm goin', leavin' this city, I'm goin', drivin' outta town
And you're comin' with me, the right time is always now
To go let it out, 'n' go let it in, 'n' go let it out
To go let it out, to go let it in, 'n' go let it out

Is it any wonder why princes and kings
Are clowns that caper in their sawdust rings?
Ordinary people that are like you and me
We're the builders of their destiny
We're the builders of their destiny
We're the builders of their destiny
We're the builders of their destiny

(*whistle*)
So go let it out, go let it in
Go let it out, don't let it in
And go let it out, go let it in
And go let it out, don't let it in, don't let it in, don't let it in
