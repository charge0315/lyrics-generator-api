Ahhh
Hoo
Haa
Hooo
Daylight hurts my eyes
Waking up roadside
Been driving through the night
Feels right moving on
Left you a message
I won’t be coming home
I know your friends are talking bout me now

Don’t  about my groove
I got another  plan
Selfishly I’m where I wanna be
(I’m where I wanna be )
Of Course I understand
Guilty as I am selfishly
I’m happy to be free
Don’t  about my groove
I got another  plan
Selfishly I’m where I wanna be
(I’m where I wanna be )
Of Course I understand
Guilty as I am selfishly
I’m happy to be free
Free, free

It’s time we realize
Another we should have
Than more than getting by
(Good things)
Good things from the past
Can’t keep us holding
(holding)
To a dream that’s real and gone

I know your friends are talking bout me now
Don’t  about my groove
I got another  plan
Selfishly I’m where I wanna be
(I’m where I wanna be )
Of Course I understand
Guilty as I am selfishly
I’m happy to be free
Don’t  about my groove
I got another  plan
Selfishly I’m where I wanna be
(I’m where I wanna be )
Of course I understand
Guilty as I am selfishly
I’m happy to be free

Ahhh
Should have known better
Think it over
The first time
But now it’s over
Can’t stay together
That’s why I had to go

Don’t  about my groove
I got another  plan
Selfishly I’m where I wanna be
(I’m where I wanna be )
Of course I understand
Guilty as I am selfishly
I’m happy to be free
Don’t  about my groove
I got another  plan
Selfishly I’m where I wanna be
(I’m where I wanna be )
Of course I understand
Guilty as I am selfishly
I’m happy to be free

I’m where I wanna be
Gave you the best of me
Ooh oh ohh
I said I’m where I wanna be
(I’m where I wanna be)
Gave you the best of me
Now I’m happy to be free
I’m where I wanna be
(I’m where I wanna be)
Gave you the best of me
Ooh
I said I’m where I wanna be
(I’m where I wanna be)
Gave you the best of me
Now I’m happy to be free
