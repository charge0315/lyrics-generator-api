There was a time in your life
When it was easier livin' all alone
Find yourself livin' on the edge
Of another reason why you can't go home

I got news for you
Nothing's lost if what we have is love

Just someone to catch you when you fall
Is the only thing you wanted at all

You need a hero, someone to rescue you
Yeah, someone that you can run to
You need a hero (You need a hero)
Someone to rescue you (Someone to rescue you)
Don't run away, I'm waitin' to love you

We're just a heartbeat apart
Closer than we've ever been before

I'll be there to catch you when you fall
It's the only thing you wanted at all

You need a hero, someone to rescue you
There's someone that you can run to
You need a hero, someone to rescue you
Don't run away, I'm waitin' to love you

I'll be there to catch you when you fall
It's the only thing you wanted at all

You need a hero, someone to rescue you
Yeah, someone that you can run to
You need a hero (You need a hero)
Someone to rescue you (Someone to rescue you)
Don't run away, don't run away

You need a hero (You need a hero)
Someone to rescue you (Someone to rescue you)
You need a hero (You need a hero)
Someone to rescue you (Someone to rescue you)
Don't run away, I'm here for you
You need a hero, someone to rescue you
You need a hero
