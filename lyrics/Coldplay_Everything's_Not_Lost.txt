When I counted up my demons
Saw there was one for every day
But with the good ones on my shoulders
I drove the other ones away

So if you ever feel neglected
And if you think that all is lost
I'll be countin' up my demons, yeah
Hopin' everything's not lost

When you thought that it was over
You could feel it all around
And everybody's out to get you
Don't you let it drag you down

'Cause if you ever feel neglected
And if you think that all is lost
I'll be countin' up my demons, yeah
Hopin' everything's not lost

If you ever feel neglected
If you think that all is lost
I'll be countin' up my demons, yeah
Hopin' everything's not lost

And singin' out
Oh-oh-oh, yeah, oh-oh, yeah
Oh-oh, yeah, everything's not lost
So come on, yeah, oh-oh, yeah
A-come on, yeah, and everything's not lost
Oh-oh, yeah, oh-oh, yeah
Oh-oh, yeah, and everything's not lost
Come on, yeah, oh-oh, yeah
A-come on, yeah
A-come on, yeah, oh-oh
Yeah, a-come on, yeah, and everything's not lost
Sing out, yeah, oh-oh, yeah
A-come on, yeah, and everything's not lost
Come on, yeah, oh-oh, yeah
Sing out, yeah, and everything's not lost

Now I never meant to do you wrong
That's what I came here to say
But if I was wrong, then I'm sorry
But don't let it stand in our way
'Cause my head just aches when I think of
The things that I shouldn't have done
But life is for livin', we all know
And I don't wanna live it alone

Sing, ah, ah, oh
Sing, ah, ah, oh
And just sing, ah, ah, oh
