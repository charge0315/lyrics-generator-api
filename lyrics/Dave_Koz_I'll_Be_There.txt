I'll be there to comfort you
Build my world of dreams around you
I'm so glad that I found you
I'll be there with a love so strong
I'll be your strength, I'll keep holding on
I'll be there
I'll be there to comfort you
Build my world of dreams around you
I'm so glad that I found you
I'll be there with a love that's strong
I'll be your strength, I'll keep holding on
Just call my name, I'll be there
I'll be there, I'll be there
Just call my name, I'll be there
I'll be there, I'll be there
Just call my name, I'll be there
I'll be there, I'll be there
Just call my name, I'll be there
I'll be there, I'll be there
Just call my name, I'll be there
