When you were mine, I loved you so much
I got a thrill from your every touch
You went away with somebody else
Now all I can say to comfort myself

Is that my girl has gone and said goodbye
But don't you cry, hold your head up high
And don't give up, give love one more try
'Cause there's a right girl for every guy, baby (Oh yeah)

Although your love wasn't right for me
Good for another it well may be
Some girls just weren't made for some guys
Now I've got to make myself realize

That my girl has gone, yes she has (And said goodbye)
But I told myself, now (Don't you cry), hold your head up high
And keep on trying (Don't give up), give love one more try
Believe me now (There's a right) girl for every guy (Oh yeah)

I've got the feelin'
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah baby
Now happiness and all the best
That's all that I wish for you, oh baby
Don't be like me in misery
I'm feelin' sad and I'm blue
I said I'm sad and I'm blue, oh yeah
Sad and I'm blue
I said I'm sad and I'm blue

Because my girl has gone, gone, gone (And said goodbye)
But I tell myself (Don't you cry), hold your head up high
And keep on trying (Don't give up), give love one more try
Believe me now, yeah (There's a right girl for every guy, oh yeah)
And I couldn't go on if I didn't say (Girl has gone), yes, you did (And said goodbye)
And when I start to cry, I say (Don't you cry, hold your head up high)
Ooo wee (Don't give up), give love one more try
You're gonna find out (There's a right girl for every guy, oh yeah)
Now sing the song now, children (Girl has gone and said goodbye)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (Don't you cry, hold your head up high)
