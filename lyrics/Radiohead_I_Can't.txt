Please forget the words that I just blurted out
It wasn't me, it was my strange and creeping doubt
It keeps rattling my cage and there's nothing in this world will keep it down

Even though I might, even though I try, I can't
Even though I might, even though I try, I can't

So many things that keep, that keep me underground
So many words that I, that I can never find

If you give up on me now, I'll be gutted like I've never been before

Even though I might, even though I try, I can't
Even though I might, even though I try, I can't

If you give up on me now, I'll be gutted like I've never been before

Even though I might, even though I try, I can't
Even though I might, even though I try, I can't
Even though I might, even though I try, I can't
Even though I might, even though I try, I can't
