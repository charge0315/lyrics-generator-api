And I’ve been waiting and finally
I can feel you here next to me, next to me
It’s the feeling of your skin
Why don’t you feel me too, me too

Crawling on knives
It’s the thought
Crawling on knives
Just for you

And I’ve been waiting and finally
I can feel you here next to me, next to me
It’s the feeling of your skin
Why don’t you feel me too, me too

Crawling on knives
It’s the thought

It’s like tears from the sun
And it burns with every touch
It’s a glass ceiling
Showing me
It’s like tears from the sun
And it burns with every touch
It’s a glass ceiling
It showing me, it’s showing

Finally I can feel you here next to mе, next to me
It’s the feeling of your skin
Why don’t you feel mе too, me too

Crawling on knives
Just for you

It’s like tears from the sun
And it burns with every touch
It’s a glass ceiling
Showing me
It’s like tears from the sun
And it burns with every touch
It’s a glass ceiling
It showing me, it’s showing

No matter the pain we feel
No matter what they say is real
At least you're here, next to me
No matter the pain we feel
No matter what they say is real
At least you're here, next to me
