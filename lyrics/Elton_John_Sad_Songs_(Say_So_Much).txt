Guess there are times when we all need to share a little pain
And ironin' out the rough spots
Is the hardest part when memories remain
And it's times like these when we all need to hear the radio
'Cause from the lips of some old singer
We can share the troubles we already know

Turn 'em on, turn 'em on
Turn on those sad songs
When all hope is gone (Ah)
Why don't you tune in and turn them on?
They reach into your room, oh-oh-oh, oh
Just feel their gentle touch (Gentle touch)
When all hope is gone (Ooh)
Sad songs say so much

If someone else is sufferin' enough, oh, to write it down
When every single word makes sense
Then it's easier to have those songs around
The kick inside is in the line that finally gets to you
And it feels so good to hurt so bad
And suffer just enough to sing the blues

So turn 'em on, turn 'em on
Turn on those sad songs
When all hope is gone (Ah)
Why don't you tune in and turn them on?
They reach into your room, oh-oh-oh, oh
Just feel their gentle touch (Gentle touch)
When all hope is gone (Ooh)
You know sad songs say so much

Sad songs, they say
Sad songs, they say
Sad songs, they say (Ah)
Sad songs, they say so much

So turn 'em on (Turn 'em on), oh, turn 'em on (Turn 'em on)
Turn on those sad songs (Sad songs)
When all hope is gone (Ah)
Why don't you tune in and turn them on?
They reach into your room, oh-oh-oh, oh
Just feel their gentle touch (Gentle touch)
When all hope is gone (Ooh)
You know sad songs say so much

When all hope is gone
You know sad songs say so much (Ooh, la-la, la-la, ooh, la-la, la-la)
When every little bit of hope is gone
Sad songs say so much (Ooh, la-la, la-la, ooh, la-la, la-la)
When every little bit of hope is gone
Sad songs say so much (Ooh, la-la, la-la, ooh, la-la, la-la)
When all hope is gone
Sad songs say so much (Ooh, la-la, la-la, ooh, la-la, la-la)
When every little bit of hope is gone
Sad songs say so much (Ooh, la-la, la-la, ooh, la-la, la-la)
When everything you do is goin' wrong
Sad songs say so much (Ooh, la-la, la-la, ooh, la-la, la-la)
When every little—
