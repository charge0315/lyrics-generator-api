Boys and girls of every age
Wouldn't you like to see something strange?
Come with us and you will see

Pumpkins scream in the dead of night
This is Halloween, everybody make a scene
Trick or treat 'til the neighbors gonna die of fright

I am the one hiding under your bed
Teeth ground sharp and eyes glowing red
I am the one hiding under your stairs
Fingers like snakes and spiders in my hair
This is Halloween, this is Halloween
Halloween! Halloween! Halloween! Halloween!
In this town, we call home
Everyone, hail to the pumpkin song
In this town, don't we lovе it now?
Everybody's waiting for the next surprisе
Round that corner, man hiding in the trash can
Something's waiting now to pounce, and how you'll

Here in a flash and gone without a trace
I am the “who” when you call, “Who's there?”
I am the wind blowing through your hair
I am the shadow on the moon at night
Filling your dreams to the brim with fright
This is Halloween, this is Halloween
Halloween! Halloween! Halloween! Halloween!
Halloween! Halloween!
