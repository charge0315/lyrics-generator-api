Here again, I know it's coming
That same old feeling
Those days when you feel like a child again
Leave behind all your worries
There's no time for that, no please
The blue sky over my head
Will get you out of bed
(Chorus)
Get yourself together
Cause we've got to make things happen
While there's still time to do it right
You look better now
No doubt about it
You're even smiling just a little bit
That child-like smile is back on your face
I'll take you on a special journey
Don't ask me where it's brand new to me
The black cloud over your head
Is now on its death bed
(Chorus)
Feels like we live in a movie
It's too good to be true
But don't worry
Cause today, today is the day
When the sun wipes everything away
(Chorus)
It's gonna be alright
