One, two, three, four!

I fucked up again, it's all my fault
So turn me around and face the wall
And read me my rights and tell me I am wrong
Until it gets into my thick skull
A slap on the wrist, a stab in the back
Torture me, I've been a bad boy
Nail me to the cross and tell me you have won
I lost before I did any wrong (Shoo!)

Woah-oh

I'm hexed with regrets and bad luck
So keep your distance, it's rubbin' off
Or you will be damned to spend your life in hell
Or on Earth with me tangled at your feet
You finally met your nemesis
Disguised as your fatal long lost love
So kiss it goodbye until death do we part
You fell for a jinx for cryin' out loud

I'm a curse hangin' around you
I'm a curse hangin' around you
I'm a curse hangin' around you
I'm a curse hangin' around you
