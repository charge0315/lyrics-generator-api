Nothin' but a dance, baby, that's for certain
Take another glance at what's behind the curtain
Sweet mystery is calling
The simple truth is right before your eyes
Don't you think it's time you realize
You and me belong together
Right or wrong, through stormy weather

Even if you wonder
Love is still the game
Even if you wonder
Every time
Take it from the top where the cream is risin'
Never gonna stop, you're too tantalizin'
Sweet, can you keep me waiting?
Higher love is not above the law
Got to put my faith in what I saw
Try your best to rearrange
Some things, baby, never gonna change
Chorus (repeat x2)

You don't have to worry, baby
Even if you wonder
My light is shining for you
I'll always be your lover
Oh, higher love is not above the law
I've got to put my faith in what I saw
Even if you wonder (repeat x8)
