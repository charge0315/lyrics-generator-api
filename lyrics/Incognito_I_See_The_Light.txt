It’s an hour from sundown
Another day gone
Reminds me the first time
Lost in your days
I knew your heart was willin’
No question in my mind
Just like the morning breeze
With you I was at ease
All of the loneliness I knew before
Became a distant past
Now I can’t stay in the rain
Without you here to watch it fall

There are no illusions
I see the light
There are no illusions
I see the light

We both came from different worlds
Express ourselves with different words
What you made me feel
Was greater than I’ve ever known
So clear and so obvious
That only a fool could not see
I can’t forget the endearment
For ion that moment
My life began again

There are no illusions
I see the light
There are no illusions
I see the light
Oh I see the light
I see the light
I see the light
