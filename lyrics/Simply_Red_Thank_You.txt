I thank you for the things you have shown me
Thank you for the love of my life
So far anyway, now it's really really over
O God I really thank you baby
Most of all I thank you for your love
Like good people should do anyway
I thank you
I really thank you
All of my life
I really thank you
My souvenirs I hold them and remember
All the days for the rest of my life
Truth is I miss you in all the ways you will imagine
See me, feel me I wanna say
Most of all I thank you for your love
Like good people should do anyway
