Oh my love, my darling
I've hungered for your touch
A long lonely time
Time goes by so slowly
And time can do so much
Are you still mine
I need your love
I need your love
God speed your love to me
Lonely rivers flow
To the sea, to the sea
To the open arms of the sea
And lonely rivers sigh
Wait for me, wait for me
I'll be coming home, wait for me
Oh my love, my darling
I've hungered for your touch
Such a long lonely time
Time goes by so slowly
And time can do so much
Are you still minе
I need your love
I need your love
God speed your love to mе
