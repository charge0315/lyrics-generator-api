Somedays in more ways
I need the distractions
Fire/desire/love and reaction
He must be someone
Yes even me
Something for nothing
Some wish to see
Life beyond reason
Who will I be (who will I be)
I'm afraid of me
I'm afraid of me
Always survive days
Cut and discretion
Touched in a sane way
Leave no impression
He must be someone
Yes even you
Fool my direction
Some wish to see
Love without treason
Who will love me (who will love me)
I'm afraid of me
I'm afraid of me
(afraid to love you)
I'm afraid of me
I'm afraid of me
