Oh Lord, why did you take her from me?
Why didn't you take me away?
So I could have been there beside her
All alone beneath that lonely mound of clay
I stay here beside you little darling
And I promise I'll never go away
Until my life down here is over
Then I'll be with you beneath that mound of clay
Oh Lord, why did you take her from me?
Why didn't you take me away?
So I could have been there beside her
All alone beneath that lonely mound of clay
All alone beneath that lonely mound of clay
