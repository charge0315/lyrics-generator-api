What we finally found wasn't what we wanted (wanted)
Wish I could gone to where we started
Back to black, I can't see what's around me
Back to black, hope to gain some control (gain some control)

I gave up everything

I tried to have it all, now I'm stuck in the middle
I couldn't have it all, now I'm all alone
(Doo, doo, doodoo)
And I've been down and out, now I'm stuck in the middle
I'll never get to say this is enough
(Doo, doo, doodoo)

Now I'm left with nothing
Now I'm left with nothing
Now I'm left with nothing
Now

I gotta take some time
To get this outta my way
No matter how I try to fight it
Nothing changes
Back to black, I can't see what's around me
Back to black, hope to gain some control (gain some control)

I triеd to have it all, now I'm stuck in the middle (I'm stuck in thе middle)
I couldn't have it all, now I'm all alone
(Doo, doo, doodoo)
And I've been down and out, now I'm stuck in the middle (I'm stuck in the middle)
I'll never get to say this is enough
(Doo, doo, doodoo)

(Stuck in the middle, stuck in the middle)
Now I'm left with nothing, now

Now I'm left with nothing
Now I'm left with nothing
Now I'm left with nothing
Now I'm left with nothing

I gave up everything

I tried to have it all, now I'm stuck in the middle
I couldn't have it all, now I'm all alone
(Doo, doo, doodoo)
And I've been down and out, now I'm stuck in the middle (stuck in the middle)
I'll never get to say this is enough
(Doo, doo, doodoo)

Now I'm left with nothing
Now I'm left with nothing
Now I'm left nothing
Now

Now I'm left with nothing
Now I'm left with nothing
Now I'm left with nothing
Now I'm left with nothing
