Ooh, don't stop until the morning comes
Ooh, don't stop until the morning comes
Ooh, don't stop
It's 12 o'clock and now you gotta hit the streets
'Cause you don't wanna be alone
Dress your best so all the guys will compete
For a chance to take you home
You really look so chic
You're the main attraction of the night
Many eyes will be staring at you
'Cause you know how to shake it right
Ooh, don't stop until the morning comes
Ooh, don't stop until the morning comes
('Til the morning comes)
Ooh, don't stop
You're in the groove that rocks the place just right
The fellas love the way you move
Tell me, will it be me that'll hold you tonight?
I'm chasing hard after you
Now you've been on your feet
As if the party would never end
Tell me, what will you do at the edge of the night
When the music stops and the love begins?
Ooh, don't stop until the morning comes
(Stay with me tonight)
Ooh, don't stop until the morning comes
Ooh, don't stop until the morning comes
(All the way from midnight to daylight)
Ooh, don't stop until the morning comes
(Until daylight, oh yeah)
(I just wanna get it on, just wanna get it)
I wanna get it on
Oh baby
Ooh, don't stop (Don't stop)
Ooh, don't stop (Don't stop)
Don't stop my love
Ooh, don't stop (Don't stop)
Ooh, don't stop (Don't stop)
Don't stop my love
Ooh, don't stop until the morning comes
(Not until the morning comes)
Ooh, don't stop until the morning comes
Ooh, don't stop until the morning comes
(All the way from midnight to daylight)
Ooh, don't stop until the morning comes
(Hey) Ooh, don't stop until the morning comes
(Keep it going on and on and on)
Ooh, don't stop until the morning comes
('Til the morning comes)
