Well, I woke up to the sound of silence
The cars were cutting like knives in a fistfight
And I found you with a bottle of wine
Your head in the curtains and heart like the fourth of July
You swore and said, "We are not, we are not shining stars"
This I know, I never said we are
Though I've never been through hell like that
I've closed enough windows to know you can never look back

If you're lost and alone, or you're sinkin' like a stone
Carry on
May your past be the sound of your feet upon the ground
Carry on
Carry on, carry on

So I met up with some friends at the edge of the night
At a bar off 75
And we talked and talked about how our parents will die
All our neighbors and wives
But I'd like to think I can cheat it all
To make up for the times I've been cheated on
And it's nice to know when I was left for dead
I was found and now I don't roam these streets
I am not the ghost you are to me

If you're lost and alone, or you're sinkin' like a stone
Carry on
May your past be the sound of your feet upon the ground and
Carry on

Woah, my head is on fire, but my legs are fine
After all, they are mine
Lay your clothes down on the floor
Close the door, hold the phones
Show me how no one's ever gonna stop us now

'Cause we are, we are shining stars
We are invincible, we are who we are
On our darkest day, when we're miles away
So we'll come, we will find our way home

If you're lost and alone, or you're sinkin' like a stone
Carry on
May your past be the sound of your feet upon the ground and
Carry on

(No one's ever gonna stop us now)
(No one's ever gonna stop us now)
(No one's ever gonna stop us now)
