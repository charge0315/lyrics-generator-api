How did I get here? Think I know what I did
Always worked real hard, maybe I missed something
I'm not into pointin' fingers, showin' who's right or wrong
I just wanna keep it real 'cause maybe I was doin' fine on my own

Listen, I had a career before, now didn't I?
I had lots of friends before, now didn't I?
And I had my fans before, now didn't I?
And I had my family before, now didn't I?

Guess without you
My little life was nothing, but don't sweat it
Let's say we disagree, so
Arguing ain't necessary 'cause we both have our whole lives left to live
We're both consumed with jealousy ('Sumed)
But the truth can set you free

Don't act like you don't know the truth (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
'Cause deep down in your heart you do, let it go (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Ooh child, things are gonna get easier
Ooh child, things will be bright 'cause truth will set you free

Conversation's deep when you talk to yourself
There's no way to cheat, 'cause you know you can't be no one else
Won't trip out on disappointments 'cause failure is just not me
Still I gotta do my job 'cause you know my show can't go on without me

Listen, I had a career before, now didn't I?
Sold out around the world before, now didn't I?
I had a few hits before, now didn't I?
And danced until my feet were sore, now didn't I?

Guess without you
Oh, my little life was nothing, but don't sweat it
Let's say we disagree, so
Arguing ain't necessary 'cause we both have our whole lives left to live
Guess we're consumed with jealousy, yeah ('Sumed)
But the truth can set you free

Don't act like you don't know the truth (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
'Cause deep down in your heart you do, let it go (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Ooh child, things are gonna get easier
Ooh child, things will be bright 'cause truth will set you free

It's hard to believe the love between us is over
It's sad to think we couldn't work it out but
How much is enough to pay for this mistake?
Hope your love was sincere

Don't act like you don't know the truth (Don't act like you don't know the truth, baby)
'Cause deep down in your heart you do ('Cause deep down in your heart you do, you know you do)
Ooh child, things are gonna get easier (Get easier)
Ooh child, things will be ooh, ooh (Truth will set you free)
Don't act like you don't know the truth (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
'Cause deep down in your heart you do (Can set you free, can set you free)
Ooh child, yeah, yeah, yeah (Things are gonna get easier)
Ooh, ooh

Do you know the truth? (Truth)
Feel it, live it (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Do you know the truth? (Truth)
Trust it, believe it (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Do you know the truth? (Truth)
You want it, and need it (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Do you know truth? (Truth)
Find it, embrace it (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
And never let go
(Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah)
(Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah) It'll set you free
(Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah)
(Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah) It'll set you free
(Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah)
(Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah) It'll set you free
