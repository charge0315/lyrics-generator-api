Shake a leg
Shake a leg
Why, why do you stand aside
You shouldn't miss the fun
Why don't you try
Sway, your body as I say
And in a little while you feel o'key
Warming up, cooling down
Warming up, cooling down
One-two-three-four-five-six-seven-eight
Dance, dance, dance
Dancing for your body
Dance, dance, dance
Don't give up until you've got it
Dance, dance, dance
Dancing for your body
Dance, dance, dance
Work it out let everybody dance
Oh what a wonderful chance
To be beautiful
Dance, dance, dance... dance
Shake a leg
Look, no time to read a book
Aerobic dancing has you on the hook
Learn, if you go for the burn
Your body's gonna thank you in return
Warming up, cooling down
Warming up, cooling down
One-two-three-four-five-six-seven-eight
Shake a leg
Cross-cross, one-two-three-four
Step-step, clock-clock, fall to the floor
Shake a leg
Contract, one-two-three-four
Kick, change, kick, change
In-out, in-out
Cross-cross, clock-clock, one-two-three-four
Dance, dance, dance
Dancing for you body
Dance, dance, dance
Don't give up until you've got it
Dance, dance, dance
Dancing for your body
Dance, dance, dance
Work it out let everybody
