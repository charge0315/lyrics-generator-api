To love somebody naturally
To love somebody faithfully
To love somebody equally
Is not enough
Is not enough
Is not enough

To love somebody secretly (And never touch)
To love somebody honestly (And always trust)
To love somebody tenderly
The tender touch
Is not enough
It's not enough

Love hurts you sometimes
It's not so easy to find, no
Searchin' everywhere
You turn and swear
It's always been there

To love somebody foolishly (Can happen once)
To love somebody hopelessly (It hurts so much)
To love somebody equally
Is not enough
Is not enough
Is not enough

Love takes a little time
It's not so easy to find, no
Searchin' everywhere
You turn and swear
She's always been there
Standin' there

Oh

And if it don't come easily
One thing you must believe
You can always have trust in me
'Cause my heart will always be
Yours honestly

Yeah, love hurts you sometimes
Not so easy to find, no
Searchin' everywhere
Then turn and swear
It's always been there
Standin' there
Love hurts you sometimes
It's not yours, it's not mine, no
Love is only to share
Turn and swear
It's everywhere
Standin' there
'Cause it's always been there
