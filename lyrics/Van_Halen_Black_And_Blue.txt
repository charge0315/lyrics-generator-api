Hey!

Mmm, slip n' slide, push it in
Uh, bitch sure got the rhythm
I'm holding back, yeah, I got control

Honey, I ain't through with you
Uh, the harder, the better
Do it 'til we're black and blue

A little bit of everything, oh, even when it hurts, uh
Sure feels good, wow! Uh

Got to, got to, got to make it right
Ow! Come on, baby, get it
Black and blue, wow-oh

Wow!
