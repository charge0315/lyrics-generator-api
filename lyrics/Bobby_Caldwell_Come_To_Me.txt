Come to me
Let me hold you in my arms
Darling tonight, come to me
Come to me, there's no need to stay
Alone this way, baby, come to me
Let me love you, honey
Keep you warm, holding you tight
Come to me, come to me
All your cares will be history
Come to me, come to me
I would never mistreat you
I would always, always be around
In this world, you'll need someone
I will never let you down, come to me
Let me love you, honey
In my arms, darling tonight
Come to me, come to me
All your cares will be history when you come to me
