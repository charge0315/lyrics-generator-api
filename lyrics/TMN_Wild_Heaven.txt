Blood of a promise
Is dripping from your lips
Sugar in the gas
The evil takes its sips
Progression's fading
Slain by deadly lies
Perfect shaving
The sheeps will pay the price
Your convictions
Changing like your tie
Outrageous fiction
Your suit comes with a lie
Black is the shape of your heart
You fall to fire
Step by step, part by part
Caught in darkness
The poison in your heart
Made up stories
Your everlasting art
Cannonball Tongue
One step forward
And two steps going back
Specialized in sit-outs
Your way of attack
Ostrich behaviour
Head deep in the sand
Trivial phrases
Empty of content
Black is the shape of your heart
You fall to fire
Step by step, part by part
Caught in darkness
The poison in your heart
Made up stories
Your everlasting art
Black is the shape of your heart
You fall to fire
Step by step, part by part
Caught in darkness
The poison in your heart
Made up stories
Your everlasting art
Caught in darkness
The poison in your heart
Made up stories
Your everlasting art
Cannonball Tongue
