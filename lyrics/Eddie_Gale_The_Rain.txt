When the rain begins to fall
I must leave, so so long
Though I go, I want you to know
Though I leave you, I'll not deceive you
Wipe the tears away from your eyes
Stop the rain

When the rain begins to fall
I must leave, so so long
Though I go, I want you to know
Though I leave you, I'll not deceive you
Wipe the tears away from your eyes
Stop the rain

On a day of sun and wind
Destined to return again
And the day'll be long and bright
Lingering on into the night
Everything will be alright
Stop the rain

On a day of sun and wind
Destined to return again
And the day'll be long and bright
Lingering on into the night
Everything will be alright
Stop the rain

(When the rain) Stop the rain

When the rain begins to fall
I must leave, so so long
Though I go, I want you to know
Though I leave you, I'll not deceive you
Wipe the tears away from your eyes
Stop the rain

(Stop the rain) Stop the rain
(Stop the rain) When the rain
