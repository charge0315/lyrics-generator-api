Maybe you've been pouring everything into this from a state of bliss
It turns to agony
You can't predict this
When it comes to it
You can't hide from me
But don't you surrender anything

Don't you know that
That patience is a virtue
And life is a waiting game
Don't you know that
Peace must be nurtured
And all the money in the world can buy you nothing

All these things happen
All these things happen for a reason
Don't you go and throw it all away
Get yours when the seasons change

Hurts me to see you feel this way but it won't be always
Don't you know everything got to change
Feel like all your hope is gone
You can't carry on
But there's nothing wrong
You don't have to pretend with me

Don't you know that
That patience is a virtue
And life is a waiting game
Don't you know that
Peace must be nurtured
And all the money in the world can buy you nothing

All these things happen
All these things happen for a reason
Don't you go and throw it all away
Get yours when the seasons change
