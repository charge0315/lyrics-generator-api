Take me back to that moment when
I stopped feeling anything
Not even
The sound of you breathing
It really felt like we were out of time
Take me back
Take me back to these moments
When we're out of time
Take me back to these moments
When we're out of time
Take me back to that moment when
I stopped feeling anything
Not even (Not even)
The sound of you breathing
I really love when we are out of time
Take me back
