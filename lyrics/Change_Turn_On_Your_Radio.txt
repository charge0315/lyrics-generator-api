Everywhere I go I try to find her once again
Just to say hello and talk about the good times
Baby, don't you know I need you?
Searching all around I can't believe you went away
You drifted with the crowd
Impossible to see you, ooh yeah
Strolling through the night, I gotta find you now
The only thing to do to get my message through
Turn on your radio
Turn on your radio
Turn on your radio
Turn on your radio-o-o
Everywhere I go something reminds me of the time when everything was fine
Why'd you go and leave me?
Wandering alone, I need you back at home
The only thing to do to get my message through
Turn on your radio
Turn on your radio
Turn on your radio
Turn on your radio-o-o
Turn on your radio
Turn on your radio
Turn on your radio
Turn on your radio-o-o
Turn on your radio
Turn on your radio
Turn on your radio
Turn on your radio-o-o
Turn on your radio
Turn on your radio-o-o
Turn on your radio
Turn on your radio-o-o
Turn on your radio
Turn on your radio-o-o
