Pump up the peculiar
While I yell unique
If you’re wondering what it look like, look at me
Ah, ah, let me show you to do it
Hey-ey, a-haha!
Ooooh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

I'm well on my way
I'm almost everything
And this is my day
You make me want to say

I'm free! Look at me!
Behold everything I'm allowed to see
Free! Come and see
Na, na, na, na, look at me

The shapeless, formless, heart is enormous
Bore this, I've worn this, no never what the norm is
Come hear this, it's fearless
Contrast, colour, prisms, so warmin'
Listen and love it!

I'm freeee! Look at me!
Freedom in hi-fidelity
Free! Come and see
Na, na, na, na, na na na

What you waitin' on?
I won't ask your passion, smilin', laughin'
Yieldin', feelin', helpin', healin'
Introduce your neighbor to your savior

I'm free! Look at me!
Freedom in hi-fidelity
Free!
Na, na, na, na, na na na
