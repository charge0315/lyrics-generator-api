Dancing at your apartment
Under electric lights
Sneaking out of this party
Running into the night
The sky is all crystal
We’re animate we’re intimate we’re wild
And right at this moment
I can see the past and future in your eyes
Oh why?
Anytime I feel this rush
I’m overwhelmed
It’s chemical
I don’t know why
I don’t know why
You make me dream in ice cream colours
Crystal waves
Through my brain
I don’t know why
I don’t know why
Lying out in the sunlight
Swimming in golden rays
Our days go by so slowly
But the nights spin fast
My senses ablaze
I’m making a collage
I’m taken with the possibilities
You pull me in closer
And happiness is burning like a neon dream
Oh why?
Anytime I feel this rush
I’m overwhelmed
It’s chemical
I don’t know why
I don’t know why
You make me dream in ice cream colours
Crystal waves
Through my brain
I don’t know why
I don’t know why
The distance I’ve traveled
The distance is immeasurable in time
But none of that matters
When I can see the past and future
In your eyes, oh why?
Anytime I feel this rush
I’m overwhelmed
It’s chemical
I don’t know why
I don’t know why
You make me dream in ice cream colours
Crystal waves
Through my brain
I don’t know why
I don’t know why
