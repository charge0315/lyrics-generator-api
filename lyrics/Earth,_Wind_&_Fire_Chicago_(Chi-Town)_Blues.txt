Booker T's at the front door saying it's time to go
Coltrane's at the Mother Blues tonight
63rd to South Shore
We're cruising in the Dyna-Flo
Ain't no way they'll let us play, but then, they might
Fourteen years, not a one day more, yeah
Struttin' my stuff up and down the floor
Haven't you heard this groove before?

Ba da bop ba di-ya ba di-ya
Ba da bop bop ba do-ah do-ay
I'll never lose Chicago blues
Ba da bop bop ba do-ah do-ay
We tried to be cool, ooo, yeah
Flat tops up, stove-pipes down
Finding out the good stuff
You never gonna learn in school
Comes easy in this part of town
I brought my sticks, we're sittin' in all night
Better be quick, gotta hold on tight
It's gonna be a real jam down delight

Ba da bop ba di-ya ba di-ya
Ba da bop bop ba do-ah do-ay
I'll never lose Chicago blues
Send that drummer home and
Let me play
Ba da bop ba di-ya ba di-ya
Ba da bop bop ba do-ah do-ay
Ee-yay ee-yeay ee-yay ee-yay
Send that drummer home and
Let me play
Ba di-ya ba di-ya
Ba da bop bop ba do-ah do-ay
Ee-yay ee-yeay ee-yay ee-yay
Send that drummer home and
Let me play
Ba da bop ba di-ya ba di-ya
Ba da bop bop ba do-ah do-ay
Ee-yay ee-yeay ee-yay ee-yay
Ba da bop bop ba do-ah do-ay
