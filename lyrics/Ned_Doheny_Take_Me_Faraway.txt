Faraway, you're old enough to know
I've seen it in your eyes
Each time we speak of paradise
There's a beast on the move
You've got to hold that groove
I'm near you when you pray
Take me faraway
Faraway upon a distant shore
Voices in the wind
Whisper of their sacred sin
There's a hole in this world
Through which we both might crawl
I'm with you when you say
Take me faraway
Make it easy
Make it soon
I'm so weary
Of hotels and else
Dime-a-dance saloons
I want to be faraway
Like shells beside the sea
That tumble in the sand
And sleep where ancient rivers ran
There's a chair on a hill
If you've got time to give
It's easy when you say
Take me faraway
Further on, the breaking of the dawn
An ordinary friend can bring you to your journey's end
To that place in the sky
Where all the colors fly
It happens everyday
Take me faraway
Happens when you say
Take me faraway
Take me faraway
Take me faraway
Take me faraway
