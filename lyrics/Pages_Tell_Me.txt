I've played many lovers in a hundred lonely scenes
Acting out a fool of passion
I was always trying to act accordingly
But love was something I imagined
I was wrong, so wrong, please tell me, tell me, do you love me, tell me
I wanna be your lover, not an ordinary friend
'Cause lovers I'm told make love
I can't run for cover, I keep runnin' back again
Oh it never seems I'll ever get enough
I can't let go, oh no, please tell me, tell me, do you want me, tell me
Do you love me (I stand alone outside the light)
Tell me (that leads its way into your life)
Do you need me (I need your love, I can't let go)
Tell me (I'm here for you forever)
(Solo)
Tell me I'm the lover you picture in your dreams
Let me be the one you turn to
Tell me there's no other in your heart to see
Come on give it up, I'm here to love you
I can't let go, oh no, please tell me (I stand alone outside the light)
Tell me (that leads its way into your life)
Do you want me (I need your love, I can't let go)
Tell me (I'm here for you forever)
Do you love me (I stand alone outside the light)
Tell me (that leads its way into your life)
Do you need me (I need your love, I can't let go)
Tell me (I'm here for you forevermore)
Do you love me (I stand alone outside the light)
Tell me (that leads its way into your life)... (to fade)
