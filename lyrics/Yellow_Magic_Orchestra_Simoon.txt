Hot starlight there are three moons
Dreams of a sheikh and she steals a night kiss
There is a belly dance
Mirage romance in Casablanca

Frankincense in the tresses of her hair
They ride the night on white mare
Her perfume drifts
On the Arabian air from the heart of the harem

He carries her off down to palm-breeze oasis
Behind a sand dune croons
She with her Eastern promise
Secrets in the sand
Oh, she's only a desert song

He carries her off down to palm-breeze oasis
Behind a sand dune croons
She with her Eastern promise
Secrets in the sand
Oh, she's only a desert song

Ooh, Simoon
Ooh, ooh, ooh, Simoon
Ooh, Simoon
Ooh, ooh, ooh, Simoon
Ooh, Simoon
Ooh, ooh, ooh, Simoon
Ooh, Simoon
Ooh, ooh, ooh, Simoon
Ooh, Simoon
Ooh, ooh, ooh, Simoon
