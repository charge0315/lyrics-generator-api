Redeeming my soul, I'm still awaiting
Interrupt and get struck
When my veins are willing to rise, I get mad
My cat got
But I didn't get mad or got had, I got with him
Try to tenderize,  like venom
But wait  hit em
Run em up, succumb to the
A+ don't be giving a mother fuck
Psycho Drama, nigga, what
Into your head with the scriptures
Internet, son of a bitches, you lames come with bullshit
The  get bagged
The lips of the Lucifer fix it, the rest of my shit, I'm pitching a fit
Cause bullshit niggas doing half-assed jobs getting had
That black mask and that mag gonna save my ass
If I succumb to, then fuck it, then I ain't got shit tight, nigga
I'll pop that holster bеcause you gonna show bloods you right
On time, when it gеts
Your shit is getting lethal when they wanna break my stride
And ah, nobody gunna break me down
You gotta pick up the nine, niggas staggering
And now you stuttering, get your shit together, G

You staggering, now you stuttering, get your shit together, G
Money talks, bullshit walks, and you and that bullshit better be
Recognize it, true niggas in your presence, this is real, bitch
You bleed formaldehyde fucking with this ill shit

My lyrics be scandalous
As an open handed slaps from children to parents
And apparently de-transparent
Mother fucker can't understand it
 with shit to speak
Gave some shit to tweak off of, I hope I don't get to deep
Now check it
Inflicted pain graphic enough to be in a picture frame
Lyrics out to get you mane, and you can't get shit to tame
Silver frame from all that shit you talking, kid
Staggering, stuttering, gave em a casket is what I went off and did
Who'd you think you fucking with?
And plus it's Psycho Drama fucking your dreams up
And sons is hating, how Long Island and Chicago teamed up?
Such a beam up
And call your mother fucking hero
In the scenes what is an
Went from a hundred to a fucking zero
Cuz a  and I don't see no reason to quit
Unstable as I am, I really don't need no reason for shit
It's a season for this
Paper chasing, bludgeoning, uncovering
Us thugs gonna do the fucking governing
Leave you staggering and stuttering

Graphic as hands in a basket
 is this perfect
 two bad nurses, what you working with
Until the fucking curtains close, I ain't gonna stop this hurting, hoes
Until the dirt
In my berserking mode, I'm ignant
Bringing death to their wishes
How dare you test the bridges  the expeditious
I'm bringing the wet to fishes
Intent, infected, vicious, brain in the mix
The malicious and ignant motherfuckers
Is what I'm claiming and shit, we vultures
Cultures of repulsive clusters, sedative instinct
Dependent on the money that God provide us
Fuck what the men think, on a thin brink of reality
I don't wanna battle me so I know you don't, bitch
And casting a spell on those motherfuckers who sat on me
I got this problem with channeling anger
Strange but I change too
Similar to David Banner in danger or that kid in the manger
Anything to be more specific about my decryptive picture
And elixirs can't help see no different
These my unstable scriptures
