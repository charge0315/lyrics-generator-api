I always thought it would be easier
After you were gone
Thought I could pull myself together
And do fine on my own
Sometimes I do alright, then I remember
How I dreamed it, how I needed it
I thought it would be easier
I thought it would be easier
They never told me I'd be lonely
Torn up and wasted
But when you saw something
Else you liked
You couldn't wait to taste it
How was I to know about the way
You were scheming I guess I must have been dreaming
I thought it would be easier
I thought it would be easier
I found that old shirt you used to wear
And it really brought me down
Ooh does she like blue like I do
I bet she gets around
All I know today is that I
I can't stand it, this ain't how I planned it
I thought it would be easier
I thought it would be easier
