I wasn't always on this road
Though it seems like I've been gone forever
Now it's too late for me to turn around
The sun is fading fast
I never thought I could catch that train
You know a man can't spend his whole life running
Oh bless my soul
I hear a whistle blow
It can't be far ahead
How long did you think this would last
Brother, I don't know
How long does this moment prevail
Now and forever more
I never thought I could find my place
And I guess I've spent my whole life waiting
That freedom calls
Beyond these prison walls
It calls for you
