I've been watchin my TV
It's got a hundred different stations
They all look the same to me
Now I'm ready
For a new sensation
Na na na na na
Na na na na
Na na na na
I'm gettin ready for the big time
Someday I'm gonna be big time news
Dont have to take it when you're big time
Someday you'll call me mister big time too
In a big reclining chair
With a cold six pack of beer
You got a front row seat
You got to put up your feet
Man the picture
Is lookin bright from here
I'm gettin ready for the big time
Someday I'm gonna be big time news
I can taste it, I'll be prime time
Someday I'm gonna be big time news
Don't have to take it when you're big time
Someday you'll call me mister big time too
Na na na na na
Na na na na
Na na na na
I'm gettin ready for the big time
Someday I'm gonna be big time news
I'm gonna waste it when I'm big time
I'll be ready for it, bing bang boom
I can taste it I'll be prime time
Someday I'm gonna be big time news
Don't have to take it when you're big time
Someday you'll call me mister big time too
