I saw your manhood risin'
'Cause you were fantasizin'
I guess that model in the lingerie got you excited
At night when I crawl in bed
Wearing that same teddy bear
You only said I love you
Kissed me then rolled over and slept

Damn, is that all I get from you?
'Bout to give me an attitude
You need to make love to me
Like you don't love me then
Don't have to be gentle tonight
Just be an animal tonight
You need to make love to me
Like you don't love me

Just do me, baby
Come on and drive me crazy
Act like I'm not your lady
Do me like you wanna do them other girls
Just do me, baby
Come on and drive me crazy
Act like I'm not your lady
Do me like you wanna do them other girls

Why you been tellin' your boys
How you been breakin' me off?
Must be somebody else who's back you broke
'Cause I didn't get none
You're up at three in the 'morn
Watchin' that triple X porn
But you're so tired when you make love to me
What did you learn?

Damn, is that all I get from you?
'Bout to give me an attitude
You need to make love to me
Like you don't love me then
Don't have to be gentle tonight
Just be an animal tonight
You need to make love to me
Like you don't love me

Just do me, baby
Come on and drive me crazy
Act like I'm not your lady
Do me like you wanna do them other girls
Just do me, baby
Come on and drive me crazy
Act like I'm not your lady
Do me like you wanna do them other girls

Do me, baby (Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do)
Do me, baby (Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do)
Do me, baby (Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do)
(Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do)
(That's right, home on)
(Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do)
(Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do)
(Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do)
(Hit it like this, baby)

Do me, baby
Come on and drive me crazy
Act like I'm not your lady
Do me like you wanna do them other girls
Just do me, baby
Come on and drive me crazy
Act like I'm not your lady
Do me like you wanna do them other girls

When you look at me, do you want me, just for what you see?
Do you think I am that person that you watch on TV?
There's another side, that I don't hide
But may never show
Damita Jo
Thank you
