5 a.m., rise and shine
To feed the baby before he starts to cry
No rest and time to play
Fifteen, the mother is a runaway
No time for dreams or goals
Pressure is so strong
Her body she has sold
So her child can eat

What is happenin' to this world we live in
In our home and other lands?

Drugs and crime spreadin' on the street
People can't find enough to eat
Now our kids can't go out and play
That's the state of the world today
State of the world
Ooh, baby
(Drugs and crime)

Lil' Johnny, all alone
His only friend, the doll he carries with him
Goes to school each and every day
To be teased because he has no place to stay
This young, homeless boy feels his life is worthless
Instead of suicide, he cries himself to sleep

And it's happenin' to this world we live in
There's got to be a better way, ooh-ooh

Drugs and crime spreadin' on the street
People can't find enough to eat
Now our kids can't go out and play
That's the state of the world today
State of the world
Ooh-ooh-ooh (

Can't give up hope now
Let's weather the storm to-together

Drugs and crime spreadin' on the street
People can't find enough to eat
Now our kids can't go out and play
That's the state of the world today
Drugs and crime spreadin' on the street
People can't find enough to eat
Now our kids can't go out and play
That's the state of the world today
Drugs and crime spreadin' on the street (Crime)

People can't find enough to eat (Can't find enough to eat)
(Stop it people)
Now our kids can't go out and play (Kids can't go out and play)

That's the state of the world today (Don't give up)
