You ask me if there'll come a time
When I grow tired of you
Never my love
Never my love
You wonder if this heart of mine
Will lose it's desire for you
Never my love (never my love)
Never my love
What makes you think love will end
When you know
That my whole life depends on you
Never my love
Never my love
You say you fear I'll change my mind
And I won't require you
Never my love, no
Never, never my love
Now how can you think love will end
When I've asked you to spend
Your whole life with me (with me)
Never my love
Never my love
Never my love
Never my love
I need you
Never my love
Oh, believe me, baby
I want you forever and ever, my love
I wanna be
