You keep an open mind
Shining like the sun
Light the sea light the sky
Neither old nor young
You wanted to be free
Now you're free to run
Free to live free to love
Neither old nor young
What if I were bold
And crossed into your light
Do you think that would that be alright?
Out there in the cold
Nothing stands a chance
All I've ever known are broken plans
Luck is on your side
But do you know which one
Destiny or design?
Neither old nor young
Neither old nor young
Neither old nor young
Neither old nor young
