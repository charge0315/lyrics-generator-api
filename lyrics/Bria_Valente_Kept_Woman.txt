I was only 17 when he saw me
The apple of my daddy's eye
Cute but not jaded, my hair in two braids
He looked at me and just said "Hi"
Was it his cologne or the style of his hair?
They told me I should stay away and not go there
Sometimes I'm all alone and don't see him
I wish it was different but I don't care

I'm a kept woman
He don't see nobody but me (See nobody but me)
We got a pretty little house
And only me and him got the key (Got the key)
A kept woman
Sometimes I don't know why
A kept woman
Sometimes I cry

He likes it when I dance for no reason
He likes it when I dance
But he doesn't like it when I raise my voice to him (Raise my voice)
I try to stop but I can't (I can't)
Was it his cologne or the style of his hair?
I don't know how but he took me there
And now I hug my pillow more nights than not
It's crazy but the butterflies just don't stop

'Cause I'm a kept woman
He don't see nobody but me (Nobody)
We got a pretty little house
And only me and him got the key
A kept woman
Sometimes I don't know why
A kept woman
Sometimes I cry, yeah yeah
Kept woman
Kept woman

He's the hotness in my fire
I give him anything he desires
It may sound crazy but it suits me fine
'Cause ain't nobody ever take away what's mine

'Cause I'm a kept woman (Kept woman)
'Cause he's every single thing I need (Spiritual, physical)
Kept woman (Chemical, emotional)
And everything in between
Don't you know that I'm a kept woman (Kept woman)
Ooh loves me like no other
A love you never seen
I'm a kept woman
And I'm his queen

Yes I am, oh yes I am
And I don't care, no
Kept woman, I don't care (No)
Kept woman, I don't care (Uh-uh)
Kept woman, I don't care (Don't care)
