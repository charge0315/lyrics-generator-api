It's a party with my stereo
Songs from 50 years ago
The quickest way to travel time
Is music and some cheap read wine
This old house is fast asleep
So I'm trying not to tap my feet
Two musicians who have long since passed
But still alive inside these tracks
This is a mystery
How you wrote a song for me
In Nineteen Sixty Three
For someone you'd never meet
For someone who needed you
To help make it through
So in my gratitude
I wrote a song for you
I wrote this song for you
I shut the door and turn the lock
The last lights out on the whole block
From memory I climb the stairs
Say goodnight to all the old ghosts there
This is a mystery
How you wrote a song for me
In Nineteen Sixty Three
For someone you'd never meet
For someone who needed you
To help make it through
So in my gratitude
I wrote a song for you
Yeah, I wrote this song for you
I wrote a song
I wrote a song
I wrote for you
For someone who needed you
Oh ohhh
So in my gratitude
Oh ohhh
This is a mystery
Ooh oooooohhh
Oh ohhh
Oh ohhh
