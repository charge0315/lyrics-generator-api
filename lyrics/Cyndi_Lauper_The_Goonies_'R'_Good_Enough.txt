Here we are, hanging onto strains of greed and blues
Break the chain, then we break down
Oh, it's not real if you don't feel it

Unspoken expectations
Ideals you used to play with
They've finally taken shape

What's good enough (Good enough)
For you, it's good enough (Good enough)
For me, it's good enough (Good enough)
It's good enough for me
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Now you'll say you're startin' to feel the push and pull
Of what could be and never can
You mirror me, stumblin' through those

Old fashioned superstitions
I find it too hard to break
Oh, maybe you're out of place

What's good enough (Good enough)
For you, it's good enough (Good enough)
For me, it's good enough (Good enough)
It's good enough for me
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Good enough (good enough)
For you, it's good enough (Good enough)
For me, it's good enough (Good enough)
It's good enough for me
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Old fashioned superstitions
I find it too hard to break
Oh, maybe you're out of place

What's good enough (Good enough)
For you, it's good enough (Good enough)
For me, it's good enough (Good enough)
It's good enough for me
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Good enough (good enough)
For you, it's good enough (Good enough)
For me, it's good enough (Good enough)
It's good enough for me
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

(Good enough for you, it's...)
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, oh
(Good enough for me, it's...)
Ah-ha
(Good enough)
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
