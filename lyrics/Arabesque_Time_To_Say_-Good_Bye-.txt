Why did I believe you on a lonely summer night
That forever you would hold me tight
And why did I believe you as you slowly turned the light
You would never leave me late at night
Night and day I'm sitting here and I'm waiting, waiting
Night and day till I hear myself saying:
Time to say "good bye"
But I'll love you till I die
And when you look into my eyes
I know why I can't say "good bye"
Time to say "good bye"
But I'll love you till I die
And when you look into my eyes
I know why I can't say "good bye"
Could I live without you
Could I really close the door
With that real love forever more
Could I live without you
He's the man who shut the door
He's the only one I'm waiting for
Night and day I'm sitting here and I'm waiting, waiting
Night and day till I hear myself saying:
Time to say "good bye"
But I'll love you till I die
And when you look into my eyes
I know why I can't say "good bye"
Time to say "good bye"
But I'll love you till I die
And when you look into my eyes
I know why I can't say "good bye"
Listen, you don't need no alibi
Listen, never try to tell a lie
Time to say "good bye"
But I'll love you till I die
And when you look into my eyes
I know why I can't say "good bye"
Time to say "good bye"
But I'll love you till I die
And when you look into my eyes
I know why I can't say "good by
Time to say "good bye"
But I'll love you till I die
