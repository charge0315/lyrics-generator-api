Find yourself in the gutter
In a lonely part of town
Where death waits in the darkness
With a weapon to cut some stranger down
Sleeping with an empty bottle
He's a sad and an empty hearted man
All he needs is a job, and a little respect
So he can get out while he can

We always need to hear both sides of the story
Both sides of the story

A neighbourhood peace is shattered
It's the middle of the night
Young faces hide in the shadows
While they watch their mother and father fight
He says she's been unfaithful
She says her love for him has gone
And the brother shrugs to his sister and says
"Looks like it's just us from now on"

Oh, we always need to hear both sides of the story
We need to hear both sides of the story

And the lights are all on
The world is watching now
People looking for truth
We must not fail them now
Be sure, before we close our eyes
Don't walk away from here
Until you hear both sides
No, no, no, no

Here we are all gathered
In what seems to be the center of the storm
Neighbours once friendly now stand each side
Of the line that has been drawn
They've been fighting here for years
But now there's killing on the streets
While small coffins are lined up sadly
Now united in defeat

Oh, we always need to hear both sides of the story

And the lights are all on
The world is watching now
People looking for truth
We must not fail them now
Be sure, before we close our eyes
Don't walk away from here
Until you see both sides
No, no, no, no, no, no

White man turns the corner
Finds himself within a different world
Ghetto kid grabs his shoulder
Throws him up against the wall
He says, "Would you respect me
If I didn't have this gun?
Because without it, I don't get it
And that's why I carry one"

We always need to hear both sides of the story
Both sides of the story

Oh, both sides of the story
Yes, both sides of the story
Oh, both sides of the story
Both sides of the story
Both sides of the story
Both sides, both sides of the story
Both sides of the story
Ooh, both sides of the story, yeah, yeah
Both sides of the story
Both sides, both sides of the story
Both sides of the story
Both sides of the story
Both sides of the story
Must hear both sides of the story
