Tender is the light that shines on you
Gentle is the morning made anew
Delicate, the grace we’ve come into
My love
Wonder why you wish your life away
Waiting for the perfect boat to take
Waiting for the perfect wind to sail away

Life’s shining around you
Don’t miss a day
If you’re caught up in the chase
You hold your happiness away from you

Stop where you are
Under fading stars
This is the world we’ve made
There is no better place, it’s true
Light a fire where you are

Underneath a blanket of the cold
Lying in the dark, your seed will grow
Miracles just like a winter rose will be
Give up all the things you can’t control
Still yourself and watch them come and go
Wherever you are, you’ll find you’re home at last

Everything glitters around you
Don’t miss a day
The moon on the lake
The smell in the air when it rains
The people you can share with
The feeling you get when you’re almost there

Stop where you are
Under fading stars
This is the world we’ve made
There is no better place, it’s true
Light a fire where you are

Can’t stop the wild wind roaring
You can stop my poor heart from calling out
Light a fire where you are

Stop where you are
Under fading stars
This is the world we’ve made
There is no better place, it’s true
Light a fire where you are
