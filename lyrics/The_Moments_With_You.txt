I can't remember when it was good
Moments of happiness elude
Maybe I just misunderstood
All of the love we left behind
Watching the flash backs intertwine
Memories I will never find
So I'll love whatever you become
And forget the reckless things we've done
I think our lives have just begun
I think our lives have just begun
And I feel my world crumbling
I feel my world crumbling
I feel my soul crumbling away
And falling away, falling away with you
Staying awake to chase a dream
Tasting the air you're breathing in
I know I won't forget a thing
Promise to hold you close and pray
Watching the fantasies decay
Nothing will ever stay the same
All of the love we threw away
All of the hopes we cherished fade
Making the same mistakes again
Making the same mistakes again
I can feel my world crumbling
I can feel my life crumbling
I can feel my soul crumbling away
And falling away, falling away with you
All of the love we've left behind
Watching the flash backs intertwine
Memories I will never find
Memories I will never find
