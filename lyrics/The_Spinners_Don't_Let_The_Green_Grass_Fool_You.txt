Girl, try to remember when we didn't have no shoes
How we made it downtown to the welfare office
Just me, just you
Took a long time trying to get what we got now, baby
Don't you go away and give it up
To no other man, I couldn't understand

Don't let
Don't let the green grass fool you
Woah, no, baby, don't let
Don't let it change your mind
Yeah, yeah

It's gonna be hard trying to start our lives all over
Hey, mama, you got the kind of lovin' that I need
Oh, yeah
And if you ever leave me, ever leave me, down in the dumps without a stump to bid my heart, ooh-wee, baby
I don't think I'll live to see a brand-new day
I wanna hear you do it to me, say

Don't, don't
Don't let the green grass fool you
No, baby, don't let it, don't let it change your mind
Oh, it might be greener way over there somewhere (Greener on the other side, yeah)
Woah, I'm here, girl, and these big black arms of mine is where you belong (Where you belong)
Oh, I'm just gonna let these fellas play a little

Oh-woah-woah-woah, don't let the green grass fool you, baby
Don't you never ever, never ever, never, never let it change your mind
Ooh, think of me, just look at me (Don't let the green grass fool you)
When the world's turned a shoulder
I'll be here, baby, yeah (Don't let it)
And right here, girl, is where you belong (Change your mind)

You know,  a couple days that, uh
You done met Freddy who's got a Cadillac
And you know I always drive a Nash
But baby, he can talk sweet nothings in your ear, woman
I got action, girl, you know I got cash

And I'm saying, baby, don't, don't, don't (Greener on the other side, yeah)
Don't let the green grass fool you
Bubbling over inside me when I tell you, baby
Don't let it change your mind (Where you belong)
Woah, I can sit here all day
Just wasting time away
Thinking about you
Needing you
Just telling you, baby
That right here's girl is where you belong
Come on, give it to me
Oh-oh-woah-woah (Don't, don't, don't)
Woah, yeah (Don't let the green grass fool you)
Woah, yeah (Don't, don't, don't)
Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay (Don't let it change your mind)
Don't, don't (Greener)
