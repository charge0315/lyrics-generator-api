We could be anywhere tonight
But we're right here underneath the lights
I see the colors in your eyes
Beautiful rainbows all around us
We got the whole world in our hands (Mr. Worldwide)
This is the night we won't forget (Chris Brown)
Whatever happens in the end, I just hope (Hope)
I hope we meet again

La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
I just hope, I hope we meet again (Woo!)
(To those lost, but never forgotten)

Papo, I told ya (I told ya, haha), they'll be comin' back one day (One day)
Throw this song to the world and watch 'em catch it like a bouquet (Catch that)
Australia, the UK, jump the puddle straight to the States
It's okay, let 'em hate, 'cause they'll be comin' back one day, dalé (Woo!)

Now the world is my backyard (Backyard) and I would like to thank y'all (Thank y'all)
'Cause I was at a point (Point), point blank, that I would point blank, y'all (Y'all)
I found myself (Myself), in turn, I lost my mind (My mind)
Sometimes I feel like an old school marimbero lost in time (Haha)
They say to be wise (To be wise), is to know what you don't know (Don't know)
And I don't know shit, does that make me wise? Papo, I don't know (I don't know)
But this much I can say (Yeah), to my best friend Eddie
My father, Guarilla, Abuelo Rudy, and to my brother Drama
I'll be back for y'all one day (Woo!)
