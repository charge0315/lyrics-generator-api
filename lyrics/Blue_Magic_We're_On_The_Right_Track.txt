We're on the right track, we're on the right track now
Both you and I
Have said things that we learned to regret
You know love is the way
When we want to forgive and forget
Now we've found the right direction, girl
We found love and affection
Loving is my selection
So stay under my protection
We're on the right track, we're on the right track now
I'm so glad that
We're on the right track, we're on the right track now
Your symphony
Makes me feel I can dance to your song
You know you proved to me
That this love that we have is so strong
We could be a legend in our time
We make up on rhyme
We could go down in history
The greatest love of all time
'Cause
We're on the right track, we're on the right track now
Hey
We're on the right track, we're on the right track now
We could be a legend in our time
We make up on rhyme
We could go down in history
The greatest love of all time
'Cause
We're on the right track, we're on the right track now
I'm so glad that
We're on the right track, we're on the right track now
You and me, together we'll be on the right track now (We're on the right track, we're on the right track now)
I'm so glad that
