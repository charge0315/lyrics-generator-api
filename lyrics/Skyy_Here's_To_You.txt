Here's to you
Just for you
Here's to you
This song's for you
You're so special
There's no one else like you
Your style, your smile, your personality
Like a dream come true
You give me love like no other
So unselfishly
So I'm singing this song
Let the whole world know
Keep on doing what you do
What you do
*Repeat
Feels like I'm sitting on top of the world
Whenever you're around me
Pick me up when I'm down
Thank you boy, thank you boy
And when we touch
Can't get enough
The feeling's oh so right
Whatever ...your mind
What you do what you do
*Repeat with adlibs
**I wanna thank you baby
Thank thank you baby
Thank you thank you
**Repeat (x2)
Yeah yeah yeah
Just wanna let you know
So I'm singing this song
Let the whole world know
Keep on doing what you do
What you do
*Repeat with adlibs
