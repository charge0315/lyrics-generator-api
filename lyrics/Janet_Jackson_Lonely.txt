Todos necesitamos
Un amigo en la soledad
Ha-ah, hey

Feeling so alone and deserted
With people standing all around you
Should I trust someone?
Should I stay off to myself?
Alone with no one to talk to
It's such a helpless feeling
So any time you feel the need
Call me when you're lonely
'Cause everybody needs a friend
To be there when you're lonely
Wait a minute, mi amor

So don't isolate yourself every time that I come around, yeah
A person all alone is an unhappy one
We need somebody near to love us
Someone who cares (Someone who cares)
Living life all by yourselve's impossible to do
And I'll be there for you

Anytime you feel the need
Call me when you're lonely
'Cause everybody needs a friend
And I'll be yours, if you're lonely
Hey (If you're all alone)

If you're all alone and a friend you need (Need)
Like a river flows you hurt, I'll bleed (You hurt, I'll bleed)
If you trust in me, we can find a way (We can find a way)
Take away the pain, time heals all things time (Time heals all things)
Even a lonely state of mind
'Cause happiness is, oh, so hard to find (Oh, so hard to find)
Ooh-hoo
Ooh
Tú siempre puedes contar conmigo
If you're lonely, I will be there
Tú siempre puedes contar conmigo
When you call for me, be there for you

So anytime you feel the need (I will be there for you)
Call me when you're lonely (Be there with you, baby)
Any time you need me, call me (Call me, call me, call me)
'Cause everybody needs a friend (Everybody needs a friend)
To be there when you're lonely, ooh (To be there when they feel lonely)
No, tonight, call on me, baby (Call me, call me)
When you need a friend (When you need a friend)
You can call on me (You can call on me, yeah)
Never let you down, never let you down (Never let you down, never let you down, yeah, yeah)
Yeah, yeah
No tengas marido

So anytime you feel the need (Hold you tight)
Call me when you're lonely (Be there for you, always through the night, mhmm, no, no, oh)
If you're all alone and a friend in need
I'll be there for you, be there for you
Oh, baby, oh, baby
If you're all alone and a friend you need
Like a river flows you hurt, I'll bleed
If you trust in me, we can find a way
Take away the pain, time heals all things
Even a lonely state of mind
'Cause happiness is, oh, so hard to find

Una persona solitaria es una persona muy triste
Te quiero tanto
