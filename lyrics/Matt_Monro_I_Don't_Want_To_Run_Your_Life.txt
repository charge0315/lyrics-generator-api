(Verse 1)
I've felt the closing walls
Trouble on the rise
You didn't have to say a word
I saw it in your eyes
(Verse 2)
I was losing you, and you were leaving me
I looked into your eyes and saw the things
I couldn't see
(Verse 3)
You needed room to breathe
You have your life too
I was thinking of myself and not enough for you
(Verse 4)
No, I don't want to run your life, I just wanna share your space
I just want to be the one who puts a smile upon your face
No I don't want to hold you back, I don't wanna tie you down
I'll nevеr stand in your way again, but i'll always be around!
(Verse 5)
Somеtimes, we can't see, the pride before the fall
It's better late than never mean't to never see at all
I'm strong enough to change, The selfishness in me!
I let love find an open mind, where we can both be free
(Verse 6)
No, I don't want to run your life, I just wanna share your space
I just want to be the one who puts a smile back on your face
(Verse 7)
Sometimes, we can't see, the pride before the fall
It's better late than never mean't to never see at all
(Verse 8)
No, I don't want to run your life, I just wanna share your space
I just want to be the one who puts a smile back on your face
No, I don't want to run your life, I just wanna share your space
I just want to be the one who puts a smile back on your face
(Verse 9)
No, I don't want to run your life, I just wanna share your space
I just want to be the one who puts a smile back on your face-
(Song Ends Peacefully)
