Yeah

Lover, I'm off the street
I'm gonna go where the bright lights and the big city meet
With a red guitar, on fire
Desire

She's the candle burnin' in my room
I'm like the needle, needle and spoon
Over the counter with a shotgun
Pretty soon, everybody got one
I'm a fever when I'm beside her
Desire
Desire
(Right)
And the fever gettin' higher
Desire
Desire

Burning
Burning

She's the dollars, she's my protection
Yeah, she's the promise in the year of elections
Oh,  sister, I can't let you go
Like a preacher stealin' hearts at a travellin' show
For love of money, money, money, money, money, money
Money, money, money, money, money

And the fever gettin' higher
Desire
Desire
Desire
Desire
(Babe)

Desire
Desire
(Alright)
