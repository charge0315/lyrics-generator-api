You used to say
Love and be loved
All the time
Till you discovered
Fellings were a failure sign
When it rains
It rains so hard
The tears begin to show
When it's raining in my heart
I want the world to know
Chorus:
Life will never be the same
As it was again
Life will never be the same
As it was again
Through my anger and my joy
My tears and pain
Beneath the sea of Hollywood
Where Francis used to reign
They trade their deepest wishes
For a part in someone's game
Spirits die alone at night
For life they cannot hold
I would rather dance with you
Than have a medal to show
(chorus)
We are just everyday people
Not a theatre company
Everyone wants to join us
There's no fear in us you see
It's me for you
And you for me
Sun go east, sun go west
Will I wear a medal again
Sun go east, son go west
We can dance and bring on the rain
Now I say love for love
Not for a space in time
The strangest things
Can shatter kings
And take away what's mine
When it's raining in my heart
I want the world to know
I would rather dance with you
Than have a medal to show
(chorus)
Sun go east, sun go west
Will I wear a medal again
Sun go east, son go west
We can dance and bring on the rain
