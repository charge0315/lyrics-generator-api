Once a long, long time ago
I was looking for something new
To know and believe in
So I studied the charts
And I followed the moon
Hoping it would see me through my gloom
I was dreaming
Though in order for me to see the light
I had to learn to do things right for my living
So I gave myself a change of mind
Chorus:
Some people, they don’t understand
Because the Devil tried to make our Lord a mystery man
They criticize him and try to make you feel bad
But all I know is He’s the best friend I’ve ever had
You can’t be living
You can’t be living without the Lord
Blind no more my eyes can see
That the truth is God’s our reality from beginning
But now I hold the key to God’s door
And I’m winning
Repeat Chorus
