Sometimes a girl will come and go
You reach for love but life won't let ya know
That in the end, you'll still be lovin' her
But then she’s gone, you're all alone
I never learned to give myself
I’ve been a fool but right now I need someone else well well well
Just like boy blue I, I blow my horn
If you just lead me home, baby, I should have known
It takes a fool, to learn that love don't love nobody
It takes a fool, to learn that love don't love no one
(It takes a fool) Sometime’s you gotta suffer
(to learn that love don't love no one)
Make your bed warm gotta sleep yeah well, well
(It takes a fool to learn)
Oh yes it does that love don't love (no one) no one, no one
Sign of pain is on my face, well
My heartbeat stops but I won't take the blame, no no
I gave her all the love I had within
My love was strong, somethin' went wrong, nooo
(It takes a fool) Yes, sir (to learn)
(That love don't love nobody)
Love, love, love, love, love, love
(It takes a fool) Yes it does, girl (to learn)

The truth I’ve learned from the time I was a child
You see I know from experience that
Baby you can’t color a fault. huh
And you sure can’t touch an emotion
Love, true love is to the bone
To the soul the hearts the home and uh
