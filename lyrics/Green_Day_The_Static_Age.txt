Can you hear the sound of the static noise
Blastin' out in stereo?
Cater to the class and the paranoid
Music to my nervous system
Advertisin' love and religion
Murder on the airwaves
Slogans on the brink of corruption

Visions of blasphemy, war and peace
Oh, screamin' at you

I can't see a thing in the video
I can't hear a sound on the radio
In stereo in the static age

Billboard on the rise in the dawn's landscape
Working your insanity
Tragic à la madness and concrete
Coca-Cola execution
Conscience on a cross, and your heart's in a vise
Squeezin' out your state of mind
Are what you own that you cannot buy?

What a fuckin' tragedy, strategy
Oh, screamin' at you

I can't see a thing in the video
I can't hear a sound on the radio
In stereo in the static age
I can't see a thing in the video
I can't hear a sound on the radio
In stereo in the static age

Hey, hey, it's the static age
Well, this is how the West was won
Hey, hey, it's the static age millennium

All I wanna know is a goddamned thing
Not what's in the medicine
All I wanna do is I want to breathe
Batteries are not included
What's the latest way that a man can die
Screaming, "Hallelujah"?
Singin' out, "The dawn's early light"

Silence of the rotten, forgotten
Oh, screamin' at you

I can't see a thing in the video
I can't hear a sound on the radio
In stereo in the static age
I can't see a thing in the video
I can't hear a sound on the radio
In stereo in the static age
I can't see a thing in the video (Woah-oh)
I can't hear a sound on the radio (Woah-oh)
In stereo in the static age
I can't see a thing in the video (Woah-oh)
I can't hear a sound on the radio (Woah-oh)
In stereo in the static age

The static age
