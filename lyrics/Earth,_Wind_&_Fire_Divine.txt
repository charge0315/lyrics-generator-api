Love, divine
Your love, divine
Your love, your love is divine, your love
Your love, your love is divine, your love
You're a mystery, you're a true work of art
Like an answered prayer, like a light in the dark
Ooh, I'm in ecstasy when you're next to me
It's the closest thing to heaven I could be
Tell me everything about you
Wanna get into your mind
Gotta be forever, rain or shine
Because you're

Divine
Girl, the way you know you make my sun shine
From the shadows you can make the moon climb
Ooh, the way you're loving me is so divine
Your love, your love is divine, your love
D-I-V-I-N-E
Your love, your love is divine, your love
Just wanna tell you, baby, baby
I'm remembering how the night was so clear
You were whispering "I'm so glad that you're here"
I've always heard that love makes a man feel bliss
But I never dreamed that I could feel like this
Everything about you, baby
Got the full effect on me
Never seen a woman made so perfectly
You must be

Divine
Girl, the way you know you make my sun shine
From the shadows you can make the moon climb
Ooh, the way you're loving me
You're right on time
Divine
Something that these words could never describe
How I feel about you day and night time
Everything you do, I said, is so divine

Baby, here in my arms
Let the night linger on
'Cause the magic of love is ours tonight
Givin' strength to my life
'Cause the lovin' is right
Tell me, are you an angel, baby?
The way you make me
The way you make me feel
The way you make me
The way you, the way you make me feel
(Chorus 2)
