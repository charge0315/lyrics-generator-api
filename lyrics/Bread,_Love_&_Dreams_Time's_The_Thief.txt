Was in the bright morning of my day
I scattered my fortunes every way
In firm of purpose and unsettled mind
I crawled in the darkness, my soul was blind
I met a young girl whose brain was on fire
She said "Follow me now if your mind will not tire
I'll show you a light bulb and I'll show you the sun
I'll show you a rainbow where the colours have run"
And if you could see the colours
That go flashing through my mind
I have quite sensational senses
For one so colourblind
Take my eyes and you will see
Your painted priestess differently
I'm not to blame, my mind is lame
It's only a game
I'm not to blame, my mind is lame
It's only a game
She took me for hers, though I was but a child
Her hair, it was free and my thoughts, they grew wild
She gave me the hills and she gave me the sea
But she kept her soul and she took mine from me
But as days went on, I learned to be free
I learned to take as she took from me
Take the sting from your tongue and taste the sweet food
The way I may want to and my taste is good
With your sweeping hand of judgement
You have pushed aside mankind
And you corroded pearls of wisdom
They did castigate my mind
But sleeping fools like me and mine
Have never drunk from your sparkling wine
We're not to blame, our minds are lame
It's only a game
We're not to blame, our minds are lame
It's only a game
I left her one morning as she lay asleep
From London and stillness and sadness did creep
With new thoughts of freedom, I'm on my way home
Left her with her problems, went to solve my own
Now often as darkness turns towards day
And the fingers of sleep begin pointing my way
I might think of that girl as I turn towards bed
But no pain do I feel, no tears do I shed
And I was thinking that our springtime love
Was as eternal as the river
But a time must come when eyelids
Must be gently closed forever
And the still grey hand of sorrow
Points the way towards tomorrow
And I bid you good day
I'm on my way, I've nothing to say
So I bid you good day
I'm on my way, I've nothing to say
So I bid you good day
I'm on my way, I've nothing to say
I bid you good day
I bid you good day
I bid you good day
I bid you good day
I bid you good day
