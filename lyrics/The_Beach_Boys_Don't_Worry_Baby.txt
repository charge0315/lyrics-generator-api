Well, it's been building up inside of me
For, oh, I don't know how long
I don't know why, but I keep thinking
Something's bound to go wrong
But she looks in my eyes
And makes me realize

When she says, "Don't worry, baby"
Don't worry, baby (Don't worry, baby)
Everything will turn out all right (Don't worry, baby)
Don't worry, baby (Don't worry, baby)
Ooh

I guess I should've kept my mouth shut
When I started to brag about my car
But I can't back down now because
I pushed the other guys too far
She makes me come alive
And makes me wanna drive

When she says, "Don't worry, baby"
Don't worry, baby (Don't worry, baby)
Everything will turn out all right (Don't worry, baby)
Don't worry, baby (Don't worry, baby)
Ooh

She told me, "Baby, when you race today
Just take along my love with you
And if you knew how much I loved you, baby
Nothing could go wrong with you"
Oh, what she does to me
When she makes love to me

And she says, "Don't worry, baby"
Don't worry, baby (Don't worry, baby)
Everything will turn out all right (Don't worry, baby)
Don't worry, baby (Don't worry baby)
Everything will turn out all right (Don't worry, baby)
Don't worry baby (Don't worry, baby)
Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
