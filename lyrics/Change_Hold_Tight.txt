Hold tight

Hold tight
If you wanna make this feelin' stay
Hold tight, hold tight
Don't let this moment fade away
Hold tight
Now it's here, it's gonna stay

Everybody gets the chance someday
Call it once, at last
You think you've got it made
Not a word that anyone can say
That can change the way you feel
'Cause you know that love is real
You can choose with whom you fall in love
Anybody, any moment, anywhere
'Cause no matter who you chose
There's a chance that you might lose
Gonna try and that's the best that I can do

Hold tight
If you wanna make this feeling stay
Hold tight, hold tight
Don't let this moment fade away
Hold tight
Now it's here, it's gonna stay
Hold tight
If you wanna make this feeling stay
Hold tight, hold tight
Don't let this moment fade away
Hold tight
Now it's here, it's gonna stay

You can do just anything you want
You can help yourself to anything that's mine
Take it easy when there's no one else
Got to get it right this time
Gonna try to make love shine
Everybody gets the chance someday
You just take it when the moment comes along
There's nothing you can say
There's nothing you can do
When you find the eyes of love are set on you

Hold tight
If you wanna make this feeling stay
Hold tight, hold tight
Don't let this moment fade away
Hold tight
Now it's here, it's gonna stay

Now's the moment of a lifetime
And it's here for you
Come on babe, it's time to
Make a place now everybody
Got to let us through
Got a dream to catch tonight
It might come true
Hold tight

Hold tight
If you wanna make this feeling stay
Hold tight, hold tight
Don't let this moment fade away
Hold tight
Now it's here, it's gonna stay
Hold tight
