I got under the grip between this modern Hell
I got the rejection letter in the mail and it was already ripped to shreds
Seasons in ruin and this bitter pill is chased in blood
There's fire in my veins and it's pouring out like a flood

Woah-oh, Christian's inferno
Woah-oh, Christian's inferno
Woah-oh, Christian's inferno
Woah-oh, Christian's inferno

Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha

This diabolic state is gracing my existence
Like a catastrophic baby, baby, maybe you're the chemical reaction
I am the atom bomb, I am your chosen one
Toxin your reservoir and then return man to ape

Woah-oh, Christian's inferno
Woah-oh, Christian's inferno
Woah-oh, Christian's inferno
Woah-oh, Christian's inferno

Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha

Woah-oh, Christian's inferno
Woah-oh, Christian's inferno
Woah-oh, Christian's inferno
Woah-oh, Christian's inferno
