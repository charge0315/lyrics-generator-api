Yeah
I told you, I told you
I told you, I told you
Yeah, yea, ye-ye yeah, ye-ye yeah
1, 2, 1, 2
Come on, come on
Yo, yo, yo

I be that cat that be that cat
Shorty, tell your friends, you see that cat?
I mean um, is he that cat? He ain't all that
He got stacks and I done heard him on hot tracks
Got a gold Rollie,
And I got to wonder why a nigga think like that
So when you speak to me, you come across young and classy
I spit out fire that's why you get hired to come and crash me
Ask yourself, Card' and A+? That be flashy
They both nasty with a flavor that be jazzy
Now if it's something I like, it's different how I want it
I like it whеn you flaunt it, loving and jamming on it
They hard like the notorious rappеr, slash B.I.G
Slash Christopher, king of New York, the emperor
Slash , slash  turn delirious
Slash Cardan, slash take my shit serious

Yo it's on, son
What the deal with you
Cardan, A+ keep it live, keep it real with you
It's a must that we bust, sell a mil, a few
If you violating then we got the deal with you
Yo it's on, son
What the deal with you
Cardan, A+ keep it live, keep it real with you
It's a must that we bust, sell a mil, a few
It be the hottest shorties out, give us respect due

I know you're feeling this, the realness from the brain
I'm lyrically insane plus I can't be tamed
Since I came in the game the name been holding weight
A+ nigga, time to meet your fate
I shake like Barry, chicks blow like Mariah Carey
Think I'm a cheque, just try to cash me
I be more than gladly to smoke you, black
When me and P is on the track, shorties can lay flat
And I see that, we them cats you want to be
Push the Benz E, six double zero with the hero
I'll make it clear-o that this young, black dinero
Shining and with the timing, below zero
The threes baby, please, what's your name and number
We jet far to PR for the whole summer
And niggas know that I'm wild but
I'm hot like the new GS with the swollen eyes
Yeah I better pray to god
When Plus blow hard that you don't get hit
Feel your back split, your career ain't worth spit
Your game is mines and you can tell by the way I fold
One at a time

[Verse 3: A+ and
Cardan
]
Since I rhyme greater than the average player hater
With no navigator but some cherry alligators
It's wicked, but what if you picking, it ain't Jada
But if it is, I can tell my niggas see em later
Yo, Plus be that cat that'll lay you face flat
Hop on the jack and call shorty after that
I been around the map and still ain't happy
So you twist a nigga wig to the back like a Yankee cap
Now, lyrically I'm supposed to represent
I ain't your client, I'm just your president
Some niggas call it a , my shit is a
While I'm at it, I might as well get my bezel
We live it all up, nigga, you playing, don't want to ball up
I'm on my job son, it ain't no time to call up
Ripping the floors up from the ground to the walls up
If you 'bout it then lets see what you made of
And put your balls up
