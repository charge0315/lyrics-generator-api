Everybody's got a thing
But some don't know how to handle it
Always reaching out in vain
Just taking the things not worth having but

But don't you worry 'bout a thing
Don't you worry 'bout a thing
(Don't you worry) Baby
'Cause I'll be standing on the side
When you check it out

They say your style of life's a drag
And that you must go other places
Just don't you feel too bad
When you get fooled by smiling faces

But don't you worry 'bout a thing
Don't you worry 'bout a thing, baby
'Cause I'll be standing on the side
When you check it out

When you get off your trip
Don't you worry 'bout a thing
Don't you worry 'bout a thing

Don't you worry 'bout a thing
Don't you worry 'bout a thing
(Don't you worry)
'Cause I'll be standing on the side
When you check it out, woo

Everybody needs a change
A chance to check out the new
But you're the only one who'll see
The changes you take yourself through

But don't you worry 'bout a thing
Don't you worry 'bout a thing, sweet baby
'Cause I'll be standing in the wings
When you check it out

When you get off your trip
Don't you worry 'bout a thing
(Todo 'stá bien chévere)
(Don't you worry 'bout a thing)
Don't you worry 'bout a thing
(Todo 'stá bien chévere)
(Don't worry, baby)
Don't you worry 'bout a thing
(Don't worry, don't worry, don't worry, boy, don't worry)
(Todo 'stá bien chévere)
Don't you worry 'bout a thing
(Todo 'stá bien chévere)
('Cause I'll be right here waiting for you, baby
So don't you worry 'bout a thing)
Don't you worry 'bout a thing
(Todo 'stá bien chévere)
(Don't worry, baby, baby, oh)
Don't you worry 'bout a thing
(Todo 'stá bien chévere)
('Cause I'll be right here waiting for you, baby
I'll be right here waiting for you, boy)
Don't you worry 'bout a thing
(Todo 'stá bien chévere)
