I know we just met, but I feel like I've known you before
There's something about you, my heart has been searching for
I don't understand it, it's over my head
So don't try to solve it, just feel it instead, ooh

It isn't really such a mystery
Anyway you add it up, it turns out to be
Attraction automatic, a simple mathematic
Two to the power of love

I look in your eyes, and everything falls into place
You don't have to say it, it's written all over your face
By my calculation, I'm falling for you
It's a perfect equation, and I know that it's true, ooh

It isn't really such a mystery
Anyway you add it up, it turns out to be
Attraction automatic, a simple mathematic
Two to the power of love

It's complicated, but it's easy to see
A combination that was meant to be, ooh
It's something you can count on

It isn't really such a mystery (It isn't really such a mystery)
Anyway you add it up, it turns out to be (Anyway you add it up, it turns out to be)
Attraction automatic, a simple mathematic
Two to the power of love
It isn't really just a shot in the dark (It isn't really just a shot in the dark)
Somebody must've worked it out on the chart (Somebody must've worked it out on the chart)
Attraction automatic, a simple mathematic
Two to the power of love
It isn't really such a mystery (It isn't really such a mystery)
Anyway you add it up, it turns out to be (Anyway you add it up, it turns out to be)
Attraction automatic, a simple mathematic
Two to the power of love
