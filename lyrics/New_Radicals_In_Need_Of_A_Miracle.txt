Ooh

Looked for love in Memphis
Looked for love in Rome
Now that I finally got you
Just wanna take you home
I'm trying my best not to rush you
'Cause rushes ain't no fun
But are you breaking my love
Or looking out for a miracle?

I think it's time you tell me where we stand

You been taking my love
You been breaking my love
You better start making my love
'Cause I'm in need of a miracle
You been taking my love
You been breaking my love
You better start making my love
'Cause I'm in need of a miracle
