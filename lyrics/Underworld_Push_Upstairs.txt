Tina lives in Berlin, her voice so seldom
On my machine is here tonight
And I'm on the market
And when I'm on the market, words move faster
Wire and clouds move thin
Between us like a skin
Like a salty skin for a seed
A fat circles smiling, smiling
Her voice so intentionally smiling
And a cloud's between us
And these are my intentions

Pushin', pushin', pushin', pushin'
Pushin', pushin', pushin', push

Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah

Good blonde is carryin' somethin'
Is carryin' me and someone I used to be
A great plastic someone, blue plastic girl
Your cream is pushin', pushin'

Pushin', pushin', pushin', pushed away
Your body is, pushin', pushin', uh, pushin'

Pushed away, come before the unbelieve
Carrying some lipstick for the
The boyfriend blond between the holes of sheets
He's professionally poised, faces watching her
She's watching the faces watching her
Ah

Pushin', pushin', pushin, push
Pushin', pushin', pushin'

Love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love
Ah

Pushin', pushin', pushin', push
Pushin', pushin', pushin'

Love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
