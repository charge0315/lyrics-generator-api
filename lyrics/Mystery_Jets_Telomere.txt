Malevolence
And providence
Are opalescent
In the telomere
The forest floor
And the petrichor
The long and short
Of the telomere
Of the telomere
In your blood
The one thing they can't take away
The one thing they can't take away from you
Away from you or replace
Where the cells reside (it's in our blood)
Splinter and divide (it's in our blood)
They will never die
In the telomere
In the telomere that lives inside us
And the people walking down below
Crawling home alone like spiders
As the cancer slowly starts to grow
In your blood
The one thing they can't take away
The one thing they can't take away from you
Away but don't be afraid
Is living in our blood
The one thing they can't take away
The one thing they'll never take away from you
Away, so don't be afraid
Our telomere (is in our blood)
Our telomere (is in our blood)
Our telomere
