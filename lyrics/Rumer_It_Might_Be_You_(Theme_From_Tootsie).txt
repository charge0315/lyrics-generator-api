Time
I've been passing time watching trains go by
All of my life
Lying on the sand, watching sea birds fly
Wishing there would be
Someone waiting home for me...
Something's telling me it might be you
It's telling me it might be you
All of my life
Looking back as lovers go walking past
All of my life
Wondering how they met and what makes it last
If I found the place
Would I recognise the face?
Something's telling me it might be you
It's telling me it might be you
So many quiet walks to take
So many dreams to wake
And there's so much love to make
I think we're gonna need some time
Maybe all we need is time
And it's telling me it might be you
It's telling me it might be you
And there's so much more
No one's ever heard before
Something's telling me it might be you
It's telling me it might be you
And I'm feeling it'll just be you
All of my life
(All my life)
(All of my life)
It's you
(All my life)
(All of my life)
It's you I've been waiting for
All of my life
(All my life)
(All of my life)
It's you
(All my life)
(All of my life)
It's you I've been waiting for
All of my life
