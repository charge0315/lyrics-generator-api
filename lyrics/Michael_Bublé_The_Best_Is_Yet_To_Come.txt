Out of the tree of life, I just picked me a plum
You came along and everything started to hum
Still, it's a real good bet
The best is yet to come

The best is yet to come
And babe, won't it be fine?
You think you've seen the sun
But you ain't seen it shine

Wait 'til the warm-up's underway
Oh, wait 'til our lips have met
Wait 'til you see that sunshine day
You ain't seen nothin' yet

The best is yet to come
And babe, won't it be fine?
The best is yet to come
Come the day you're mine

The best is yet to come
Come the day you're mine
Ah, come the day that you're mine
I'm gonna teach you to fly
We've only tasted the wine
We're gonna drain that cup dry

Wait 'til your charms are right
For these arms to surround
You think you've flown before
But you ain't left the ground

Wait 'til you're locked in my embrace
Wait 'til I draw you near
Wait 'til you see that sunshine place
Ain't nothin' like it here

The best is yet to come
And babe, won't it be fine?
The best is yet to come
Come the day you're mine

Come the day you're mine
I've got plans for you, baby
And baby, you're gonna fly
