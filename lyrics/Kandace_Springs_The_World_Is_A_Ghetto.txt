Walking down the street
Smoggy-eyed
Looking at the sky
Starry-eyed
Search for the place
Weary-eyed
Crying in the night
Teary-eyed

Don't you know
That it's true
That for me
And for you
The world is a ghetto

Don't you know
That it's true
That for me
And for you
The world is a ghetto

Wonder when I'll find
Paradise
Somewhere there's a home
Sweet and nice
Wonder if I'll find
Happiness
Never give it up
Now I guess

Don't you know
That it's true
That for me
And for you
The world is a ghetto

Don't you know, yeah
That it's true
That for me
And for you
The world is a ghetto

Don't you know
That it's true
That for me
And for you
The world is a ghetto

Don't you know (don't you know)
That it's true (that it's true)
That for me (that for me)
And for you (and for you)
The world is a ghetto
The world is a ghetto

(Alright I see you, talk to me)
The world is a ghetto
The world is a ghetto, yeah
I said the world is a ghetto, baby
I'm walking down the street
Smoggy-eyed, starry-eyed, weary-eyed, teary-eyed
But the world is a ghetto
But the world is a ghetto
The world is a ghetto
