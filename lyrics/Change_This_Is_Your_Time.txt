You were way cooler when you played the piano
All hail Piano King
Back then, you had some spark
Now you’re emo and dark
Brother, do your thing
You’re killing me, bud
Gotta wake up
Wipe off the blood
You’ll be God
Go get some air out there
Karaoke is so lame to see
Really, enough’s enough
You can do so much more
Get your face off the floor
Come on, dude, get up
She’s gonna keep screaming louder
You can’t teach the past
So blast into the day, Kōsei

We’ve got your back
You’vе got to live every minutе
April’s finally here
We’ll get you on track
Just take a moment, it’s finished
It’s about time
Now it’s your time
Spring is living, colors are flowing
Kick it into gear

Out of the black
If you see fire, we’re flowing
This is your time
It’s about time
Now it’s your time
This is your time

I’m gonna open my window tonight
And if I don’t hear piano music coming from next door
I’m gonna kick your butt!
Thanks for the heads up
I’ll keep the front door locked!
You already have straight A’s
It’s not like you need to study

Don’t you have somewhere to be
Or some babes to go see
Why are both of you up in my business
Don’t be stupid, you fool
Be cool, man

You’re way more than me

There’s no looking back
You’ve got to live every minute
April’s finally here
Not looking back
To see the day and live in it
This is our time
This is your time
We’re back
You’ve got to live every minute
April’s finally here
Change up the track
We’re in the race, now we’re winning
This is our time
This is your time
This is our time
This is your time
This is our time
This is your time
Your time
