What goes on in your mind?
Don't say I'm the jealous kind
Think of all the promises we made now
You might find another girl
Living in your different world
Hoping that your memory wouldn't fade now

Whatcha gonna do when the miles are growing?
And you can't get with me
Whatcha gonna do without me knowing?
Please baby, please

Don't forget to remember
When you leave me side
I'll be thinking of you
Don't forget to remember
Every day and night
I'll be dreaming of you
(I will be thinking of you)
(I will be dreaming of you)

Got a love built to last
It's the future, not the past
Giving me these doubts inside my head now
Though I know the way I feel
Is one hundred per cent real
I wonder can you stand the test of time now

Whatcha gonna do when the smiles are flowing?
And you can't get with me
Whatcha gonna do without me knowing?
Please baby, please

Don't forget to remember
When you leave me side
I'll be thinking of you
Don't forget to remember
Every day and night
I'll be dreaming of you

I'm giving in to such a strange sensation
Missing you so tenderly (Yeah I'm missing you)
What's needed here is all your good vibrations
Please baby, please baby come back to me

Don't forget to remember
When you leave me side
I'll be thinking of you
Don't forget to remember
Every day and night
I'll be dreaming of you
Don't forget to remember
When you leave me side
I'll be thinking of you
Don't forget to remember
Every day and night
I'll be dreaming of you
Don't forget to remember
When you leave me side
I'll be thinking of you
Don't forget to remember
Every day and night
I'll be dreaming of you

I will be thinking of you
I will be dreaming of you
