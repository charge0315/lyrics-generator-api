God told Noah to make an ark
Before the great flood
God told Noah to make an ark
Before the great flood
He said gather all the fish and fowl
I must destroy what I've created now
For it is not them, but a spirit
That leads them to destruction
God told Noah to make an ark
Before the great flood
God told Noah to make an ark
Before the great flood
He said gather all the animals, fish and fowl
Before the great flood
He said gather all the animals, fish and fowl
Before the great flood
For it was the principalities of air
He could no longer stand there
And just like in those days he still lost his ways
