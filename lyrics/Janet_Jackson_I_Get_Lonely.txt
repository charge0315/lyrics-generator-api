I get so lonely
Can't let just anybody hold me
You are the one that lives in me, my dear
Want no one but you
I get so lonely
Can't let just anybody hold me
You are the one that lives in me, my dear
Want no one but

Sittin' here with my tears
All alone with my fears, I'm wondering
If I have to do without ya
But there's no reason why
Fell asleep late last night
Cryin' like a newborn child
Holdin' myself close
Pretendin' my arms are yours
I want no one but you

I get so lonely
Can't let just anybody hold me
You are the one that lives in me, my dear
Want no one but you
I get so lonely
Can't let just anybody hold me
You are the one that lives in me, my dear
Want no one but

I still remember to the day
In fact it was a third Monday
You came along to be the one for me
And now I'm alone
I'm sittin' here by the phone
Call and say that you're okay
So that I have
The chance to beg you to stay
I want no one but you

I get so lonely
Can't let just anybody hold me
You are the one that lives in me, my dear
Want no one but you
I get so lonely
Can't let just anybody hold me
You are the one that lives in me, my dear
Want no one but you
I get so lonely (Every time I see your face, baby)
Can't let just anybody hold me (Every time I hear your name)
You are the one that lives in me, my dear (Would you believe that you and me are no longer?)
I want no one but you
I get so lonely (Every time I see your face, babe)
Can't let just anybody hold me (Every time I hear your name)
You are the love that lives in me, babe (My dear)
Want no one but

Gonna break it down, break it down, break it down
Gonna break it down, break it down, break it down
You know that I know
That I get so lonely thinking of you

I get so lonely (I get lonely when I hear your name)
Can't let just anybody hold me (I get lonely when I see your face)
You are the one that lives in me, my dear
Want no one but you
I get so lonely (I get lonely when I hear your name)
Can't let just anybody hold me (I get lonely when I see your face)
You are the one that lives in me, my dear
Want no one but you (I don't want no one else but you)
I get so lonely (Every time I see your face, baby)
Can't let just anybody hold me (Every time I hear your name)
You are the one that lives in me, babe (My dear)
I want no one but you
I get so lonely (Every time I hear your name, baby)
Can't let just anybody hold me (Every time I see your face)
You are the one that lives in me, my dear (Would you believe that you and me are no longer?)
Want no one but you
