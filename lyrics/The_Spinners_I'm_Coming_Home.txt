Sitting in a railway station, my suitcase in my hand
Going back where I came from, had more than I can stand
Of watching men destroy my dreams
Picked my brain 'til it was clean
When I was up, they knocked me down
Hey, I ain't gonna hang around

I'm going home, hey, yes I am (Coming home)
Won't you understand?
Why don't you tell someone to meet me?
I'm coming home
(Tell someone to meet me)
Why don't you?
Yes, sirree
Ooh, let me tell y'all

Came to this old town seeking fortune and some fame
I never got the chance to prove myself, though I tried to play their game
Using people just ain't my thing
I won't dangle from any string
To please some fool that don't care about
They turned me inside out

I'm going home, yeah
Had to find, you know
I got it, you know too
Hey, I know what I'm gonna do
I'm gonna tell someone to meet me
Home, yes I am
Look here
(Tell someone to meet me)
When you're down and out, hey, hey

I gotta admit it
I'm really not ashamed of half the things I said
And I don't want nobody trying to show me pity
'Cause I've had more than I can stand
And back home, I'll be a better man
I can rearrange my life
Might even find me a pretty wife
Hey, hey, hey (Home)

Won't you wait for me?
Start to get moving (Going home)
Lord, have mercy on me (Going home)
Try to be, try to be a good man
But I gotta get myself together, I'm going home (Tell someone to meet me, I'm going home)
Yes, I am
Hey, hey, hey
(Tell someone to meet me)
Why don't you? Why don't you? Why don't you?
(Tell someone to meet me)
Why don't you?
(Tell someone to meet me)
Oh, hey

It was gonna get steady, then I came to the city
Living in a cold, black place full of that— Hey
You know I gotta get there
Ain't used to living like that, see
It's been a long time
Since I felt like a real man
Coming to the city
Hey, you have the wrong thing
Have my things on my back, I'm going back where I came from
Yeah, 'cause don't nobody really care about you
Ain't having no fun
