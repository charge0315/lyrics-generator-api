Sometimes I tell myself I'm leaving
And I'd like to think I could really go
But it's just my pride that I'm deceiving
'Cause deep inside I really know
After you
Who could there be
After you
What's left for me
I'd be lost if you'd ever go
I'd just be broken in two
'Cause who could there be
After you
Before you I was always running
My heart was always chasing someone new
But I could feel a change was comin'
When my heart kept on chasin', racin'
After you
Who could there be
After you
What's left for me
I'd be lost if you'd ever go
I'd just be broken in two
'Cause who could there be
After you
If I thought someone could take your place
I'd just be kiddin' myself
'Cause I know I'd have to be a fool
To think that I could feel this way
For someone else, for someone else 'cause
After you
Who could there be
After you
What's left for me
I'd be lost if you'd ever go
I'd just be broken in two
'Cause who could there be
After you
Tell me who could there be
After you
