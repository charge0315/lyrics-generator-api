As I was walkin' by, saw you standin' there with a smile
Lookin' shy you caught my eye
Thought you'd want to hang for a while
Well, I'd like to be with you
And you know it's Friday, too
I hope you can find the time this weekend
To relax and unwind

My mind's tired, I've worked so hard all week (Ooh, all week)
I cashed my check, I'm ready to go
I promise you, I'll show you such a good time

Come on, baby, let's get away
Let's save our troubles for another day
Come go with me, we've got it made
Let me take you on an escapade
Let's go

(
Escapade
) We'll have a good time
(
Escapade
) Leave your worries behind
(
Escapade
) Well, you can be mine
(
Escapade
) An escapade

So don't hold back, just have a good time, yeah, yeah
We'll make the rules up as we go along
And break them all if we're not havin' fun

Come on, baby, let's get away (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Let's save our troubles for another day (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Come go with me, we've got it made (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Let me take you on an escapade (On an escapade, baby)
Come on, baby, let's get away (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Let's save our troubles for another day (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Come go with me, we've got it made (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Let me take you on an escapade
Let's go

Minneapolis!
Come on, now!
