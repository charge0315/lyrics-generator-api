Stop and get ahold of yourself, things aren't that bad
I know it’s true that he took your love, and he made you sad
Once you find out just who you are
Searching for your dreams, they're not far, so
Open up
And free your mind
Only then will you find
A real love here to bring you happiness
Why do you keep telling yourself, that love is not here
It depends on who you're loving, and make it for real
On my side is where you should be
Look my way and I’ll make you see, just
Open up
And free your mind
Only then will you find
A real love here to bring you happiness
Oh, stop and get ahold of yourself
Check love out, it's alright, mmh
Stop and get ahold of yourself
Make a move, if you choose
And find a real love to bring you happiness
Once you find out just who you are
Searching for your dreams, they're not far, so
Open up
And free your mind
Only then will you find
A real love here to bring you happiness
Oh, stop and get ahold of yourself (Well)
Check love out, it's alright (Say it again, now now now)
Stop and get ahold of yourself (Well, well)
Make a move, if you choose (Say it again, ah ah ah)
I said, stop and get ahold of yourself (Well, well)
Check love out, it's alright (Check it out, it's alright now)
Stop and get ahold of yourself (Well, well)
Make a move, if you choose (Let's go now)
Oh, stop and get ahold of yourself (Well)
Check love out, it's alright (Say it again, say it again)
Stop and get ahold of yourself (Well)
Make a move, if you choose (Make a move, say it again)
I said, stop and get ahold of yourself
Check love out, it’s alright
Stop and get ahold of yourself
Make a move, if you choose (Say it again, say it again)
