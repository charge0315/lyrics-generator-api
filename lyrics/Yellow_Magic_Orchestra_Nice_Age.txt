Her toys are broken boys
Lined heart to heart at her door
Each a burnt-out kiss on her lips
A measure of her pleasure

She's at a nice age
Ripe age
Ready to be killed by the thrill
She's at a nice age
Ripe age
Ready to be killed by the thrill

The child in her smile is cracked
Her innocence smashed
There's nothing left of her party dress
The bow in her hair isn't there

She's at a nice age
Ripe age
Ready to be killed by the thrill
She's at a nice age
Ripe age
Ready to be killed by the thrill

１週間たってしまったんですけれども
でももうそこにはいられなくなって
彼は花のように姿をあらわします
She's coming up like a flower

Through the prisons of perfume
Alone with her cheekbones
Counting lovers she has known
In the secrets of her room

Her toys are broken boys
Lined heart to heart at the door
Each a burnt-out kiss on her lips
A measure of her pleasure

She's at a nice age
Ripe age
Ready to be killed by the thrill
She's at a nice age
Ripe age
Ready to be killed by the thrill

She's at a nice age, ripe age (The taste of first lipstick)
Ready to be killed by the thrill (The mechanics of a wink)
She's at a nice age, ripe age (The china of the doll)
Ready to be killed by the thrill (Divine on her chaise lounge)
She's at a nice age...
