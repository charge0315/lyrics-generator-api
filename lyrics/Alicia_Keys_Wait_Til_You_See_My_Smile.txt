When the wind is blowin' in your face
Sometimes in life, you don't see straight
Pray to him, he will show
When your head is in a certain place
Nobody around to make you say
Stand strong and you will grow

Oooh, wait 'til you see my smile
Oooh, wait 'til they see your smile

Don't they love to see you down?
Kick you while you're on the ground
Don't let emotions show
People always speculate
Don't let it get in your way
They say things they don't know

Oooh, wait 'til you see my smile
Oooh, wait 'til they see your smile

Hey
So you're doing better now
Everybody comes around
But you don't really need 'em much
'Cause you're stronger and you're better
And you're ready for whatever, sing

Oooh, wait 'til you see my smile
Oooh, wait 'til they see your smile
Oooh, wait 'til you see my smile
Oooh, wait 'til they see your smile
