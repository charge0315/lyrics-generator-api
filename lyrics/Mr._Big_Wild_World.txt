La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la, la-la

Now that I've lost everything to you
You say you wanna start something new
And it's breaking my heart you're leavin'
Baby, I'm grieving

But if you wanna leave, take good care
Hope you have a lot of nice things to wear
But then, a lot of nice things turn bad out there

Ooh, baby, baby, it's a wild world
It's hard to get by just upon a smile
Ooh, baby, baby, it's a wild world
I'll always remember you like a child, girl

You know, I've seen a lot of what the world can do
And it's breakin' my heart in two
'Cause I never wanna see you sad, girl
Don't be a bad girl

But if you wanna leave, take good care
Hope you make a lot of nice friends out there
Just remember there's a lot of bad and beware

Ooh, baby, baby, it's a wild world
It's hard to get by just upon a smile
Ooh, baby, baby, it's a wild world
And I'll always remember you like a child, girl
Yeah

La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la, la-la
Baby, I love you

But if you wanna leave, take good care
Hope you make a lot of nice friends out there
But just remember there's a lot of bad and beware

Ooh, baby, baby, it's a wild world
It's hard to get by just upon a smile
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Ooh, baby, baby, it's a wild world
And I'll always remember you like a child, girl, oh yeah
Ooh, baby, baby, it's a wild world
It's hard to get by just upon a smile
Yeah, yeah
Ooh, baby, baby, it's a wild world
And I'll always remember you like a child, girl
