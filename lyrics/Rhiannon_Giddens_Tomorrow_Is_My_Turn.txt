Those who may reach for the stars
Others will end behind bars
What the future has in store, no one never knows before

Though time may help you forget
All that has happened before
It's too late to regret, what is gone will be no more

Tomorrow is my turn, no more doubts, no more fears
Tomorrow is my turn, when my luck is returning
All these years I've been learning to save fingers from burning
Tomorrow is my turn, no more doubts, no more fears
Tomorrow is my turn to receive without giving
To make life worth a living, for it's my life I'm living
And my only concern, that tomorrow is my turn

When summer is gone
There's another to come
You can't stop years drifting by
Even if you want to try

Though time may help you forget
All that has happened before
It's too late to regret, what is gone will be no more

Tomorrow is my turn, no more doubts, no more fears
Tomorrow is my turn, when my luck is returning
All these years I've been learning to save fingers from burning
Tomorrow is my turn, no more doubts, no more fears
Tomorrow is my turn to receive without giving
To make life worth a living, for it's my life I'm living
And my only concern, that tomorrow is my turn
Tomorrow is my turn, no more doubts, no more fears
Tomorrow is my turn, when my luck is returning
All these years I've been learning to save fingers from burning
Tomorrow is my turn, no more doubts, no more fears
Tomorrow is my turn to receive without giving
To make life worth a living, for it's my life I'm living
And my only concern, that tomorrow is my turn
