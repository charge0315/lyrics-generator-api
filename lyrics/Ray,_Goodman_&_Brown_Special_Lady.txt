You must be a special lady
(Billy, you singin' first tenor or second?
Nah, Harry, I'm singin' second, man)
And a very exciting girl
(Al, bring that bass out, man
Hey man, I'll bring it out a little bit more)
You gotta be a special lady
(Let's get down on some harmony, come on)
'Cause you got me sittin' on top of the world
Sittin' on top of the world

Somehow I knew it would be you
To change my gray skies to blue
And it was strange when you called my name
Ever since that day I haven't been the same, ooh

Before I met you, my sun didn't want to shine
Then all of a sudden you snuck up from behind
Pop (Pop) went the reason in my mind

You must be a sweet special lady
And a very exciting girl (Ooh, so exciting)
You gotta be a special lady (What a lady)
'Cause you got me sittin' on top of the world
Sittin' on top of the world

I was like a song so out of key
Then you came and gave my soul a melody
Thanks to you, for pullin' me through
I've always lost but now I win with you

Before I met you, my sun didn't want to shine
Then all of a sudden you snuck up from behind
Pop (Pop) went the reason in my mind

You must be a special lady (I got a lady)
And a very exciting girl (So exciting, woo)
You gotta be a special lady (What a lady)
'Cause you got me sittin' on top of the world (Oh)
Sittin' on top of the world

Ooh, what a lady
Oh
Sittin' on top of the world
Sittin' on top of the world

Before I met you, my sun didn't want to shine
Then all of a sudden you snuck up from behind
Pop (Pop) went the reason in my mind

You must be a special lady (What a lady)
And a very exciting girl (So exciting)
You gotta be a special lady
'Cause you got me sittin' on top of the world (Ooh)
Sittin' on top of the world

You must be a special lady (What a lady)
And a very exciting girl (Mmm, what a lady)
You gotta be a special lady
(Get down, Billy Brown) (Alright, Harry Ray)
'Cause you got me sittin' on top of the world
Sittin' on top of the world
You must be a special lady (Woo)
And a very exciting girl (Oh, girl, oh, girl)
You gotta be a special lady
'Cause you got me sittin' on top of the world
