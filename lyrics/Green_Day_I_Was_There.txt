Looking back upon my life and the places that I've been
Pictures, faces, girls I've loved, I try to remember when
Faded memories on the wall, some names I have forgotten
But each one is a memory I look back on so often

I look into the past and I want to make it last
I was there, I was there
I look into the past and I want to make it last
I was there, I was there

Looking back what I have done, there's lots more life to live
At times I feel overwhelmed, I question what I can give
But I don't let it get me down or cause me too much sorrow
There's no doubt about who I am, I always have tomorrow

I look into the past and I want to make it last
I was there, I was there
I look into the past and I want to make it last
I was there, I was there

Looking back upon my life (On my life)
Faded memories on my wall (On the wall)
Looking now at who I am (Who am I?)
I don't let it get me down (Oh I don't let it get me down)

Looking back upon my life and the places that I've been
Pictures, faces, girls I've loved, I try to remember when
But I don't let it get me down or cause me too much sorrow
There's no doubt about who I am, I always have tomorrow

I look into the past and I want to make it last
I was there, I was there
I look into the past and I want to make it last
I was there, I was there
