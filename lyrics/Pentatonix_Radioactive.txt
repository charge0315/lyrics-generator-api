I'm wakin' up, to ash and dust
I wipe my brow and I sweat my rust
I'm breathing in, the chemicals
I'm breaking in, I'm shaping up
Then checking out, of the prison bus
This is it, the apocalypse
Whoa-oh
I'm waking up
I feel it in my bones
To make my system go
Welcome to the new age, to the new age
Welcome to the new age, to the new age
Whoa-oh-oh-oh oh, Whoa-oh-oh-oh I'm radioactive, radioactive
Whoa-oh-oh-oh oh, Whoa-oh-oh-oh I'm radioactive, radioactive
I'm breaking in, shaping up
Checking out, of the prison bus
This is it, the apocalypse, whoa-oh
I'm waking up
I feel it in my bones
To make my system go
Welcome to the new age, to the new age
Welcome to the new age, to the new age
Whoa-oh-oh-oh oh, Whoa-oh-oh-oh I'm radioactive, radioactive
Whoa-oh-oh-oh oh, Whoa-oh-oh-oh I'm radioactive, radioactive
All systems go, sign hasn't died
Deep in my bones, straight from inside
I'm waking up, (Welcome to the new age, to the new age)
(Welcome to the new age)
I'm waking up
I feel it in my bones
To make my system go
Welcome to the new age, to the new age
Welcome to the new age, to the new age
Whoa-oh-oh-oh oh, Whoa-oh-oh-oh I'm radioactive, radioactive
Whoa-oh-oh-oh oh, Whoa-oh-oh-oh I'm radioactive, radioactive
