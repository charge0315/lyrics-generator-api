All night and day, just chippin' away
It's all in a day's work
Tryin' hard to defend the time that I spend
Alone
The ground that you lose exploiting the blues
Won't get the job done
As hard as it bites, I'm keepin' my sights
On you

What ya gonna do for me
What ya gonna do for me
What ya gonna do for me
When the chips are down?

In the cool of the night, when nothing seems right
The feeling can take you
Strange as it seems, you make your own dreams
Come true
If you try to conceal the way that you feel
Then you're asking for trouble
Just as sure as I cry, I'm keeping my eye
On you, yeah

What ya gonna do for me (When the going gets tough, boy)
What ya gonna do for me (Tell me truly)
What ya gonna do for me
When the chips are down?
What ya gonna do for me (Mm-mm)
What ya gonna do for me (What ya gonna do for me?)
What ya gonna do for me
When the chips are down

You don't have to tell me
I'm to blame for all this
'Cause what you hold against me
Is what I miss

What ya gonna do for me (What ya gonna do, boy?)
What ya gonna do for me (What's on your mind?)
What ya gonna do for me (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
What ya gonna do for me, boy?
What ya gonna do for me (What ya gonna do, what ya gonna do, boy)
What ya gonna do for me (Oh-oh)
What ya gonna do for me
What?
What ya gonna do, boy? What ya gonna do, boy?
What ya gonna do, boy?
