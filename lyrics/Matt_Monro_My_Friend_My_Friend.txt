My friend, my friend, if you could only see me
I'm lost amid the music and the wine
I only know I love you although the memory of you
Is all I have to warm this heart of mine
My tender friend I cry for all I owe you
My tears will never wash away the debt
Too late say forgive and every day I live
Will fill my cup with bittersweet regret
The dawn will soon be here, the sun will kiss the sky
But will the pain have ended then
And still I can't believe it, I never will believe it
Your lips and mine will never meet again
My friend, my sweet forsaken love, forgive me
I never knew how bitter life would be
And if you could have known how sad I'd be alone
You'd reach across the stars and cry for me
And if you could have known how sad I'd be alone
You'd reach across the stars and cry for me...
