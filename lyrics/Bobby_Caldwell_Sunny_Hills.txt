The family's agreed
We know what you need, is a quiet place
We have labored to find a place
Where your mind can dwell
Where you can while away
The hours that fill each day
You won't remember the life you once knew
This is your home
You won't feel alone with the people here
And with each day that's spent
You'll grow more content with the atmosphere
There's nothing more to tell
We wish you a fond farewell
Maybe you'll find someone you can talk to

Here at Sunny Hills
You will see people live and die
But how pleasant life can be

Shuffleboard at noon
And you're gonna make some friends here
And you'll find out soon
Your life here may seem a bit too extreme
And may be unfair but you soon will forget
As you watch the sunset from your easy chair
Sometimes the mind can change
But here they won't think you're strange
You won't remember the life you once knew

Here at Sunny Hills
You will see people live and die
But how pleasant life can be

Here at Sunny Hills
You will see people live and die
But how pleasant life can be
