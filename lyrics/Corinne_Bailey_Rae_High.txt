I know you’re probably expecting some poetic words
About love and the sun and the Universe
But I don’t need to explain
I don’t have to describe this
I hardly mention your name when I’m out with my friends
While they go over and over their dates again
They can see in my eyes
They can tell by my smile
Cause when I met you I was frozen
Nothing left my heart was broken
You came along
Just like the perfect song
My darling you
You make me do everything differently
Your love is taking me high as the moon
Don’t want to move
‘cause I don’t want to break the spell
Now that you’re mine
I’m staying quiet
‘cause my words are useless
They only confuse us
So why even try
When it’s so right
And I don’t want to break the spell
I know they probably want me to open the door
And tell it all to the world like I’ve done before
But it’s the things that you do
When there’s nobody watching
Shall we turn off our phones
Shall we close all the curtains
‘cause I don’t really feel like going out tonight?
Can't we hide from the world
All alone it’s so perfect
‘cause when I met you I was broken
Nothing left my heart was opened
You came along and brightened up my world
My darling you
You make me do everything differently
Your love is taking me high as the moon
Don’t want to move
‘cause I don’t want to break the spell
Now that you’re mine
I’m staying quiet
‘cause my words are useless
They only confuse us
So why even try
When it’s so right
And I don’t want to break the spell
Now I’m in a daze
Lost in time a space
And this can’t be replaced
I don’t want to break it
This is something new
A beautiful cocoon
That we’ve come into
My darling you
You make me do everything differently
Your love is taking me high as the moon
Don’t want to move
‘cause I don’t want to break the spell
Now that you’re mine
I’m staying quiet
‘cause my words are useless
They only confuse us
So why even try
When it’s so right
And I don’t want to break the spell
