Can't resist, full of lies
Full of it and fully deny
Couldn't risk but
Couldn't decided anyway
I admit I would deceive
You are hit with this disease
Another fact I just can't conceive
And the truest most pure of hearts
And the truest most pure is not
Immune to blue
I admit I confess
Evil without rest
And you'd be true at any test
So wise up
What was thrown down to you
Could be a crown on me
We can speak here openly
And the truest most pure of hearts
And the truest most pure is not
Immune to blue
So soon
We'll all be immune
