So sweet, got me looking up, got me looking up to you
So sweet, got me looking up to you
So sweet, got me looking up, got me looking up to you

First impressions, had me guessing how it could be
Often thinking that you could be the love I need
I'm looking forward to that sweet reality, oh yeah
I see myself rewarded with the love I need

And what I'm believing got me looking up to you
What I'm receiving keeps me feeling like I do, oh yeah

There's a thing never simplified, oh no
Only mastered by those who take the time
Don't you know good judgment could keep it on your side
The rules are buried, emotions often decide

What I'm believing got me looking up to you
What I'm receiving keeps me feeling like I do, oh yeah

And so sweet, got me lookin' up, got me lookin' up to you
So sweet, baby, got me lookin' up to you
So sweet, got me lookin' up, got me lookin' up to you (So sweet)
Got me lookin' up to you

You know these times can take you through so many changes — yes, they can
Things you can't figure out sometimes seem the strangest, mhm
People doing things no one can explain
I don't know what I would do if love wasn't here to keep me sane, whoa-oh-oh

What I'm believing's got me looking up to you, baby girl, I...
What I'm receiving keeps me feeling like I do

And so sweet, it's so sweet, baby
Got me looking, got me looking up to you
Wanna say, wanna say, wanna say

(What I'm believing) What I'm believing
(Got me looking up to you) Got me looking up to you
(What I'm receiving) What I'm receiving
(Keeps me feeling like I do) Keeps me feeling like I do

What I'm believing got me looking up to you
What I'm receiving keeps me feeling I do
What I'm believing (What I'm believ—) got me looking up to you
(Yeah, what I'm believing, baby)
What I'm receiving (What I'm receiving) keeps me feeling I do
(Keeps me feeling like I do, baby, yeah)
What I'm believing (What I'm believing, mama)
Got me looking up to you (What I'm believing, baby)
