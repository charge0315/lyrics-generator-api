You walk into the world you make
You lose yourself but you, you find your way
I'm going to watch you

Radiate, radiate
Radiate, radiate

We turn so slow, I know it's hard to wait
Take your time, sun is yours to take
I'm going to watch you

Radiate, radiate
Radiate, oh-oh, radiate

Well these rocks, they hold heat
Pools of water cool your feet
As you walk, you believe
Every part of the dream

I see you lost in what you create
All of time in this one single day
You take it in and you

Radiate, radiate
Radiate, oh-oh, radiate

Follow your hands as they build, as they shape
As they follow your mind and rose like a wave
Take it and you

Radiate, radiate
I'm going to watch you radiate, oh-oh, radiate

Well these rocks, they hold heat
Pools of water cool your feet
As you walk, you believe
Every part of the dream
