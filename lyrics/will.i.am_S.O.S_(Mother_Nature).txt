Lord, come down and help us out
Send us an angel, help us out
S.O.S., help us out
Lookin' all around and a-watchin' the world

People killin', people dyin', people lyin', people blind
People don't see the sign, watchin' money all the time
Get the pennies, get the dimes, get the dollars is the mind
State of the human race, people on the paper chase
The environment is fragile and we been on a gradual
Decline and in our lifetime we'll lose the battle
Get burned by volcanos, get blown by tornados
'Cause Mother Nature's signals is tryin' to warn NATO
We got a new terror threat, it's called the weather
More deadlier than chemical and nuclear together
It's hotter in the winter, even hotter in the summer
Jesus or Buddha, somebody come and help us out

Lord, come down and help us out
Send us an angel, help us out
S.O.S., help us out
Lookin' all around and a-watchin' the world
Changing
Open up your eyes, you can see things rearranging
The world is dying
And if they say it's gon' be alright, then people are lying

People trapped behind the gates, ignorance is a state
Of mind 'cause they formulate a plan just to penetrate us
You see, they stimulate us with fear manipulators
Each year they dominate, dividin' us like calculators
And we can't add it up 'cause calculators do the math for us
And here they come, choppin' down the, choppin' down the rainforest
Fuckin' up our air for us, they don't really care for us
And we can't complain because the only one to blame is us
The gas is risin' up but we keep on fillin' up
CO2 levels got the whole planet heated up
It's blazin' in the winter, even hotter in the summer
Muhammad, Jehovah, somebody come and help us out

Lord, come down and help us out
Send us an angel, help us out
S.O.S., help us out
Looks like we ain't gon' figure it out
Lord, come down and help us out
Send us an angel, help us out
S.O.S., help us out
Lookin' all around and a-watchin' the world
Changing
Open up your eyes, you can see things rearranging
The world is ending
And if they say it's gon' be okay, they just pretending

When an Eskimo gets bit by a mosquito
Somebody in Miami will get swept by a tsunami
Rastas in Jamaica will get hit by a quake
That registers somethin' like eight point eight
You see, a situation's happening with our planet
'Cause twenty years we took it for granted
We shoulda took advantage and reversed the damage
Instead of just pumpin' and sellin' and slangin' the gas
And while we purchased the gas
We was watchin' soap operas while they steady brainwashed the masses
'Cause they can make a vehicle that runs off ashes
But they don't own a patent for that, and that's exactly what's happenin'
Corruption and bullshit politics
The planet's gonna die 'cause of bullshit politics
It's hotter in the winter, even hotter in the summer
And ain't nobody comin' to our rescue to help the—
