Isolations got to wrap you around one morning
Don't trade your love forever and more that you're growing
You're not the one you were
You are the one to be
Something you never got to try
'cos you're not the one you were
Please sing the song to me
Nothing's gonna make you down
Wow wow
Isolations got to wrap you around one morning

You're not the one you were
You are the one to be
Something you never got to try
'cos you're not the one you were
Please sing the song to me
Nothing's gonna make you down
Wow wow
I remember how we used to play in the yard
So I made another choices from you so long so long
So long, so long...
Isolations got to wrap you around one morning
You're not the one you were
You are the one to be
Something you never got to try
'cos you're not the one you were
Please sing the song to me
Nothing's gonna make you down
You're not the one you were
(You're not the one you were)
You're not the one to me
(You're not the one to me)
