All the holes at once
Are comin' alive, set free
Out of sight and out of mind
The lonely and their prey

The one you light your fires to keep away
Is crawling out upon its belly
And all you have to do is say "Yes"

All the birds stay up in the trees
All the fish swim down to the deep
The lonely and their prey
I am here, come to me before it's too late

The one you light your fires to keep away
Is crawling out upon its belly
All you have to do is say "Yes"
