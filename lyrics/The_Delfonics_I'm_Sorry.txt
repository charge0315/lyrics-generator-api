My love, I ran around on you
Yes, I broke your heart in two
And I want the world to know I'm sorry (Sorry)
So, if by chance, you want to know
If I really love you so
All you have do to is come and ask me

And nevermind what they say
Nevermind what they do

I'll tell you tra-la-la-la-la-la
Know that I love you
Tra-la-la-la-la-la
Know that I love you

Now I hunger for your touch
I never knew you meant so much
I know that I have hurt you and I'm sorry (Sorry)
So, darling, take me back again
And our love will never end
Don't listen to the whole world talk about me

Please nevermind what they say
Nevermind what they do

I'll tell you tra-la-la-la-la-la
Know that I love you
Tra-la-la-la-la-la
Know that I love you

Ooh, girl
And I want the world to know I'm sorry (Sorry)
And nevermind what they say
Nevermind what they do
Tra-la-la-la-la-la
Know that I love you
Tra-la-la-la-la-la
Know that I love you (I wanna hold you tight)
Tra-la-la-la-la-la (Yeah, yeah)
