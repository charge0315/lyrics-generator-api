Hand with fire
Stickin' to the stained sky
White desire and deep affection fill her crown
She never turns her hair
When we're driven out to empty dreams by a big wave of mode
Now everybody, stop and look before you're drowned
The state of independence reflected in her eyes
Lady navigation
I'm watching over you pray on the sea (pray on the sea)
Teardrops of sensation
Falling into the waves drift to the East
I'm watching over you (watching over you)
Ain't no closed mind
She's just gonna have no prejudice
Across the borderline
Hey! Give me a kiss of liberty
Anything in her sight would be full of life
Primitive pleasure everywhere
Oh. Won't be satisfied with tow-bit gossip anymore
I gotta go to get the steering wheel of my own
Lady navigation
I'm watching over you pray on the sea
Teardrops of sensation
Falling into the waves drift to the East
I'm watching over you, please come along to my ears
You're so naive, hey...
Oh...
Dont' go...
Come get close to me babe...
Come get close to me...
Get close...
Closer...
Very close...
