Sweet friction
You're drivin' the kid up a wall
It's showtime
He's lookin' for somewhere to fall
In south town
The dreamers all know you by name
Sweet friction
Small wonder, ooh
You know how to soften the pain
You think you're priceless
You'll never be more than a loan
Sweet friction
In darkness, ooh
A voice at the end of the phone
There can be no doubt
There can be no hesitation
If it don't work out
We don't need a reservation, no
Keep pushin', keep pushin'
Sweet thing
You're backin' my heart up a hill
Sweet friction
In deadlock, ooh
It's down to a battle of wills
In dreamland
The stars are pretending to shine
Sweet friction
Stay with me, ooh
I'm layin' my love on the line
You work your good thing
And time will surrender the rest
Sweet friction
Don't try me, ooh
You know I've been tried by the best
There can be no doubt
There can be no hesitation
If it don't work out
We won't need a reservation, no
Keep pushin', keep pushin', ooh
 with you, baby
 with you, baby
Work your good thing
And time will surrender the rest
Sweet friction
Don't try me, ooh
You know I've been tried by the best
There can be no doubt
There can be no hesitation
If it don't work out
We won't need a reservation, no
Keep pushin', keep pushin', pushin'
