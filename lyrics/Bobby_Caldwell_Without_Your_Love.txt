Love, if you don't know by now
What's in my heart
If you're in doubt
Let me straighten you out
If you were to leave
What would I do
In a world without you

Don't walk away if all you need to hear
Is a pledge of my devotion
Let me make it clear

Girl without your love
What would become of me
I would be half a man
That's the cold reality
If the reason was gone
To wake up and carry on
I'd rather die than live without your love

You can believe when I say
That there's no one else
Our love is strong
So don't think something's wrong
Just rest assured
I need you more
Than ever before

So if you think
That I wouldn't agonize
At the thought of you leaving
Let me open your eyes

Girl without your love
What would become of me
I would be half a man
On the edge of sanity
And that's too great a cost
'Cause each day I'd feel the loss
I'd rather die than live without your love

So if you think
That I wouldn't agonize
At the thought of you leaving
Let me open your eyes

Girl without your love
What would become of me
I would be half a man
That's the cold reality
If the reason was gone
To wake up and carry on
I'd rather die than live without you
What would I do living without you
(Without your love)
What would become of me
I would be half a man
That's the cold reality
If the reason was gone
To wake up and carry on
I'd rather die than live without you
What would I do living without you
