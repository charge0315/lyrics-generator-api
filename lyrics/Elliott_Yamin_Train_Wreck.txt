Mmmhmmmm
Oh yeaaaah yeaaah
Mmmm
We're heading for a train wreck
I gotta be honest with you baby
I knew it right from the start
Without knowing the cost to my soul
I paid for it with my heart
They say to be careful what you wish
What you want ain't what you need
Second thoughts have got me thinking over
Maybe we're in too deep
And I'm so helpless
What's the point of building up just to tear it all down
And I, should care less
But you know I just can't
I can't help wanting you around
Whatever we do
Better think it through
'Cause we're moving too fast
We are strangers
Heading for a train wreck
When it feels this good
Gotta hurt so bad
This just can't last
We are strangers
Heading for a train wreck
And we're getting to the point of no return
'Cause baby when I give my heart
There ain't no turning back
No it ain't
And I've lived through lessons learned
So, I just can't sit around
Waiting for the love to burn
Whatever we do
Gotta think it through
'Cause we're moving too fast
We are strangers
Heading for a train wreck
When it feels this good
Gotta hurt so bad
Baby, this just can't last
We are strangers
Heading for a train wreck
I gotta be honest with you baby
I knew it right from the start
I guess all I knew
Is we were heading for a train wreck
Whatever we do(gotta think it through)
Strangers, heading for a train wreck
