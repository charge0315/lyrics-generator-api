I'm on it like infrared
She need in her life like, cigarettes
She get a billion likes i bet
I'ma spoil more of my friends when my life gets set
You a lie, and you put that on ya life i bet
It was cool but you'd really think that i'd forget
Make a move withcha, moves hitcha
Twice as quick
You'll never meet nobody like me in your this life
This is it
This hate on me's enough to make someone evil
All my enemies are dead, i think i stunt for no reason
But i can't turn it down to make somebody feel equal
I guess just cannot get along with too many people
I hit it once then im good with it
It was good but she all on my back
Coke, selling like $40 for premium snap
Selling like socks, roll in my racks
Just got a call that you had an opinion about me that you out here calling, facts
I don't argue, i snap
I hope it hurts your heart when i ball
That shit get you jumped like parkour
I go overboard since i saw Saw 4
Dial up links, my wrist uncalled for
I'm on it like infrared
She need in her life like, cigarettes
She get a billion likes i bet
I'ma spoil more of my friends when my life gets set
You a lie, and you put that on ya life i bet
It was cool but you'd really think that i'd forget
Make a move withcha, moves hitcha
Twice as quick
You'll never meet nobody like me in your this life
This is it
Ball on my wrist, i'm too rocky
Watch got a face like Bukkake
Ice, a nigga skate, like i do hockey
Don't touch my face, hoe i'm too saucy
I need space, like a flying saucer
I just want chips, you can keep the salsa
Too much drip, i'ma need a doctor
Drip in ya mouth, make you chewbacca
Clip in ya mouth, make you chew chalk
And beat the case like Guwap
Miracle in ya face, if it do stop
You're gonna see flying pigs and cool cops

I hope it hurts your heart when i ball
That shit get you jumped like parkour
I go overboard since i saw Saw 4
Dial up links, my wrist uncalled for
