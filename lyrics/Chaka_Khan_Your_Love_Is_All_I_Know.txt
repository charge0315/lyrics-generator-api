In my mind
I only see your face
And time will not erase
What I feel for you, feel for you
In my heart
It was always you and me
It's how I thought it would be
Forever and ever

Where do I go
What do I do
After all that we've been through
How do I turn around
Just turn around and watch you go
'Cause baby, your love is all I know

The touch of your hand
And the warmth of your embrace
I always had a place
Here in your arms
I felt so secure
I didn't need anything more

Where do I go
What do I do
After all that we've been through
How do I turn around
Just turn around and watch you go
Can't do it, baby
'Cause baby, your love is all I know

Tell me how can you walk away
And find somebody new
When I can't see myself
With anyone but you, oh, oh, oh
-

Where do I go
What do I do
After all that we've been through
How do I turn around
Just turn around and watch you go
'Cause baby, your love is all
Baby, baby, baby, your love is all
Baby, your love is all I know
