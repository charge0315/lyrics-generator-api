Two months of fun
Two years of pain
Add it up
I get a life of rain
Need to scream
But too ashamed

Gonna rain, gonna rain
You wanna go, you wanna stay
You wanna
You really blew my world
I wanna live, and there's only one way

I don't wanna die anymore
I want to live it up
I don't want this high anymore
But I can't give it up
I won't live a lie anymore
I need to give you up
Won't you save me?

Two months of sun
A life of rain
Add it up
I'm on my own again
Need to scream
I'm so filled with rage (rage)

Gonna rain, gonna rain
You wanna go, you wanna stay
You wanna
You really screwed my world
I gotta live, but you stand in the way
I'm pullin' out now, uh

I don't wanna die anymore
I want to live it up
I don't want this high anymore
But I can't give it up
I won't live a lie anymore
I need to give you up, oh oh oh

Oh, baby
Did you think that I was strong?
Oh, baby
Can't you see that you were wrong?
Oh, honey
Did you think that I was strong?
Ah

I don't wanna die anymore
I want to live it up
I don't want this high anymore
But I can't give it up
I won't live a lie anymore
I need to give you up, give you up, give you up
You got me really going out of my mind

Oh, baby
Did you think that I was strong?
Oh, honey
Can't you see that you were wrong?
Oh, baby
Did you think that I was strong?
Ah
Oh, baby
Did you think that I was strong?
Oh, honey
Can you see that you were wrong?
Oh baby
Can't you see that's all we lost?
