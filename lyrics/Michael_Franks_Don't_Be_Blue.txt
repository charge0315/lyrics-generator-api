Don't be blue, you ain't got far to go
You see better when you're movin' slow
Don't get locked into your sadness
Cop a bluff
Strut your stuff
If you stumble just be tongue-in-cheek
Love is always just like hide-and-seek
Antony and Cleopatra did it too
So don't, just don't be blue
If this high-speed hassle gets you down
Remember, everyone is lost until they're found
Don't be blue, the sun is bound to shine
After winter comes the summertime
If you're locked into your sadness
Cop a bluff
Strut your stuff
If you stumble just be tongue-in-cheek
Love is always just like hide-and-seek
Romeo and Juliet did it too
So don't, no don't be blue, just don't be blue
