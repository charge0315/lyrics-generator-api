Now never before put another man down
But if he can’t do it, why keep him around?
Now he be class as a part time provider
But let me tell you baby, I’m a full satisfier

Now he’s just learning how to
But I already know just what to do

So just take it off him and put it on me
Where I know it ought to be
Now, just take it off him and put it on me
Oh yeah

He really don’t love you anyway
He had his chance, girl, for he had his day
Why fool around with half a man
When I’ve got more love than you can stand

Now he’s just learning how to
But I already know just what to do

So just take it off him and put it on me
Where I know it ought to bе
Now, just take it off him and sock it on me
Woo!
And put it all on me
Takе it off baby, put it on me

Now diddling and daddling is all he knows
But when it comes to loving, he catches on slow
When he’s , now where will you be
So why waste it on him when you can put it on me

Now he’s just learning how to
But Clarence already knows just what to do

So take it off him and put it on me
Where I know it ought to be
Now, just take it off him and put it on me

Scrap it on me, sock it on me
Hook it on me, slide it on me
Glue it on me, hang it on me
Roll it on me, hook it on me
