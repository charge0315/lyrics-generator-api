What a prize
She will set your heart aflame
Big blue eyes
Sweet talkin' Hannah is her name
Rocks this town
Venus in a satin gown
Talks so sweet
When she whispers in your ear
What a treat
Makes all your troubles disappear
But take care
Hannah's kiss can curl your hair
She can make you moan and shout
Make Jack the Ripper and Eagle Scout
Make a preacher blow his cool
Hannah's talk
Sweet as honey, that's a fact
And that walk
Her moving parts
Are neatly stacked
You'll admit
There is nothing counterfeit
She will set your heart aflame
Sweet talking Hannah is her name
