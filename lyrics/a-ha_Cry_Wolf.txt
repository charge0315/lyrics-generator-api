Hello?
Night I left the city
I dreamt of a wolf

He came from where the winds are cold
And truth is seen through keyholes
Strange longings that'll never sleep
Now he's come where no heart beats, gotta

Gotta cry wolf
Time to worry
Cry wolf
Time to worry now

You can start, but you cannot stop
You give in, but you can't give up
You can tell all your desperate jokes
To a world that puts your love on hold

Gotta cry wolf
Time to worry
Cry wolf
Time to worry now
Cry wolf
Time to worry
Oh, cry wolf
Time to worry now

Dreamt of a wolf - a wolf...

The sunken-in eyes
And the pain in his cries
A shape in the dark (dark...)

(Cry) cry wolf
Time to worry
Cry wolf
Time to worry now
Now cry wolf
Time to worry, now
(Come on) cry wolf
Time to worry now
Cry wolf
Time to worry
Oh, cry wolf
Time to worry now
(Come on) cry wolf
Time to worry, now
Cry wolf
Time to worry now
Cry wolf
Cry wolf
Cry wolf
