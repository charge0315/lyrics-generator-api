When the lights are low
How can you resist when I kiss your ear?
I would like to know
If you've always felt the way I'm feeling, dear
There's just one chance for you & I
Let's make romance, don't let love slip by
You will regret
When the lights are low
How can you pretend that you just don't care?
Darling, can't you see there is love for me in your heart somewhere?

Don't let love slip through your hands
No, sweet darling, don't spoil my plans
Please don't hesitate, as my love won't wait for you oh

Now, love won't wait
Oh, don't you hesitate
How can you resist a tender kiss?
I love you
Darling, love won't wait
Aw, don't you hesitate
In my love you'll find
There is happiness for you

Don't let love slip through your hands
Oh, sweet darling, don't spoil my plans
Don't you hesitate cause my love won't wait for you

Oh, now love won't wait
Oh, don't you hesitate
How can you resist a tender kiss?
I love you
Darling, love won't wait
Don't you hesitate
In my love you'll find
There is happiness for you
