You're feelin' in it, yeah
You're ticklin' it, yeah
You're swimmin' in it, yeah
You're gonna get it (Moist, moist, moist)
You're feelin' in it, yeah
You're ticklin' it, yeah
You're swimmin' in it, yeah
You're gonna get it (Moist, moist, moist)

I'm insatiable and it's all your fault
So much lust involved to get me off
My water falls, your sexuality breeds
A storm inside of me, seas
A touch is all I need to make me scream obscenities

Every time you whisper in my ear I get aroused
You begin to slowly unbutton my blouse
Kissing on my skin my heart's racing now
I want you boy, ooh
'Caught up in the waves of passion up and down
Love the way you movin' my body all around
Boy you 'bout to make the rain come down
Boy you 'bout to make the rain come down

Feel my rain come, pourin', soakin', longin' your lips, baby
You make it so moist
When my ocean's overflowin', afterglowin' take me
You make me so moist

Orgasmic, row it just like that
Hope you like drownin' in it
You don't have a life jacket
My thirst is quenched
Oh, baby we're so drenched
Our bodies rhythms' are so cataclysmic, got me twisted

Feeling your anatomy breaking me down
Sucking on my, mmm with ice in your mouth
Hurry and undress me take me right now
I'm wet for you boy, ooh
Caught up in the waves of passion up and down
Love the way you movin' my body all around
Boy, you know you make the rain come down
You know how to make my rain come down

Feel my rain come, pourin', soakin', longin' your lips, baby
You make it so moist
When my ocean's overflowin', afterglowin' take me
You make me so moist, moist, moist, moist

You're feelin' in it, yeah
You're ticklin' it, yeah
You're swimmin' in it, yeah
You're gonna get it, moist
You're feelin' in it, moist
You're ticklin' it, moist
You're swimmin' in it
You're gonna get it, yeah
You're feelin' in it, yeah
You're ticklin' it, yeah
You're swimmin' in it, yeah
You're gonna get it, moist
You're feelin' in it, moist
You're ticklin' it, moist
You're swimmin' in it
You're gonna get it

Feel my rain come, pourin', soakin', longin' your lips, baby
You make it so moist
When my ocean's overflowin', afterglowin' take me
You make me so moist
Feel my rain come, pourin', soakin', longin' your lips, baby
You make it so moist
When my ocean's overflowin', afterglowin' take me
You make me so moist
Feel my rain come, pourin', soakin', longin' your lips, baby
You make it so moist
When my ocean's overflowin', afterglowin' take me
You make me so moist, moist, moist, moist
