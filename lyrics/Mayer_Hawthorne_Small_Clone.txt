Remember the time that I saw you
Drinking champagne through a straw
I asked if you minded Nirvana
You told me no, not at all

I should have known that you were trouble
Always looking for my double
Then I got that phone call, I was out of time
Now, who's next in line?

So you blew out the candles
And now you're all alone, can't you see
You never get what we had, no
Cause he's just a small clone to me
All alone, all alone, all alone, all alone
With a small clone to me
All alone, all alone, all alone, all alone
With a small clone to me

We had a table for two at Dan Tana's
I'll never forget that night
The telephone rang and you answered
You smiled and you took it outside

I should have known that you were trouble
Always looking for my double
Then I got that phone call, I was out of time
Now, who's next in line?

So you blew out the candles
And now you're all alone, can't you see
You never get what we had, no
Cause he's just a small clone to me
All alone, all alone, all alone, all alone
With a small clone to me
All alone, all alone, all alone, all alone
With a small clone to me

As the candles burned
I learned there was another standing by
I guess I'm no longer needed so I'll step aside

So you blew out the candles
And now you're all alone, can't you see
You never get what we had, no
Cause he's just a small clone to me
All alone, all alone, all alone, all alone
With a small clone to me
All alone, all alone, all alone, all alone
With a small clone to me
So you blew out the candles
And now you're all alone, can't you see
You never get what we had, no
Cause he's just a small clone to me
All alone, all alone, all alone, all alone
With a small clone to me
All alone, all alone, all alone, all alone
With a small clone to me
