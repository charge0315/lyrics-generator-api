Oh yeah
Oh, whoa
Oh-ooh
Yeah

I was born, raised on the same plantation
In the United States of the red, white, and blue
Never knew that I was different
'Til Dr. King was on a balcony lyin' in a bloody pool
I expected so much more from a loving
A loving, lovin' society
A truthful explanation, you know what?
I got another, another conspiracy

If it was just a dream, listen
Call me, call me a dreamer too

More rewards and accolades than anyone before or after
21st century, oh, what a shame, what a shame, race, race still matters
A race to what? And where we goin'?
We in the same boat, but I'm the only one rowin'

Last time I checked, you were sleepin'
But you can call me a dreamer too
Uh, what’s up with this?

Yeah
Oh
Yeah
Ow
Uh

Peanut butter logic, served on a bread of lies
Don't go down too easy when you've seen your father cry
Have you ever clutched the steerin' wheel in your car too tight?
Prayin' that the police sirens just pass you by that night?
While the helicopter circles us, theories gettin' deep
Think they're sprayin' chemicals over the city while we sleep

From now on, I'm stayin' awake
You can call me a dreamer too

Oh, I got one eye open for the devils
Oh yeah, oh yeah, no
Come on! Come on!
Wake up
Please wake up
So what's it feel like?
Do you feel like
You must be dreaming?
Time to wake up
Wake up, wake up
I pledge allegiance to...
