Can you feel it, tell me can you feel it?
Can you feel it, tell me can you feel it?
I believe it's real

It's time to tell you of a secret I keep
How I get with you when the world's asleep
I can't wait for the long day to end
Then I can be back in your arms again

When I close my eyes
You are by my side
And I can picture us together
Every night I pray there will be a way
And we can make it last forever

I dream I'm dancing with you
And I can really move
I dream you're kissing me
And I can really feel it
I dream I'm dancing with you
And I can really move
I dream you're kissing me
And I can really feel it
Swear I can really feel it
Swear I can really feel it

I don't mind living in a fantasy world
I know how it feel to be your girl
And hear you say the sweetest things soft and low
I never wanna wake up and let you go, no

When I close my eyes
You are by my side
And I can picture us together
Every night I pray there will be a way
And we can make it last forever

I dream I'm dancing with you
And I can really move
I dream you're kissing me
And I can really feel it
I dream I'm dancing with you
Until we lose control
I dream you're loving me
With all your heart and soul

Someday soon I'm gonna make this dream come true
I can't deny that I'm so into you
I want you so that I forget to breathe air
The feeling grows so strong
I believe
Can you feel it, tell me can you feel it?
Can you feel it, tell me can you feel it?
It's real

Every night I pray
I will find a way
To make it last forever

I dream I'm dancing with you
And I can really move
And I can really feel it
I dream I'm dancing with you
Until we lose control
I dream you're loving me
With all your heart and soul
I dream I'm dancing with you
And I can really move
I dream you're kissing me
And I can really feel it
I dream I'm dancing with you
Until we lose control
I dream you're loving me
With all your heart and soul
Swear I can really feel it
Swear I can really feel it

I believe it's real
I believe it's real
It's real
