I know she wants, I know she wants you
I know she wants, I know she wants you
I know she wants, I know she wants you
I know she wants, I know she wants you

Boy I know you better
That you think you know yourself
I know where you're coming from
Seeing you together and I swear I can tell
There's something going on

I've seen her expression
As she looks in your direction
It's there, in her eyes
You say there's no connection
You don't think that's her intention
Baby, you must be blind

I know that she wants you (She wants you, she wants you)
I know it instinctively (I know she wants, I know she wants you)
I know that she wants you (She wants you, she wants you)
You say you're in love with me (I know she wants, I know she wants you)

Boy you think I'm crazy
You say she don't mean a thing
That I'm the one for you
She just wants your body, baby
She don't give a damn
What I've been going through

She wants satisfaction, to be centre of attraction
It's clear, to me
She needs no imitations
She's got such determination
Baby, you still don't see

I know that she wants you (She wants you, she wants you)
I know it instinctively (I know she wants, I know she wants you)
I know that she wants you (She wants you, she wants you)
You say you're in love with me (I know she wants, I know she wants you)

You understand
You take my hand
You're proud to be my man
And I won't let you go

I've seen her expression
As she looks in your direction
It's there, in her eyes
You say there's no connection
You don't think that's her intention
Baby, you must be blind

I know that she wants you (She wants you, she wants you)
I know it instinctively (I know she wants, I know she wants you)
I know that she wants you (She wants you, she wants you)
You say you're in love with me (I know she wants, I know she wants you)
I know that she wants you (She wants you, she wants you)
I know it instinctively (I know she wants, I know she wants you)
I know that she wants you (She wants you, she wants you)
You say you're in love with me (I know she wants, I know she wants you)

(I know she wants, I know she wants you)
(I know she wants, I know she wants you)
(I know she wants, I know she wants you)
(I know she wants, I know she wants you)
