I take what I want
I'm a bad go-getter, yeah, yes I am
I'm never a loser and I'm never a quitter, yeah, oh no
'Cause I take what I want, yeah yeah
Baby, I want you, yes, you

I've been watchin' you walk by
And I haven't said a word, not one word
But now I'm ready to get you
And I'm gonna make you my girl, my lovin' girl
'Cause I take what I want, yeah yeah
Baby, I want you

Gonna pick you up now, carry you away, yes I am
So you better pack up now, baby, pack him up today
Here I come, just a big bad man
When I walk away, baby, you'll be holding my hand

'Cause I take what I want
I'm a bad go-getter, yeah, yes I am
But now I'm ready to get you
And I'm gonna make you my girl, my lovin' girl
'Cause I take what I want, yeah
Baby, I want you

(Nobody but you, baby) What do you need now?
(Nobody but you) Your love to be by my side
Your heart (To be by my guide)
Told your mind (I love you, baby)
Nothin' but your soul (I love you, baby)
Alright (I'll tell you what I want, girl)
Mr. Pitiful, that's we gon' call him
(And I want you) He's alright (And I want you)
