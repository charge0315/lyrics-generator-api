Well she wants to be a singer in the band
Maybe I'll give the girl a hand and a microphone, looks like she's all alone
She can bring a friend, though she's not my kind of friend
She keeps on staring me out with her ol' black 'n' blue eyes

And I can take her dancing just to give the girl a chance
And I was never that good at being nice when I should
I guess that she'll forgive me, right before she tries to kill me
'Cause I sold her on yesterday's come-take-me-home eyes

And I can take her waltzing just so she could kick my head in
Oh, I do believe I was drunk and both of my heads had shrunk
I guess her name was Tina 'cause before I'd even seen her
I was lost in her "what's-your-name, just get me fucked" eyes

"Oh, take me home" eyes

And Chelsea said she's got nowhere to go
And if she does, she's getting there slow
And I can help her out, but I've got somewhere to be
And that's the very thing when you're dealing with me

Young soul Dagger, beggin' me to bag her
Filthy heart and swollen hips, and she said
"Oh my dearest I'm not pretty, isn't it a pity
That you won't kiss these rotten lips?"

So take me home eyes
Ole black 'n' blue eyes

And Chelsea said she's got nowhere to go
And if she does, she's getting there slow
And I can help her out, but I've got somewhere to be
And that's the very thing when you're dealing with me

Do do do do do do do do do...
