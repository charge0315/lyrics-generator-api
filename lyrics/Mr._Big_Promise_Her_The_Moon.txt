Hey, yeah, yeah
You don't know what you've got
Till the love is almost gone
This time, yeah, she's given up
Still in a state of shock
I should've seen it coming on
It's too late for waking up
Her mind's made up
I know the dream is over
But my heart just can't let go
She's too good to be forgotten
Too good to be true
Before my world is torn apart
I'll promise her the moon
I'll promise her the moon
I was too blind to notice her
Wrapped up in myself
Workin' hard overtime, night and day
I thought we were so secure
Can' imagine someone else
Could come between us
And take her away
Her mind's made up
I know the dream is over
But my heart just can't let go
She's too good to be forgotten
Too good to be true
Before my world is torn apart
I'll promise her the moon
I'll promise her the moon
And all the time she stood by me
I never said "I love you"
Yeah, I kept it deep down in my soul
And all the while I've been a fool
Yeah, yeah, yeah
