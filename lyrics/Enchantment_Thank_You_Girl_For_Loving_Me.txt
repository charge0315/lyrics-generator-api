Chorus: Thank you girl for loving me - when others passed me by;
Thank you girl for loving me - you really saved this guy
Baby, I owe you my life and everything that I possess
And I-I-I just want to thank you love for giving me joy and happiness
Before I met you baby, life to me, was so unkind
But you pick me up, you showed me the way, you turned me on to piece of mind
Chorus: Thank you girl for loving me (wanna thank you, baby) - when others passed me by (Whoa);
Thank you girl for loving me (you really helped me out now, baby) - you really saved this guy (Well, Oh, Whoa)
There I was, lost and confused - encaged by loneliness; pieces of a man broken in two, with no hope for happiness
Whoa, but then you came, you came with a key; and you opened up the door
You gave me love, you gave me love; now, I don't have to worry no more
Chorus: Thank you girl for loving me (Wanna thank you, baby) - when others passed me by; Thank you girl for loving me (came to see about me, girl) - you really saved this guy
I wanna thank you (Oh, whoo)!
(Heeey) Before I met you baby, life to me, was so unkind
But you pick me up, you showed me the way, you turned me on to piece of mind
Chorus: (yea, ooh) Thank you girl for loving me (wait a minute) - when others passed me by (oh, when the others passed me by)(you came in my life, and you took my hand, you let me know that you understand)(baby, I want to be your man); Thank you girl for loving me - you really saved this guy (I thank you, baby, thank you for your tender love)
Chorus: Thank you girl for loving me (I wanna squeeze you, I wanna tease you) - when others passed me by (most of all, I wanna please you, baby) ; Thank you girl for loving me - you really saved this guy
