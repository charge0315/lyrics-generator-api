Good lovin'
Ow, yeah

I can't sleep at night, I toss and turn
Listening for the telephone
But when I get your call, I'm all choked up
Can't believe you called my home
And as a matter of fact, it blows my mind
You would even talk to me
Because a girl like you is like a dream come true
A real life fantasy

No matter what your friends try to tell you
We were made to fall in love
And we will be together, any kind of weather
It's like that, it's like that

Every little step I take, you will be there
Every little step I make, we'll be together
Every little step I take, you will be there
Every little step I make, we'll be together

I can't think too straight, I'm all confused
You must've put a thing on me
Because there aren't no words that can explain
I'm livin' in ecstasy
And you can best believe, I got your back
You never have to feel no pain
'Cause I'll dedicate my life to you
You'll never look for love again

No matter what your friends try to tell you
We were made to fall in love
We'll always be together, any kind of weather
It's like that, it's like that

Every little step I take, you will be there
Every little step I make, we'll be together
Every little step I take, you will be there
Every little step I make, we'll be together

Every little (Woo)
Every little step I (Every little step)
Every little, every little step I take (Oh no)
Every little
Every little step I (Every little step)
Every little, we'll be together, girl
Good lovin'
Good lovin'

No matter what your friends try to tell you
We were made to fall in love
And we will be together, any kind of weather
It's like that, it's like that, girl

Every little step I take, you will be there (You'll, you'll be there)
Every little step I make, we'll be together
Every little step I take, you will be there (You, you'll be there)
Every little step I make, we'll be together

Every little step I take (Oh no), you will be there
Every little step I make, we'll be together (You, you'll be there)
Every little step I take (Every step), you will be there
Every little step I make, we'll be together (We will be together)

Every little
Every little step I (Every little step)
Every little, every little step I take (Oh no)
Every little
Every little step I (Every little step)
Every little, we'll be together, girl
Every little step I take (Good lovin'), you will be there
Every little step I make, we'll be together
