It's over, I made up my mind
You won't see me again, again
It's older, after my time
I won't jump back on the train
Don't you know that I've been
Runnin' since I was 16
My feet are just so heavy
That I can't bear to stand
One more look at you
Just so I don't forget
One more look at you
Then I'll let you go
One more look at you
Just so I don't forget
One more look at you
Then I'll let you go
Go back home
I know for sure
Anything can happen
I don't care
Run, run, let's fall in the sea
 you and me
Run, run, let's fall in the sea
 you and me
