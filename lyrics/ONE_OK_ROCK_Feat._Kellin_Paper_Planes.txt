From paper planes, to hand grenades
I'm gonna take you out
From paper planes, to hand grenades
I'm gonna take you out
Try and change me, rearrange me
You're so crazy in the head (In the head)
Pull me closer
To the vultures'
But I won't be left for dead
You make me wanna go harder
Go a little bit larger
My fire starter
I'm gasoline (I'm gasoline)
You make me feel so jaded
You're overrated
Burn up the pages
I'm kerosene
Money can talk but words are cheap
So I'm gonna cash in, cash out
I'm taking my dollars and my dreams
So I'm gonna cash in, cash out
From paper planes, to hand grenades
I'm gonna take you out (Take you out)
From paper planes, to hand grenades
I'm gonna take you out
Can't contain me
In the mazes
I'll be breaking, through the seams
Leaving traces
That I'm making
Folding paper into wings
Money can talk but words are cheap
So I'm gonna cash in, cash out
I'm taking my dollars and my dreams
So I'm gonna cash in, cash out
Oh, yeah, show me what you got
Are you ready?
1, 2
1, 2, 3
I'm not worried about a thing
No dollar bill is worth the price you pay
Don't need your money
I don't need the fame
So I cash in, cash out
Cash in, cash out
Give me your car and your diamond ring
I'll burn it all to see the look on your face
What's it cost and is it worth the pain?
No, I cash in, cash out
Cash in, cash out
No, no, no, no
No, no, no, no
No, no, no, no
Cash in, cash out
Cash in, cash out
Money can talk but the words are cheap
So I'm gonna cash in, cash out
I'm taking my dollars and my dreams
So I'm gonna cash in, cash out
Paper planes (Paper planes) and hand grenades (Hand grenades)
Paper planes (Paper planes) and hand grenades (Hand grenades)
From paper planes, to hand grenades
I'm gonna take you out
From paper planes, to hand grenades
I'm gonna take you out
