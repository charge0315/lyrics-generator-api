I seen a hand, I seen a vision
It was reaching through the clouds to risk a dream
The shadow crossed the sky
And it crushed it to the ground, just like a beast

The old man's back again
The old man's back again

I seen a woman standing in the snow
She was silent as she watched them take her man
Teardrops burned her cheeks
For she'd thought she'd heard the shadow had left this land

The old man's back again
The old man's back again

The crowds just gathered, their faces turned away
And they queue all day like dragons of disgust
Older women whispering
Wondering just what these young hot-heads want of us
And Andrei V. he cries, with eyes that ring like chimes
His anti-worlds go spinning through his head
He burns them in his dreams
For half-awake, they may as well be dead

The old man's back again
I see he's back again

I see a soldier, he's standing in the rain
For him there's no old man to walk behind
Devoured by his pain
Bewildered by the faces who pass him by
He'd like another name
The one he's got's a curse, these people cried
Why can't they understand?
His mother called him Ivan, then she died

The old man's back again
The old man's back again
I can see him back again
Da da da da da da da da
Dwee-daba da dwee-daba da dwee-daba da dwee-daba da da da da dododo dee dada dada da dadadadada!
