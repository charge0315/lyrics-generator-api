I've been watching you for days now, baby
I just love your sexy ways now, baby
You know my love will never stop now, baby
Just put your loving in my box, baby

Wrap it up, I'll take it
Wrap it up, I'll take it

No more will I shop around, baby
I know I got the best thing in town, baby
I've seen all I want to see, baby
Bring your loving straight to me now, baby

Wrap it up, yeah, I'll take it
Wrap it up, I'll take it
Wrap, wrap it up, I'll take it, ooh-wee
Wrap it up, I'll take it

Ow, Good God almighty, come on
Ooh, I'm gonna treat you like the queen you are
Bring you sweet things from my candy jar
'Cause you've got tricks you ain't never used
Give it, give it to me, it won't get abused

I've been watching you for days now, baby
I just love your sexy ways, oh baby
You know my love will never stop, baby
Just put your loving in my box, ooh baby

Wrap it up, I'll take it
Wrap it up, I'll take it
