Where are you going
You're already there
When will you see it
The same everywhere
Run if you want to
There's no one to blame
Find all the pieces
They're always the same
Cause only love can find your heart
Cause only love takes you in
It's a game only fools can win
A name in the phone book
It's someone you know
A face in the window with no place to go
Tell her a story, be sure that it's true
Now she's in love and it's all up to you
Cause only love can find your heart
Cause only love takes you in
It's a game only fools can win
Maybe she will believe it, if you want her to
When will you know that it's all up to you
It's all up to you
It's all up to you
She's in love with you, boy
It's all up to you
