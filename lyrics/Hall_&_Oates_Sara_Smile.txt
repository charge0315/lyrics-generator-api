Baby hair, with a woman's eyes
I can feel you watchin' in the night
All alone with me and we're waiting for the sunlight

When I feel cold, you warm me
And when I feel I can't go on
You come and hold me
It's you and me forever

Sara, (smile) smile
Oh, won't you (smile) smile awhile for me, Sara

If you feel like leavin', you know you can go
But why don't you stay until tomorrow
If you want to be free
You know all you got to do is say so

When you feel cold, I'll warm you
And when you feel you can't go on
I'll come and hold you
It's you and me forever

Sara, (smile) smile
Oh, won't you (smile) smile awhile for me, Sara
Sara, (smile) smile
Oh, won't you smile (smile) awhile for me, Sara

(Smile) Smile awhile
Oh, won't you smile (smile) awhile for me, Sara
Woah, (smile) smile awhile
Won't you laugh, Sara
So thank you (smile) for making me
Make me feel like a man
Not keeping me crazy, crazy
(Smile) Smile awhile, oh
(Smile)
