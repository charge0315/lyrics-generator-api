You know this thing's got you now
It's moving in circles off the ground
It's like living your dreams
Where everything is easier than it seems
The carousel, the merry-go-round
Make you feel you've got no bounds
Driving in your bumper car
You feel you could go so far
Do you like being there?
Do you like being at the fun fair?
There's no safety net
When you miss the target
You don't feel anything, anymore
Nobody can hurt you now that
You're in your protective shell
You don't fear anything, anymore
Watch out boy, this could be your final cell
Do you like being at the fun fair?
Do you like being at the fun fair?
Watch out boy, this could be your final cell
Watch out boy, this could be your final cell
Do you like being at the fun fair?
