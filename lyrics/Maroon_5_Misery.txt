Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah

So scared of breakin' it that you won't let it bend, uh
And I wrote two hundred letters I will never send, uh
Sometimes these cuts are so much deeper than they seem
And you'd rather cover up, I'd rather let them bleed

So let me be
And I'll set you free (Oh, yeah)

I am in misery
There ain't nobody who can comfort me, oh, yeah
Why won't you answer me?
The silence is slowly killin' me, oh, yeah
Girl, you really got me bad
You really got me bad
Now I'm gonna get you back
I'm gonna get you back (Yeah)

Your salty skin and how it mixes in with mine, uh
The way it feels to be completely intertwined, uh
And not that I didn't care, it's that I didn't know, uh
It's not what I didn't feel, it's what I didn't show

So let me be
And I'll set you free

I am in misery
And there ain't nobody who can comfort me, oh, yeah
Why won't you answer me?
The silence is slowly killin' me, oh, yeah

Girl, you really got me bad
You really got me bad
Now I'm gonna get you back
I'm gonna get you back (And I wanna get you back), yeah

You say your faith is shakin'
And you may be mistaken
You keep me wide awake and waiting for the sun
I'm desperate and confused
So far away from you
And I'm gettin' there, I don't care where I have to run

Why do you do what you do to me? Yeah
Why won't you answer me, answer me? Yeah
Why do you do what you do to me? Yeah
Why won't you answer me, answer me? Yeah

I am in misery
And there ain't nobody who can comfort me, oh, yeah
Why won't you answer me?
The silence is slowly killin' me, oh, yeah

Girl, you really got me bad
You really got me bad
Now I wanna get you back
And I'm gonna get you back (Uh, come on)

Girl, you really got me bad
You really got me bad (You got me bad)
Now I'm gonna get you back
I'm gonna get you back (Gonna get you back)
Girl, you really got me bad
You really got me bad
Now I'm gonna get you back
I'm gonna get you back
Girl, you really got me bad
You really got me bad
Now I'm gonna get you back
I'm gonna get you back
