There must have been an angel by my side
Something heavenly led me to you
Look at the sky, it's the colour of love
There must have been an angel by my side
Something heavenly came down from above
He led me to you, he led me to you

He built a bridge to your heart, all the way
How many tonnes of love inside? I can't say

When I was led to you, I knew you were the one for me
I swear the whole world could feel my heartbeat
When I lay eyes on you, I-I-I-I-I
You wrap me up in the colour of love

You gave me the kiss of life, kiss of life
You gave me the kiss that's like, kiss of life

Wasn't it clear from the start?
Look, the sky is full of love
Yeah, the sky is full of love

He built a bridge to your heart, all the way
How many tonnes of love inside? I can't say

You gave me the kiss of life, kiss of life
You gave me the kiss that's like, the kiss of life
You gave me the kiss of life, kiss of life
You gave me the kiss that's like, the kiss of life

You gave me the kiss of life, kiss of life (Oh, yeah)
You gave me the kiss that's like, the kiss of life

You wrapped me up in the colour of love in the moonlight, baby
It must have been an angel came down from above
Giving me love, yeah
Giving me love, yeah
You gave me the kiss of life, kiss of life
You gave me the kiss of life
