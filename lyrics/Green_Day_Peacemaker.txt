One, two, three, four

Well, I got a fever, a non-believer
I'm in a state of grace
For I am a Caesar, I'm gonna seize the day (Ay)
Well, call of the banshee, hey, hey
Hey-yay-yay-yay-yay
As God as my witness, the infidels are gonna pay
Well, call the assassin, the orgasm
A spasm of love and hate
For what will divide us? The righteous and the meek (Ay)
Well, call of the wild, hey, hey
Hey-yay-yay-yay-yay
Well, death to the girl at the end of the serenade

Vendetta, sweet vendetta
This Beretta of the night
This fire and the desire
Well, shots ringin' out on the holy parasite

Well, I am a killjoy from Detroit
I drink from a well of rage
I feed off the weakness with all my love (Ah)
Well, call up the captain, hey, hey
Hey-yay-yay-yay-yay
Well, death to the lover that you were dreamin' of
Well, this is a standoff, a Molotov
Cocktail's on the house
You thought I was a write-off, you better think again (Ay)
Well, call the peacemaker, hey, hey
Hey-yay-yay-yay-yay
I'm gonna send you back to the place where it all began

Vendetta, sweet vendetta
This Beretta of the night
This fire and the desire
Well, shots ringin' out on the holy parasite

Well, now the caretaker's the undertaker
So I'm gonna go out and get a peacemaker
This is a neo-Saint Valentine's massacre (Ah)
Well, call up the Gaza, hey, hey
Hey-yay-yay-yay-yay
Well, death to the ones at the end of the serenade

Well, death to the ones at the end of the serenade
Well, death to the ones at the end of the serenade
Well, death to the ones at the end of the serenade
