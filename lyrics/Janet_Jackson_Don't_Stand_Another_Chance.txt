Standing at the edge of time, 'bout to lose my mind
'Cause you tried to take him away from me, I won't let it be
You just walk into my life trying to take away my only prize
But you better give credit 'cause his love is right here for me

You don't stand another chance
You don't stand another chance
You don't stand another chance
You don't stand another chance

He belongs to me, just wait and see
Take him in his arms and give him love, not too much of me
Nothing you can do or say to make him look your way
So you better give credit 'cause it's gonna come walking my way

You don't stand another chance
You don't stand another chance (You don't stand it, baby)
You don't stand
You don't stand another chance
You don't stand, baby
You don't stand another chance (Ow!)
You don't stand another chance (You don't stand)
You don't stand another chance (Another chance)

Sit and wait at home 'bout to leave me alone (I know, baby)
You'll be with him when he's up not down to keep him on the ground
Let me tell you something, it's true he's not in love with you
So you better give credit 'cause it's nothing coming down your way

You don't stand another chance
Not a chance
You don't stand another chance
You don't stand, baby
You don't stand another chance (Ow)
Stand
You don't stand another chance

You don't stand
Well, you know somebody's gotta lose (You don't stand)
We all can't win
Maybe next time, okay? (Ooh)
You guys are confusing
Ow

You don't stand another chance
You don't stand
You don't stand another chance (You don't stand it, baby)
You don't stand, baby
You don't stand another chance
You don't stand
You don't stand another chance
Another chance
You don't stand another chance
You don't stand another chance
You don't stand another chance (You can't stand it)
