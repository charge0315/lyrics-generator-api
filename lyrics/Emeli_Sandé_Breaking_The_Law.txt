When you need to smile but you can't afford it
Go on, point it out, I'm gonna steal it
When the floor is more familiar than the ceiling
I will break in late at night, shake up how you feeling

I'll never stop breaking the law for you
I'll never stop, helping to pull you through
Whatever it takes to get what you need
Ignore the alarms, ignore the police
I'll never stop breaking the law for you

When you're taking steps, but you need to go faster
We can speed through streets so the shadows can't catch ya
When the corridors and all the stairs are making you tired
I will come for you, set the building on fire

I'll never stop breaking the law for you
I'll never stop, helping to pull you through
Whatever it takes to get what you need
Ignore the alarms, ignore the police
I'll never stop breaking the law for you
I'll never stop breaking the law for you
I'll never stop, helping to pull you through
Whatever it takes to get what you need
Ignore the alarms, ignore the police
I'll never stop breaking the law for you
