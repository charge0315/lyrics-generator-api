There's a light
And it's shining
In the night
For the soul who steers the flight
As the sidewalk dreamers
Slip across the scene looking to win
A stranger lights a candle
Out here in the wind
Let it rain down on the outsider
As he waits for the change
No reminder of the past
Safe within the sheltered arms
Of someone you will never know
A stand-in for the part
No one can tell you what to do
Only the heart within you
Oh, see all the faces
Go gently by
And the silence chills the fighter
In the eyes of the night
No reminder of the past
Safe within these sheltered arms at last
A light in the dark
No beast so fierce
Could change this view
Only the heart within you
