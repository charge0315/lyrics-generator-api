I wouldn't wanna be a chimney sweep
All black from head to foot
From climbing in them chimneys
And cleaning out that soot
With a broom and ladder and pail
The darkened walls I scale
And far, and high
I see a patch of sky
I'd rather be the gypsy
(I'd rather be the gypsy)
Who's camped at the edge of town
(Camped at the edge of town)
The one who has the dancing bear
(Dancing bear)
That follows him around
And he lifts his big foot up
He puts his big foot down
Then bows, then twirls
And dances 'round and 'round
I found I was a cabin boy
Last night as I did dream
Bound aboard a magic ship
For a land I'd never seen
And the moon, she filled our sails
And the stars, they steered our course
And on our bow
There was a golden horse
The queen eats fruit and candy
The bishop, nuts and cheese
And when I am a grown man
I'll taste just what I please
The honey from the bee
The shellfish from the sea
The earth, the wind, a girl
Someone to share these things with me
I wouldn't wanna be a chimney sweep
(I'd rather be a gypsy)
All black from head to foot
(Camped at the edge of town)
From climbing in them chimneys
(One who has a dancing bear)
And cleaning out that soot
(Who follows him around)
I'd rather be the gypsy
(Wouldn't wanna be a chimney sweep)
Who's camped at the edge of town
(All black from head to foot)
The one who has the dancing bear
(Climbing in them chimneys)
That follows him around
(Cleaning out that soot)
