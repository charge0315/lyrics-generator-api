(You've got to be my love) Won't you come to me?
(You've got to be) Baby, can't you see?
(You've got to be my love) That our hearts agree
(You've got to be) Sincerely I can say
(You've got to be my love) Our love will never stray
(You've got to be) 'Cause I'll love you every day
(You've got to be my love) Don't you wanna be my?
Here we are, just who we are
Chances are we'll be the stars
Reflection in each other's eyes
Image of where our love will rise
Makin' up for time we lost
Baby, you and I have paid the cost
Time we spent away so long
Seekin' out the right from wrong
Be my love, baby
My love, ba-di-ya-ba-ba
My love, baby
Be my love, ba-di-ya-ba-ba
And we know it's for sure in the night
Won't you be my love?
(You've got to be my love) Won't you come to me?
(You've got to be)
(You've got to be my love) Ah, ah, baby, can't you see?
(You've got to be)
(You've got to be my love) Sincerely I can say
(You've got to be)
(You've got to be my love) Love will never go away
Don't you wanna be my?
Seven nights and seven suns
Spread the time it all begun
Baby, please look in my eyes
End this doubt I have inside
I can teach you wonders of
Life and love and all it does
But show me how to give to you
Love that makes your dreams come true
Be my love, baby
My love, ba-di-ya-ba-ba
My love, baby
Be my love, ba-di-ya-ba-ba
And we know it's for sure in the night
Won't you be my love?
