I wanna be with you
Wanna be, wanna be, wanna be, be with ya
Wanna be, wanna be, wanna be, be with ya
Wanna be, wanna be, wanna be, be with ya
Wanna be, wanna be, be with ya
I wanna be with you
Yesterday seems like so long ago
This space I'm in reminds me so
Of the times I used to rip and run
Shootin' my guns, out for fun
As time passed by, I changed my point of view
Started to search for someone like you
You made me feel so much love from the heart
Enough to know we'll never part
(I wanna be with you)
Wanna be, wanna be, wanna be, be with ya
(That's all I want to do)
(I wanna be with you)
Wanna be, wanna be, wanna be, be with ya
(That's all I want to do)
(I wanna be with you)
Wanna be, wanna be, wanna be, be with ya
(That's all I want to do)
(I wanna be with you)
Wanna be, wanna be, be with ya
I wanna be with you
Look at you, like someone from a dream
You came to me in time of need
You are the best, you're different from the rest
You take the cake, for goodness sake
I take you out, to prove that it's true
The greatest love I ever knew
Is in my arms, for more than just a night
'Cause, baby, now you are my life
(I wanna be with you)
Wanna be, wanna be, wanna be, be with ya
(That's all I want to do)
(I wanna be with you)
Wanna be, wanna be, wanna be, be with ya
(That's all I want to do)
(I wanna be with you)
Wanna be, wanna be, wanna be, be with ya
(That's all I want to do)
(I wanna be with you)
Wanna be, wanna be, be with ya
I wanna be with you
Ba-ba-ba-di-ya
You're the greatest love I have known
