Oh love is teasin' and love is pleasin'
And love's a pleasure when first it is new
But as love grows older, it still grows colder
And fades away like the mornin' dew

Come all ye fair maids, now take a warnin'
Don't ever heed what a young man will say
He's like a star on a foggy mornin'
When you think he's near, he is far away

I left my father, I left my mother
I left my brothers and my sisters too
I left my home and my fond dwelling
My young man, for the sake of you

Oh love is teasin' and love is pleasin'
And love's a pleasure when first it is new
But as love grows older, it still grows colder
And fades away like the mornin' dew
