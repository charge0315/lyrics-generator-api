I love how your eyes close whenever you kiss me
And when I'm away from you I love how you miss me
I love the way you always treat me tenderly
But darlin' most of all
I love how your heart beats whenever I hold you
I love how you think of me without being told to
I love the way your touch is always heavenly
But darlin' most of all I love how you love me
I love how your eyes close whenever you kiss me
And when I'm away from you I love how you miss me
I love the way your touch is always heavenly
But darlin' most of all I love how you love me
I love how you hug me
I love how you squeeze me, tease me, please me
Love how you love me
I love how you love me
Love how you want me
Love how you you squeeze me, tease me, please me
Love how you love me
