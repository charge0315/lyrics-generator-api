Baby, you understand me now
Though sometimes you see that I am mad
No one can always be an angel
When every things goes, wrong you see some bad

I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood

Sometimes I'm so carefree
With a joy that's hard to hide
Most of the time I'm so full of worry
And then you're bound to see my other side

I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood
Don't let me be misunderstood

If I seem edgy, I want you to know
I never mean to take it out on you, no
If life has it's problems, I've got more than my share
That's one thing I never wanna do (Do, do, do)

'Cause I love you, baby
I'm just human
I've got thoughts like anyone
Sometimes I think I'll spend the rest of my life regretting
Some simple thing that I have done

And I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood

Don't let me be misunderstood
Oh yeah, don't let me be
Don't let me be, don't let me be
Oh, come on, come on now
Don't let me be, don't let me be
Don't let me be, come on, come on
Sometimes
Don't know what to do with myself
Sometimes, oh, oh yeah
I get so ashamed of myself
Yeah, yeah, so won't you understand me
I'm trying to understand you
Before you understand me, try and understand you
Won't you understand me, I'm trying to understand you
Won't you understand, oh, come on now
Don't let me be, don't let me be
Don't let me be, no, no, no
Don't let me be, don't let me be
Don't let me be misunderstood
