All the leaves are brown and the sky is gray
I've been for a walk on a winter's day
I'd be safe and warm if I was in L.A.

California dreamin' on such a winter's day

Stopped in to a church I passed along the way
Got down on my knees and I pretend to pray
You know the preacher likes the cold
He knows I'm gonna stay

California dreamin' (California dreamin')
On such a winter's day (Such a winter's day)

All the leaves are brown (All the leaves are brown)
And the sky is gray (And the sky is gray)
I've been for a walk on a winter's day (On a winter's day)
If I didn't tell him I could leave today

California dreamin' (California dreamin') on such a winter's day
(California dreamin') On such a winter's day
(California dreamin') On such a winter's day
