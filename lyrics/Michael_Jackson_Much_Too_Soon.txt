She was there, just sitting at the table
Thinking now that things won't be the same
And wouldn't you like to go with me?
And she answered, "No" to me
Well, I guess I learned my lesson much too soon
(Ooh-ooh-ooh)

I never thought she'd leave me here forever
But who knows just what the future brings
And wouldn't you like to go with me?
And she answered, "No" to me
Well, I guess I learned my lesson much too soon

Take away this never-ending sorrow
Take this lonely feelin' from my soul
If only I knew what things bring tomorrow
She'd be sitting here beside me
And my heart would fill with gold
Da-da-da-da-da-da

I hope to make a change now for the better
Never letting fate control my soul
And I'm hoping that my prayers will see
The day that she'll come back to me
But I guess I learned my lesson much too soon, ooh-ooh

Yes, I guess I learned my lesson much too soon
