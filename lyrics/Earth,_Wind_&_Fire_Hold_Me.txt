I really love the little things
Little things you say to me
Like tellin' me everyday
That I'm your world
I really love the way you kiss
Kiss me every time
Every time I see your
Beautiful face
Girl, everything you do
Feels good
But when I'm close to you
I feel so secure
I love...
Love it when you hold me (When you hold me)
So closely (So closely)
Feels good to me (Feels good to me)
Every time
Love it when you hold me (When you hold me)
So soothing (So soothing)
Feels good to me (Feels good to me)
Every time
Love it when you hold me
Baby, I love the sweet perfume
On your body
Girl, you know just how to get
Me in the mood, yeah
Baby, I love the way you call
The way you call my name
When we make love
Over and over again
Girl, everything you do
Feels good
But when I'm close to you
I feel so secure
I love...
Love it when you hold me (When you hold me)
So closely (So closely)
Feels good to me (Feels good to me)
Every time
Love the way you hold me (When you hold me)
So soothing (So soothing)
Feels good to me (Feels good to me)
Every time
Love it when you hold me
