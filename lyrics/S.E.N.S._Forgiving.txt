Calm may reign in Heaven
But all is ending here

Scream a little more
Believe with all your being...

Believe in nothing shining brighter than the sun
Take up the battle of contemplating God

Forging towards the sunset
Denying bitter reality
And in that desperate moment
Weigh the thoughts of true clarity
Make the darker world a lie, everyone (Making calls for war to enlight everyone)
But down here
All is ending

Push back
Pull Over
Having the slight of thought

Fucking hilarious, you thought it could be other
Get on your knees, choking/soaked in history's flaming cum

Forging towards the sunset
Denying bitter reality
And in that desperate moment
Weigh the thoughts of true clarity
Make the darker world a lie, everyone
Everyone

All that you have desired
All you could have loved
All you considered sacred
Bonds, Intentions, potentials, betrayals, lusts
Count for precisely naught
Give the lie to all sense of ‘is’ or ‘ought'

Forging towards the sunset
Denying bitter reality
And in that desperate moment
Weigh the thoughts of true clarity
Make the darker world a lie, everyone
Everyone
