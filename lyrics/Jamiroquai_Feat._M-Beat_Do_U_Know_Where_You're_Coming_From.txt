Oh, do you know where you're coming from?
Hey-hey-hey-hey-hey-hey
Nothing is as clear

Imagine in your mind
Oasis far and wide beyond our living
Sure enough I'm tired of trying to
Hang on while this world is spinning

I was left down
There was no light, there was no sound
Here in the dark
Fishing around for meaning
I had to ask someone I knew
Not so far away from where I was
She said

Hey, do you know
Mmmm, where you're coming from?
Hey, do you know
Now where you're going to?
She said
Hey, havе you been
Somewhere you'vе never ever been before?
I said, 'Well, nothing is as clear

Nothing is as clear without
A holding hand to gently guide you
Once that disappeared, but it's so close
Now that I'm here beside you

I was left down
There was no light, there was no sound
Here in the dark
Fishing around for meaning
I had to ask someone I knew
Not so far away from where I was
She said

Hey, do you know
Where you're coming from?
Hey, do you know
Now where you're going to?
She said
Hey, have you been
Somewhere you've never been before?
Now, nothing is as clear
(Owww)

Oh, Do you know
Now, where you're going to?
She said
Hey, do you know
Now where you're coming from?
Hey, have you been
Somewhere you've never ever been before?
Nothing is as clear

I was left down
I was left down
I was left down
I was left down
I was left down
I was left down
I was left down
I was left down
I was left down
I was left down
I was left down (I was left down)
I was left down (I was left down)
I was left down (I was left down)
I was left down (I was left down)
I was left down (I was left down)
I was left down (I was left down)
I was left down (I was left down)
I was left down (I was left down)
I was left down (I was left down)
I was left down (I was left down)

Imagine in your mind
Oasis far and wide beyond our living
Sure enough I'm tired of trying to
Hang on while this world is spinning

I was left down
There was no light, there was no sound
Here in the dark
Fishing around for meaning
I had to ask someone I knew
Not so far away from where I was
She said

Oh, do you know
Where you're coming from?
Hey, do you know
Where you're going to?
Hey, have you been
Somewhere you've never ever been before?
Oh, now nothing can ever be as so clear
