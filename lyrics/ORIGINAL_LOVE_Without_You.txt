One, two, three

What is romance without the one you love?
Well, it's heartbreak and misery without the one you love
You fool yourself and say "I'll forget him"
And knowing all the time that it's not so
You play the lonely role of Pagliacci
Crying all day and sad and hurting and much more
Life can seem so cruel
Without that one you love

You're like a dying rose in summer without the one you love
One telephone call
One line, one line or so
Could mean a world of difference
Just lovebirds, you'll never
You'll never, ever, ever, ever know
But life can seem so lonely without the one you love

One, one telephone call
You know that charge'll brighten me one line or so
All of this could mean a world of difference
Just lovebirds, you'll never, ever, ever know
But life can seem so low, so lonely
Without the one you, you love, mmm, mhm
