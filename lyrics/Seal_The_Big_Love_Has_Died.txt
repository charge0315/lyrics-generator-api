So confused I’m amazed I refused
To believe you’d never change in my time spent with you
Remember me we were young cool and free
And i believed in everything you aspired to be
Love is blind
What a dream what a lie
When it sees everything in time
And yes dear I believed
It was my way of self deceiving
And now its getting late
And I’m passed all the grieving
Something inside of me breaks
When i get your phone call
And i just can’t hide
The big love has died
The big love has died
There is a love thats real i’ll always feel and that i can’t deny
But its the friend in me this time you see that has to say goodbye
Quietly you and me time to say goodbye
So yes dear I believed it was my way of self deceiving
And now its getting late and I’m passed all the grieving yeah
Nothing can take away the pain and the sorrow everything at stake
We just missed our time
The Big Love has died
