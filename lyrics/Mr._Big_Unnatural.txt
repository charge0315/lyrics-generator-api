UNNATURAL (Paul Gilbert)
Unnatural
Contractual
Piece of my heart
I signed away
For Magic beans
Grow into dreams
Open your eyes
They drift away
Unnaturally
This comes to me
Can't seem to find
Someone to be
It's laughable
Halfway or full
I give myself away
Aretha knows
Which way to go
Opens her heart
Blows me away
Led by a king
Told her to sing
So naturally
Her lucky day
Unnaturally
This comes to me
Can't seem to find
Someone to be
It's laughable
Halfway or full
I give myself away
Dumb luck
Gave her everything
She has
Dumb luck
Breeds jealousy
I'm stuck
In a body
With some hands convinced
I couldn't be
Couldn't be
Unnatural
Unnatural They drift away
Unnatural Blows me away
Unnatural
