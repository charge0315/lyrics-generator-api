Hold up
Hold on
Don't be scared
You'll never change what's been and gone
May your smile (May your smile)
Shine on (Shine on)
Don't be scared (Don't be scared)
Your destiny may keep you warm

'Cause all of the stars
Are fading away
Just try not to worry
You'll see them someday
Take what you need
And be on your way
And stop crying your heart out

Get up (Get up)
Come on (Come on)
Why're you scared? (I'm not scared)
You'll never change what's been and gone

'Cause all of the stars
Are fading away
Just try not to worry
You'll see them someday
Take what you need
And be on your way
And stop crying your heart out

'Cause all of the stars
Are fading away
Just try not to worry
You'll see them someday
Just take what you need
And be on your way
And stop crying your heart out

We're all of us stars
We're fading away
Just try not to worry
You'll see us someday
Just take what you need
And be on your way
And stop crying your heart out
Stop crying your heart out
Stop crying your heart out
Stop crying your heart out
