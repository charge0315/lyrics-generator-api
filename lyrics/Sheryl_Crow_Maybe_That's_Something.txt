We lay around just like gurus
In borrowed robes
And talk about nothing
Well, maybe that's something
Maybe that's something
Well, you stretch out across a long, long table
Without hesitation
You say, "I'm willing and able"

Maybe that's something
Maybe that's one thing more than I've seen
Maybe that's something more than nothing

You say good, I say you should, will you be there?
Making miracles is hard work
Most people give up before they happen

Maybe that's something
Maybe that's one thing more than I've seen
Maybe that's something more than nothing

More than nothing, more than nothing

Maybe that's something
Maybe that's one thing more than I've seen
Maybe that's something more than nothing

More than nothing, more than nothing, more than nothing
Nothing, nothing (Nothing)
