[Chorus: Jim Gilstrap &
Lani Groves
]
You are the sunshine of my life
That's why I'll always be around
You are the apple of my eyeForever, you'll stay in my heart

I feel like this is the beginning
Though I've loved you for a million years
And if I thought our love was ending
I'd find myself drowning in my own tears – ooh-woah-oh-oh!

Ohh, you are the sunshine of my life, yeah
That's why I'll always stay around – mm-mmm, yeah-yeah
You are the apple of my eye (Love has joined us...)
Forever, you'll stay in my heart (Let's love sweet love)

You must have known that I was lonely
Because you came to my rescue – ooh-ooh-ooh-ooo-ooooh...
And I know that this must be Heaven
How could so much love be inside of you? Ooh-woah-ooh-woah-oh

You are the sunshine of my life, yeah
That's why I'll always stay around – mm-mmm-mmm (Baby!)
You are the apple of my eye
(Love has joined us...)
(Let's love sweet love)
Forever, you'll stay in my heart (I've found my baby!)
You are my sunshine of my life, oh, yeah

Yeah...! You are my sunshine of my life
(Love has joined us...) Baby
(Let's love sweet love...)
That's why I'll always stay around (I've found my baby!)
Can't stop, hey baby...
You are the apple...
