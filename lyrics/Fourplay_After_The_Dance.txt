Dance with me
Come on dance with me, baby
Dance with me
Come on dance with me, baby
Dance with me
Come on dance with me, baby
Dance with me
Come on dance with me, baby
I want you-and you want me
So why don't we-
Get together after the dance
What a Freak!
When I first saw Miss. Fine
Lookin' good on the Soul Train
So good
I cannot get you sharp and right
You was dancin' good-spinnin' everywhere
I thought to myself
She was so fine
The ways she you moved
So fine
She's movin' so real, I need her
What she needs is me
I want you-and you want me
So why don't we-
Get together after the dance
While we danced
Let's break this baby
You were so fine
The way you moved me
Your warm eyes
Told me one thing
Oh baby, there was a vibe between you and me
That you needed my sweet lovin', baby
Nobody else's girl, nobody's love my baby
That's how'd I feel if I was you
I want you to take me with you
What'cha gonna do
I want you-and you want me
So why don't we-
Get together after the dance
Dance with me
Come on dance with me, baby
Dance with me
Come on dance with me, baby
Dance with me
Come on dance with me, baby
Dance with me
Come on dance with me, baby
I want you-and you want me
So why don't we-
