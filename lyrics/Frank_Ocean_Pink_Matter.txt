And the peaches and the mangos that you could sell for me

What do you think my brain is made for?
Is it just a container for the mind?
This great grey matter
Sensei replied, "What is your woman?
Is she just a container for the child?"
That soft pink matter

Cotton candy, Majin Buu, ooh, ooh, ooh
Close my eyes and fall into you, you, you
My God, she's giving me pleasure
Oh, no, no

What if the sky and the stars are for show?
And the aliens are watching live
From the purple matter?
Sensei went quiet, then violent
And we sparred until we both grew tired
Nothin' mattered

Cotton candy, Majin Buu, oh, oh, oh
Dim the lights and fall into you, you, you
My God, giving me pleasure
Pleasure, pleasure, pleasure
Pleasure over matter

Hey, hey

Since you been gone, I been having withdrawals
You were such a habit to call
I ain't myself at all, had to tell myself, "Nah
She better with some fella with a regular job"
I didn't wanna get her involved
By dinner, Mr. Benjamin was sittin' in awe
Hopped into my car, drove far
Far's too close, and I remember my memory's no sharp
Butter knife, what a life, anyway
I'm building y'all a clock, stop, what am I, Hemingway?
She had the kind of body that would probably intimidate
Any of 'em that were un-southern, not me, cousin
If models are made for modelin'
Thick girls are made for cuddlin'
Switch worlds and we can huddle then
Who needs another friend? I need to hold your hand
You'd need no other man, we'd flee to other lands

Grey matter
Blue used to be my favorite color
Now I ain't got no choice
Blue matter

You're good at being bad (Ooh, yeah)
You're bad at being good (Ah-ha, oh)
For heaven's sakes, go to hell (Ah-ha)
Knock, knock on wood, hey (Ah-ha-ah)
You're good at being bad (You're bad at being good)
You're bad at being good (For heaven's sakes, go to hell, knock on wood)
For heaven's sakes, go to hell (Would have ya)
Knock, knock, knock, knock on wood
Well, frankly, when that ocean so mu'fuckin' good
Make her swab the mu'fuckin' wood
Make her walk the mu'fuckin' plank
Make her rob a mu'fucking bank
With no mask on and a rusty revolver
