Huh! Yeah, boy!
I know this is kinda slimy
Feel it, you know what I'm saying
Big, big, a-big boy

You find yourself caught up in a silly game
(That's child's play) Don't play me out
The world depends on every little move we make
(It's serious) Cold serious

Now the time has come for all good to glow
And overthrow the bad
We're here to make a change, so all can be free
A call has been made, and we're back

We're back (Oh, we're back)
We're back to fight the evil
We will never deceive you (Oh, we're back)
We're back
We're back to fight the evil
We will never deceive you

Working hard to try to fight the evil plague, yeah
But a-don't you let nothing get in the way, yo

Now the time has come for all good to glow
And overthrow the bad, yo
We're here to make a change, so all can be free
A call has been made, and we're back

We're back (Oh, we're back)
We're back to fight the evil
We will never deceive you (Oh, we're back)
We're back (Yeah)
We're back to fight the evil
We will never deceive you (Oh, we're back)
We're back
We're back to fight the evil
We will never deceive you (Never deceive you)
We're back
Back to fight the evil
We will never deceive you

We're back, so start cuttin' up, 'cause ain't nothin' up
Pardon my expression, but, huh, you ain't tough enough
(We're back to fight the evil)
In fact, you're timid, weak, soft, illiterate
(We will never deceive you)
Call yourself a magician? I'm not gettin' it (We're back)
You're at the top of my list, you're most wanted
Back to take revenge for the people you've haunted and wanted
(We're back to fight the evil)
To be afraid of your tricks and games
(We will never deceive you)
But before you do that, remember our name (We're back)

We're back

Now the time has come for all good to glow
And overthrow the bad (We're back)
We're here to make a change, so all can be free
A call has been made, and we're back

We're back
Back to fight the evil (Evil)
We will never deceive you (Deceive you)
We're back
(And we're back) Back to fight the evil (Evil)
We will never deceive you (We will never)
We're back (No)
Back to fight the evil (No, no)
We will never deceive you (No)
We're back (No, no)

We're back to fight the evil
We will never deceive you

Back to fight the evil (Can we just cool it )
We will never deceive you (Now kick it, saying)
We're back (Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo)
Back to fight the evil (Yo, yo, yo, yo)
We will never deceive you (Yo, yo, what the?)
