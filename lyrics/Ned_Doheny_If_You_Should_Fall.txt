I don't care what your mama says
So what if love is blind?
If you should fall, give it your all
Ain't nothin' wrong with bein' strong
It doesn't hurt to try
It won't do at all if you should fall
It can change in an instant
Leave you hangin' by a heartbeat
If you're slow on the rebound
God help you if you fall in love
I'm up here workin' for the paper trade
I'm busy night and day
I'm always on call if you should fall
So if you're bound for glory
Better make your move
Don't let your moment pass
If you must fall, give it your all
It can change in an instant
Leave you hangin' by a heartbeat
If you're slow on the rebound
God help you if you fall in love
It can change in an instant
Leave you hangin' by a heartbeat
If you're slow on the rebound
God help you if you fall in love
'Cause it can change, it can change
It can change in an instant
It can change, it can change
It can change in an instant
Leave you hangin', leave you hangin'
Leave you hangin' by a heartbeat
Leave you hangin', leave you hangin'
Leave you hangin' by a heartbeat
Hey
You want it, you got it
You're on and go on, oh
Oh
Oh
Leave you hangin', oh
Leave you hangin'
Whoo
Hey, baby
Whoo
Hey, baby
Whoo
Hey, baby
Whoo
Hey, baby
Whoo
Hey, baby
Whoo
Hey, baby
