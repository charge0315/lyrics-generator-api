I am your joy, your best of joy
I am the moonlight, you are the spring
Our life's a sacred thing
You know I always will love you, I am forever

I am the one who came when you fell down (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
I was the only one around (The only one)
When things would hurt you
I am forever
Wasn't it I who said that you are free (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
When living seemed so hard to be
And things would hurt you?

I am forever (I am forever)
We are forever (We are forever)

I am your friend through thick and thin
We need each other, we'll never part
Our love is from the heart
We never say, "I don't need you"
We are forever

I am the one who said that you are free (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
When living seemed so hard to be (The only one)
And nothing would cheer you
I am forever
Wasn't it I who carried you around? (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
When all the walls came tumblin' down
When things would hurt you

I am forever (I am forever)
We are forever (We are forever)

You are the sun that lights up the sky
When things are shady, let come what may
We do get by
I was the only one around (Ooh-ooh-ooh, the only one)
When things would hurt you

We are forever (I am forever, alright)
We are forever (I am forever, uh-huh)
We are forever (Ah, what you do? What ya live for?)
We are forever (What you do? What ya live for? Our love is strong)
We are forever (Uh-huh, what you do? What ya live for? Uh-huh)
We are forever (Uh-huh, alright)
I am forever, I am forever (Ah, uh-huh, alright, ooh)
We are forever (Uh-huh, alright)
We are forever (Hee)
I am forever
I am forever
