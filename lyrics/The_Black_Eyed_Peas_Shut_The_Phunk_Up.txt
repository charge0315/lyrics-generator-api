Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Shut up, just shut up, shut up
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-ah-oh-oh

We try to take it slow
But we're still losin' control
And we try to make it work
But it still ends up the worst
And I'm crazy (Crazy)
For tryin' to be your lady?

Girl, me and you were just fine, y'know
We wined and dined, did them things
That couples do when in love, y'know
Walks on the beach and stuff, y'know
Things that lovers say and do
I love you, boo (I love you too)
I miss you a lot (I miss you even more)
That's why I flew you out when we was on tour
But some things just get out of hand
When you start screamin' for no reason
Just because I'm up in the club with my friends
Have a little trust and believe in your man
And just because I look at a girl, don't mean nothin'
And just 'cause we talk, don't mean that we
Word, so just shut up, shut up
Shut it up, just shut up, shut up

We try to take it slow
But we're still losin control
And we try to make it work
But it still ends up the worst
And I'm crazy (Crazy)
For tryin' to be your lady? (Why? Why? Why?)

Why does emotion gotta move so fast?
Love is progress if you can make it last
Why is it that you just lose control
Every time you agree on takin' it slow?
Why does it have to be so damn tough?
'Cause fools in lust could never get enough
Of love, showin’ the love that you be givin'
Changin' up your livin' for a lovin' transition
Girl, it's a mission tryin' to get you to listen
Screamin' at each other has become our tradition
You yell, I yell, everybody yells
Got neighbors across the street sayin’, "Who the hell?!"
Who the hell? What the hell's goin down?
Too much of the bickerin', kill it with the sound and

We try to take it slow
But we're still losin’ control
And we try to make it work
But it still ends up the worst
And I'm crazy (Crazy)
For tryin' to be your lady?

Don't even talk to me
Don't even speak to me
'Cause if you keep talkin', I'ma start walkin'
And you don't wanna see me leave
Well, if you'd start leavin', I'ma stop believin'
You ain't in love with me

Girl, our love is dyin'
Girl, our love is dyin'
Girl, our love is dyin'
Girl, our love is dyin'
Why did you stop tryin'?
Girl, our love is dyin'
Girl, our love is dyin'
Girl, our love is dyin'
Girl, our love is dyin'
Why did you stop tryin'?

Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Shut up, just shut up, shut up
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-ah-oah-oh
Shut it up, just shut up, shut up

Love is full of emotion and games
A thin line between good, bad, and insane
People goes through this just to obtain
A perfect relationship and maintain
But sometimes things just get out of hand
We all make mistakes, ain't no perfect human
Starts from a little lie on top of the other
Makin' up excuses to tie your loose ends
Then you wonder why things ain't never the same
Then you try to re-erase, but it's just too late to chase
Like chasin' a wonderful scene while I'm dreamin'
But when I wake up ain't nothin' but screamin'
Yellin', fightin', throwin' things at each other
Situations like this make me just wanna tell you to
Shut up, just shut up, shut up
Shut it up, just shut up, shut up

We try to take it slow
But we're still losin control
And we try to make it work
But it still ends up the worst
And I'm crazy (Crazy)
For tryin' to be your lady?
