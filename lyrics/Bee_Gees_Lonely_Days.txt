Good morning, mister sunshine
You brighten up my day
Come sit beside me in your way

I see you every morning
Outside the restaurants
The music plays so nonchalant
Ah-ah-ah

Lonely days, lonely nights
Where would I be without my woman?
Lonely days, lonely nights
Where would I be without my woman?
Lonely days, lonely nights
Where would I be without my woman?
Lonely days, lonely nights
Where would I be without my woman?

Lonely days, lonely nights
Where would I be without my woman?

Good morning, mister sunshine
You brighten up my day
Come sit beside me in your way
Ah-ah

Lonely days, lonely nights
Where would I be without my woman?
Lonely days (Lonely days)
Lonely nights (Lonely nights)
Where would I be without my woman?
(Lonely days, lonely nights) Yeah, yeah
Lonely days (Lonely days)
And Lonely nights (Lonely nights)
Where would I be without my woman?
(Lonely days, lonely nights)
Lonely days (Lonely days)
Lonely nights (Lonely nights)
Where would I be without my woman?
(Lonely days, lonely nights) Yeah, yeah
Lonely days (Lonely days)
Lonely nights (Lonely nights)
