Time goes by, I fall out of touch
I can't explain why I fall so much
I bought a pack of cigarettes
Sent an old Elvis stamp to your new address
The weather's here
Wish I was fine
Wish that you could read between the lines
You dream in colors
My night comes in black and blue
I'll send a postcard
Oh, how I wish that I were you
I am nothing, you are more
Than flesh and blood
A golden door
Let me come inside of you
Let me do the things I wanna do
Take me down to where you live
Take the things I cannot give
'Cause you dream in colors
My night comes in black and blue
I'll send a postcard
Oh, how I wish that I were you
(Bridge)
You are like the ocean
I'm a river that's run dry
If you cannot reach me
All my wild flowers they will die
Take me down to where you live
Take the things I cannot give
You dream in colors
My night comes in black and blue
I'll send a postcard
Oh, how I wish that I were you
