Uh, woo, you see
I go by the name of Kon the Louis Vuitton Don
I'm with my home girl (My baby, my baby)
Who need to hook me up with some of her home girls
(Don't matter what they say, baby)
Yeah (They just don't know my baby)
Janet Jackson (And how I feel about you)
We back, baby ('Cause you're so)

So many said we'd (Never)
Never know love like this (But)
They never felt your kiss (Felt your kiss)
And how good your touch can be (So)
Many a days, I face the pressure to walk away (Away)
From what the people say (People say)
But you mean so much to me, so

Baby (Baby), these butterflies, they never lie
Been through so much pain before and
Baby (Baby), I had to try
'Cause you're not like most guys
And I ain't ashamed to say that you're my (Baby)

Baby (Baby)
Don't matter what they say, baby (baby)
They just don't know my baby
And how I feel about you
Baby (Baby)
Don't matter what they say, baby (Baby)
I won't let go, my baby
And how I feel about you

When you look in my eyes
I wish you could read my mind (And)
(Ah-ah, don't it feel so good?)
And know how I feel inside (feel inside)
(Ah-ah, don't it feel so good?)
And hear what they say about you
(Ah-ah, don't it feel so good?)
Just because they can't see (See)
You're more than enough for me (Why?)
Why can't they just let us be (Can't they just let us be?)
And leave us alone?

Baby (Baby), these butterflies, they never lie
Been through so much pain before and
Baby (Baby), I had to try
'Cause you're not like most guys
And I ain't ashamed, that's why you are my (Baby)

Don't matter what they say, baby (Baby)
They just don't know my baby
And how I feel 'bout you, yeah (My baby)
Don't matter what they say, baby (Baby)
I won't let go, my baby
(There's more to his love than what y'all see)
And how I feel 'bout you
(And it don't describe what he is to me)
Baby, don't matter what they say, baby (Baby)
They just don't know my baby
(Y'all think y'all know what's best for me)
And how I feel 'bout you
(But y'all don't know a thing about my baby)
Don't matter what they say, baby (Baby)
I won't let go, my baby
(There's more to his love than what y'all see)

Uh, I go by the name Kanye Omari
And I wrote this just to say I'm sorry
I have foreign cars and houses
I have porno stars and spouses
You tryin' to stab one like Jack the Ripper
I was tryin' to stab two like Jack the Tripper
My nigga Tone been locked for a minute
He come home, he from the street
He gon' want him some strippers
And I'm a big tipper, I don't need to be trippin'
This my first real Rolex, it don't even be tickin'
This my first pair of earrings I can wear in the shower
Without them clouding up in half an hour
So that basically mean my paper gettin' mean
(Uh) Basically mean I'm into better things
I was an addict of cheating, but I stopped for sure
You an addict, you go with Janet Jackson, you cured

They just don't know my baby
(Y'all think y'all know what's best for me)
And how I feel 'bout you
(But y'all don't know a thing about my baby)
Don't matter what they say, baby (baby)
I won't let go, my baby
(There's more to his love than what y'all see)
And how I feel 'bout you
(And it don't describe what he is to me)
Baby, don't matter what they say, baby
They just don't know my baby
