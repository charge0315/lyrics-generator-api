And when the Lamb opened the first seal
I saw, I saw the first horse, the horseman held a bow
Now, when the Lamb opened the second seal
I saw, I saw the second horse, the horseman held a sword, oh

The leading horse is white, the second horse is red
The third one is a black, the last one is a green
The leading horse is white, the second horse is red
The third one is a black, the last one is a green

And when the Lamb opened the third seal
I saw, I saw the third horse, the horseman had a balance
Now, when the Lamb opened the fourth seal
I saw the fourth horse, the horseman was the pest

The leading horse is white, the second horse is red
The third one is a black, the last one is a green
The leading horse is white, the second horse is red
The third one is a black, the last one is a green
The leading horse is white, the second horse is red
The third one is a black, the last one is a green
The leading horse is white, the second horse is red
The third one is a black, the last one is a green
