Can I tell you shall I count the ways
Can I find the words that could explain
How my heart, my life, my soul you changed forever
You ease my pain with such a gentle hand
And when I´m with you I´m a better man
And I'll never ever understand the way
That you sing to me without music or words
The Sweetest melody that I've ever heard
When I look into your eyes
I hear a song that never dies
Cause you sing to me
Theres so much evil in the world today
Everybodies tryna to make a way
Looking for a peace of love to make it better
But we can make it through and rise above
With your little serenade of love
And I know that we'll be strong enough to
Go on and oh on and oh on
Cause you sing to me without music or words
Sweetest melody that I ve ever heard
Sweet enough to make me cry
Cause it keeps our love alive
Sing to me sing
And even through the fire
I know our love will find a way
And your the reason why gurl
I'm singing stronger everyday
You sing to me without music or words
The sweetest melody that I've ever heard
Cause when I look in to your eyes
I hear a song that never dies
Sing to me oh... sing baby
You sing to me without music or words
The sweetest melody (ooh the sweetest
Melody) that I ve ever heard
Sweet enough to make me cry (it makes me cry)
Cause it keeps our love alive
When you sing to me
You sing to me
Without music or word
The Sweetest melody that I've ever heard
Cause When I look in to your eyes (oh I
Look in your eyes)
I hear the song that never dies
( I can feel how much you love me baby
Cause you sing to me (everytime I
Look in to your eyes it´s like I can
Hear) you sing to me la la la la
Sing to me (I love you so much baby)
Sing to me (I love you so much baby)
Sing to me (I love you so much babe)
