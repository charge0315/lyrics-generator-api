Parkside is the place where niggas get laced
And we got mad taste and wash Jakes because they know
We like to floss a lot, the whips we got cost a lot
Plus it's too many niggas on the block to be just chilling
We make a killing right up under their noses
Fake clowns get wet down like hoses
Living lifestyles people dream about
And you ain't hardly seen this side until the steam come out
We got a lot of hippie cats with various personalities
But whеn it's on, we all in the same mind
Formеd to be a straight savage, running right through beef
And once we cook it up, it's too big in the streets
And plus the heat was stressing cuz we out 24-70
Under the impression, we making a mess
, it's all good, I got a legal deal
Get my dogs out the street, eating good meals
Tell you  license for the steel, now that's ill
Beside, I got a license to kill
But yo I still feel y'all don't understand it correctly
So must I bring it to the dome to impress your memory, yo

Parkside Gardens is the place to be
I start my day around the way chilling out with PSG
Parkside massacre until the break of dawn and
You cats better wake up and stop yawning
Parkside Gardens is the place to be
Doing my thing with PSG
Parkside massacre until the break of dawn and
You cats better wake up and stop yawning

 had a couple of casualties
 drastically
Youngest brother got stabbed, the oldest got blasted
To see him in a casket, I felt like I was hit up
Cold but stiff as a mannequin, he couldn't get up
The hunger and anger made me sit up and start to write this
Knowing that he's lifeless made me want to recite this
That's one of the million reasons that we vicious
Think beef is delicious, copped double sixes
We don't eat, we chomping, my dogs, we stomping
What you feel when you see a million Park niggas marching?
Ready to rip you head off, your deadline's dead off
The time is now, for you to pay or it's swept off
P stands for park, S stands for side, G stands for garden
Where the hell you gonna hide?
In the mix of terror, find action, you know I'll find you
Leave your ass dead on the ride when we never-mind you
Get hiding, tough gets going, we never quit
Most of my dogs is doing time as I spit
I got a trick for y'all cats when you get home
Plus album gonna be sitting on chrome, and you this, black
It's , set me up like that
I'm original,  fam, that's my physical
Y'all remember who, from the day to night
The Parkside massacre, yeah player, you got it right

We rolling up on the side
Made me mentally abused
Now I roll with cold potent, with nothing to lose
But the master cleaned all of my drama, we love honies
The dimes, the mellow honies, straight ghetto honies
I'm glad to meet ya, just popped the Moesha
Because this side love to twist back but never eat ya
You niggas asked if I dug the stoneface mask
And spending half the time hassling and drug trafficking
Not to be a bad role model like that
But if I got beef, this side come strapped with double gats
Coalition's like the commission, inconspicuous
I'm from where getting grants for 20's the best it gets
 never lasts, this side gets the cash
You try to creep on us, you better move fast
I'm from where niggas is humble, snatch your girl in front of you
Look at you eye to eye like "nigga, what do you wanna do?"
I'm from where they spit rounds
Bullets travel at the speed of sound
Guarantee the whole crowd hit the ground
The haters want to play then I show em the way
Cuz even on your best day, you couldn't flaunt with Andre
I'm nice with this, nigga, your life is priceless
Caught up in the mix of this Parkside crisis
Coalition niggas stay righteous
We recognize how unfortunate a short life is, yo
