You don't know, you don’t know
You don't know my troubled mind
Well, you don't know, you don’t know my mind
When you see me laughing
Well, I'm laughing just to keep from crying

The woman I love, and she's a part of me
Got my heart in trouble, down in misery

Well, you don't know, you don't know my mind
When you see me laughing
Well, I'm laughing just to keep from crying

Now, don't mistreat me 'cause I’m young and wild
You must remember you once was a child

Now, you don’t know, you don't know my mind
When you see me laughing
Well, I’m laughing just to keep from crying

Early in the morning, it looks like rain
Round the corner came a passenger train

Well, you don't know, you don't know my mind
When you see me laughing
Well, I'm laughing just to keep from crying

You don’t know
