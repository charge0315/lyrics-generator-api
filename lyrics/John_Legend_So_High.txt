Baby, since the day
You came into my life
You made me realize
That we were born to fly
You showed me everyday
New possibilities
You proved my fantasy
Of love could really be

Let's go to a place only lovers go
To a spot that we've never known
To the top of the clouds we're floating away, yeah

Ooh, this feels so crazy
And oh, this love is blazing
And, baby, we're so high
Walking on cloud 9

You've got me up so high (So high)
My shoes are scrapin' the sky (So high)
You've got me up so high (Oh)
My shoes are scrapin' the sky

Maybe later we
Could go up to the moon
Or sail among the stars
Before the night is through
And when morning comes
We'll see the sun is not so far
And we can't get much closer
To God than where we are

We'll go to a place only lovers go
To a spot that we've never known
To the top of the clouds we're floating away, yeah

Ooh, this feels so crazy
And oh, this love is blazing
And, baby, we're so high
Walking on cloud 9

You've got me up so high (So high)
My shoes are scrapin' the sky (So high)
You've got me up so high (Oh)
My shoes are scrapin' the sky

Ooh, yeah
Ooh, oh
Hey
Ooh, this feels so crazy
Oh, this love is blazing
Baby, we're so high
Walking on cloud 9
You've got me up so high
You've got me up so high
You've got me up so high
My shoes are scrapin' the sky
(You've got me up so high)
Yeah
Let's go to the moon, baby, ooh
Let's go to the moon, baby, yeah
Let's go, go
Let's go to the moon, baby
So high
