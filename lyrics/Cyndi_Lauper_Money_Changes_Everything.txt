I said, "I'm sorry, baby, I'm leaving you tonight
I found someone new, he's waiting in the car outside"
"Aw, honey, how could you do it?
We swore each other everlasting love"
I said, "Well, yeah, I know, but when we did
There was one thing we weren't thinking of, and that's money"

Money changes everything
I said money, money changes everything
We think we know what we're doing, that don't mean a thing
It's all in the past now, money changes everything

They shake your hand and they smile, and they buy you a drink
They say, "We'll be your friends, we'll stick with you 'til the end"
Ah, but everybody's only
Looking out for themselves
And you say, "Well, who can you trust?"
I'll tell you, it's just nobody else, it's money

Money changes everything
I said money, money changes everything
You think you know what you're doing, we don't pull the strings
It's all in the past now, money changes everything

Yeah, yeah, yeah, money, money changes everything
I said money, money changes everything
We think we know what we're doing, we don't know a thing
It's all in the past now, money changes everything

Hey, yeah, yeah
Money is everything, yes
Money changes everything, yeah
Money is everything
Money is everything, yes
Money changes everything, yeah, yeah
Money, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
