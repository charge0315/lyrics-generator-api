Okay, here we go!
One, two, one, two...
Writing you a letter
You said I'd better
Write a little more about me
I'm like grapefruit, peaches
Apples and oranges
There's quite a similarity
I'm juicy, yeah, baby
Come squeeze me, girl
Juicy
Don't tease me, girl
I think it comes to mind
Since the beginning of time
You and I were meant to be
Put your bottom down
Your love is a love
That I would surely like to keep
I'm juicy
(I just wanna love you, honey)
Come squeeze me, girl
(Ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah, child)
Juicy
Don't tease me, girl
I'm juicy
Come squeeze me, girl
Juicy
Don't tease me, girl
I'm juicy
Come squeeze me, girl
Juicy
Don't tease me, girl
I'm juicy
Come squeeze me, girl
Juicy
Don't tease me, girl
