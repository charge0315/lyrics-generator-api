If I never get to hold your hand
If I never get to be your man
That's okay, 'cause I've got other plans
Right now, right now, oh

If I never get to kiss your lips
If I never get to feel your hips close to me
That's okay, I ain't gonna trip
Not now, no how

'Cause I've got forever
Forever, oh
Eternity is just one kiss away
So they say

The opera, Jill Scott or the fair (fair)
Cyprus, if I never get to take you swimming there
If you never know how much I care, oh
I swear (I swear) Know what? It's not fair (Not fair)
No (No)

If I never get to make you laugh, ooh
If we never get to take a bubble bath
Y’see, I don't want to part with you, not tonight
If you gonna be a part of my past
I just won't, I just won't
Listen

I just want forever, oh
I just want forever
Eternity is just one kiss away
What'd you say?

Forever

So many things
We can do in the new world
I can be your future lover
You can be my future girl

If I never get to see your smile
Underneath the white veil, walking up the aisle
I just might go crazy, I might go wild
So let me tell you, baby
Stop looking at me like that
Unless you want me to bite that

Forever, you know what I'm talkin' 'bout
Forever
Eternity is just one kiss away
What you say?
Forever
Forever
A million tomorrows
Is better than one day
Forever

I don't want to kiss your lips
Until I get to your... hips
