Cool down, don't heat up that way
Every time we start it up
Then she'll say
"Don't take love so seriously
It's just what you see"
I don't want to push her hard
Circumstance making me play the part
It's more than just a game to me

When it feels right, don't stop the motor
Baby, keep it on
Let's work it all night, don't stop the motor
When it's running strong
Sparks fly, we create a flame
One more time, give your love again
Two hearts, forever beat the same
(Chorus)
Let's work it, let's work it
Let's work it, let's work it all night
Let's work it, let's work it
Let's work it, let's work it

My love is right for you tonight
I see the fire deep in your eyes
Got my key, if you believe
Just one spark and we will come alive
(Chorus)
Let's work it, let's work it
Let's work it, let's work it all night
Let's work it, let's work it
Let's work it, let's work it
