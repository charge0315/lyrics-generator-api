I gotta take
I wanna do all the day through
Slow love

You are all of me (You're all)
And all that you're showin' me
Is so beyond belief (It's beyond belief)
I'm livin' a dream (This is a dream)

Baby, take it to another level tonight (Yeah)
Express our lovin' in the nude, babe (Come on)
Baby, don't you realize that this is the time (This is this time, baby)
That I am yours and you will be all mine

Oh, I wanna tell you all I wanna do, do is
Huh-huh, all the day through and
Slow, slow, lovin' undercover
Take it up, nice and slow
Oh, I wanna tell you all I wanna do, do is
Huh huh, all the day through and
Slow, slow, loving undercover
Take it up, nice and slow

Freeze this moment, please (This moment)
Don't wanna get it out of my head (No)
Can't control the heat (I don't want to)
When our bodies meet

Baby, take it to another level tonight (Yeah)
So excited I'm beyond control (Come on)
Baby, don't you realize that this is the time (This is it)
Didn't you know it, didn't you know it?

Oh, I wanna tell you all I wanna do, do is
Huh-huh, all the day through and
Slow, slow, lovin' undercover
Take it up, nice and slow (Nice and slow, baby)
Oh, I wanna tell you all I wanna do, do is (Nice and slow)
Huh huh, all the day through and (Feel you all day)
Slow, slow, lovin' undercover
Take it up, nice and slow

(Oh, I wanna tell you) You're beyond belief
Is this a dream? (Oh, I wanna tell you)
Yeah, is it time, baby? This is it

Oh, I wanna tell you all I wanna do, do is
Huh-huh, all the day through and (Nice and slow, baby)
Slow, slow, lovin' undercover (Nice and slow)
Take it up, nice and slow
Oh, I wanna tell you all I wanna do, do is (All I wanna do)
Huh-huh, all the day through and
Slow, slow, lovin' undercover
Take it up, nice and slow
Oh, I wanna tell you all I wanna do, do is
Huh-huh, all the day through and (Nice and slow, baby)
Slow, slow, lovin' undercover (Nice and slow)
Take it up, nice and slow
Oh, I wanna tell you all I wanna do, do is
Huh-huh, all the day through and...
