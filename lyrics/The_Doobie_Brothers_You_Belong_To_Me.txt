Why'd you tell me this
While you look for my reaction
What do you need to know
Don't you know I'll always be the one
You don't have to prove to me you're beautiful to strangers
I've got lovin' eyes of my own

You belong to me
In this life
Anyone could tell
Any fool can see who you need
I know you all too well
You don't have to prove to me you're beautiful to strangers
I've got lovin' eyes, and I can tell
Tell him

(You belong to me)
Tell him you were foolin'
(You belong to me)
Oh, girl, you belong to me
(You belong to me)
Tell him he's a stranger
(You belong to me)
You belong to me, girl

Tell him
(You belong to me)
That you belong to me
(You belong to me)
Girl, girl
(You belong to me)
Tell him he's a stranger
(You belong to me)
Girl, that you were foolin'
(You belong to me)
Yeah
(You belong to me)
He's done
(You belong to me)
You belong to me
(You belong to me)
(You belong to me)
Tell him you were foolin'
(You belong to me)
Girl, you belong to me
(You belong to me)
