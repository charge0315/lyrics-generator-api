Got to have a belief in
Got to have a belief in
Got to have a belief in
All the people, cause the people are leaving
When the people believe in
When the people believe in
When the people believe in
All the children, cause the children are leaving

Belfast, Belfast
When the country rings the leaving bell, you're lost
Belfast, Belfast
When the hate you have for one another's passed
You can try (You can try)
You can try (You can try)
You can try to tell the world the reason why

It's the world that's deceiving

All the people, cause the people believe in
