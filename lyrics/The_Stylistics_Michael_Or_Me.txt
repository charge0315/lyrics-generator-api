Saw you once made it with somebody else
Well okay, so what's new
Don't you know baby
Yesterday doesn't count
There's only one thing that matters tonight
Tell me girl, tell me true
Who are you in love with
Here and now

Is it Michael or me
Me or Michael, you're thinking of
Michael or me, me or Michael
You said you were through with him
You said you were free

Is it Michael or me
Me or Michael, you love
Who will it be
Michaеl or me

We're into somеthing too precious to lose and too good
And too fine
So I don't wanna know about long ago
But if the shadow was messing your mind
Every time we make love
Baby, then you got to tell me so

Is it Michael or me
Me or Michael, you're thinking of
Michael or me, me or Michael
You said you were through with him
You said you were free

Is it Michael or me
Me or Michael, you love
Who will it be
Michael or me
Michael or me
Me or Michael, you love
Who will it be
Michael or me
Michael or me
Me or Michael, you love...
