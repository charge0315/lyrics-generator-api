Voiceover:
In recent times, there is no one at all who can approach
Antonio Gaudi. He started a new cathedral, in Barcelona
It is called La Sagrada Familia or the Holy Family...
The sad thing is they could try to finish it, but I don't
Think they will do it
Who knows where the road may lead us, only a fool would say
Who knows if we'll meet along the way
Follow the brightest star as far as the brave may dare
What will we find when we get there
La Sagrada Familia - we pray the storm will soon be over
La Sagrada Familia - for the lion and the lamb
Who knows where the winds may blow us, only a fool would say
Who knows if we'll ever reach the shore
Follow a rising sun with eyes that may only stare
What kind of fire will burn us there? What kind of fire?
Oh, only a fool would say
La Sagrada Familia - the wind has changed the storm is over
La Sagrada Familia - for the lion and the lamb
La Sagrada Familia - we thank the lord the danger's over
La Sagrada Familia - there's peace throughout the land
Under clear blue skies our voices rise in songs of glory
And for all those years our eyes and ears were filled with tears
Filled with tears
Who knows where the world may turn us, only a fool would say
Who knows what the fates may have in store
Follow the light of truth as far as our eyes can see
How should we know where that may be? (Where that may be)
How should we know? (How should we know)
Then the angry skies, the battle cries, the sounds of glory
And for all those years our eyes and ears were filled with tears
Filled with tears
Who knows where the road may lead us, only a fool would say
Who knows what's been lost along the way
Look for the promised land in all of the dreams we share
How will we know when we are there? (When we are there)
How will we know? (How will we know)
Only a fool would say
La Sagrada Familia the war is won the battle's over
La Sagrada Familia for the lion and the lamb
La Sagrada Familia we thank the lord the danger's over
La Sagrada Familia behold the mighty hand
La Sagrada Familia the night is gone the waiting's over
La Sagrada Familia there's peace throughout the land
Until the next time
Until the next time
La Sagrada Familia!
