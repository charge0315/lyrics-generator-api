Ebony and ivory
Live together in perfect harmony
Side by side on my piano keyboard
Oh Lord, why don't we?

We all know that people are the same wherever you go
There is good and bad in everyone
And we learn to live, we learn to give each other
What we need to survive together alive

Ebony and ivory
Live together in perfect harmony
Side by side on my piano keyboard
Oh Lord, why don't we?

Ebony, ivory
Living in perfect harmony
Ebony, ivory, ooh

We all know that people are the same wherever you go
There is good and bad (Mm, hmm) in everyone
We learn to live when we learn to give each other
What we need to survive together alive

Ebony and ivory
Live together in perfect harmony
Side by side on my piano keyboard
Oh Lord, why don't we?
Side by side on my piano keyboard
Oh Lord, why don't we?
Mm, hmm

Ebony, ivory
Living in perfect harmony
Ebony, ivory
Living in perfect harmony Ivory
Ebony, ivory Ebony
Living in perfect harmony Whoa-oh-oh, ivory
Ebony, ivory Ebony
Living in perfect harmony Whoa-oh, ivory
Ebony, ivory Ebony
Living in perfect harmony
Ebony, ivory
