Deeper I fall, and deeper still, deeper I fall, and deeper still
The way that you love me, I really can’t compare
And there’s no metaphor or simile, no analogy can take me there
There’s no way I can say it, at least not with words
You’re an ocean that fills up every line of this verse
I’m falling down, but it feels like flying
I hit the ground, but I won’t be cryin’
Can you imagine if we dived in underneath
Won’t you come and bathe in this ocean with me
Deeper than the fathoms to the ocean floor and deeper still
The way you love me
Deeper than the feelin’ that I knew before, and deeper still
Come on, I’m diggin it baby
The way that I see you, It’s always fresh in my mind
Round every corner than I turn around you’re the only face I find
There’s no way I would change this, it’s just what it’s supposed to be
You’re ocean that fills up every single inch of me
I’m falling down, but it feels like flying
I hit the ground, but I won’t be cryin’
Can you imagine if we dived in underneath
Won’t you come and bathe in this ocean with me
