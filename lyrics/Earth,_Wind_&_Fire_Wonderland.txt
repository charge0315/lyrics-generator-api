Come on in and enter as a child
Always wear a smile
Love and laughter here all the while
The flag of salvation waves around
Freedom here's abound
The joy in the sound
Calls my name on this day
I know my heart is free in wonderland
And it's all because of you, my Lord
And all my eyes can see in wonderland
Every day a sunny day
Leave behind your shame and your disgrace
Here they have no place
You will wear the garment of His grace
Rising sun will never set again
Sorrow's at its end
Every word that spoken shouts amen
Take me there
Chorus
Every day's a world of peace, peace
Flows like a river through me
