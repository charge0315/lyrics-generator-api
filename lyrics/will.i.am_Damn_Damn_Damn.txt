Damn, damn, damn
She got tops like a cantaloupe
And I just want her home, oh-oh
Damn, damn
She got eyes like their sparklin'
Sparklin' like diamonds

Girl you look so amazing
You got models to shame
You're sexy so serious
No time for playing games
You get me so excited
Hypnotized by your flame
If sexy was to leave us
You'd bring it back again
I love your new bras, angel
Your lipstick took their time
Most likely you ain't favorite
Nobody best in size
Girl it's your sexy features
I lost my mind when I saw you
When I saw you, I said

Damn, damn, damn
She got tops like a cantaloupe
And I just want her home, oh-oh
Damn, damn
She got body like an apple
And I just wanna bite it, oh-oh
Damn, damn
Oh my, my, my, my, my
My, my, my, my, oh-oh
Damn, damn
She got eyes like their sparklin'
Sparklin' like diamonds

Darlin' let's get this crackin'
We got no time to waste
I'm movin' on, it's lifted
Soon as my hands are ticked
Girl let me lay you down
And take your arm like a skyscraper
Girl I'll go in and out
And up and down like an elevator
Let me congratulate you
Cause you're always just too intense
Girl if I see you lift up
Maybe we can do it again
Cause it's your sexy features
That make me wanna spend some time
I lost my mind when I saw you
When I saw you, I said

Damn, damn, damn
She got tops like a cantaloupe
And I just want her home, oh-oh
Damn, damn
She got body like an apple
And I just wanna bite it, oh-oh
Damn, damn
Oh my, my, my, my, my
My, my, my, my, oh-oh
Damn, damn
She got eyes like their sparklin'
Sparklin' like diamonds

Oh-wee-oh
Oh-wee-oh
Oh-wee-oh
Oh-wee-oh

I met her backstage at the show-wee-oh
Lookin' fine, lookin' good to go-wee-oh
I took the girl to the disco-wee-oh
We went and did a thing on the flo-wee-oh
She a lady but she dancin' like ho-wee-oh
And I know that she know that we gon' (Ugh!)
That's why she like to top it real low-wee-oh
She know how to make a brother blow-wee-oh
I know she a professio-wee-oh
When it comes to the fellatio-wee-oh
She lickin' her lips real slo-wee-oh
She gorgeous from head to toe
God, I'm sayin'

Damn, damn, damn
She got tops like a cantaloupe
And I just want her home, oh-oh
Damn, damn
She got body like an apple
And I just wanna bite it, oh-oh
Damn, damn
Oh my, my, my, my, my
My, my, my, my, oh-oh
Damn, damn

I lost my mind when I saw you
When I saw you, I said

Damn, damn, damn
She got tops like a cantaloupe
And I just want her home, oh-oh
Damn, damn
She got body like an apple
And I just wanna bite it, oh-oh
Damn, damn
Oh my, my, my, my, my
My, my, my, my, oh-oh
Damn, damn

I lost my mind when I saw you
When I saw you
