At night, they would go walkin'
Till the breakin' of the day
The mornin' is for sleepin'
Through the dark streets, they go searchin'
To see God in their own way
Save the night-time for your weepin'
Your weepin'

Singin' la-la-la-la-la-la-lay
And the night over London lay

So we rode down to the river
Where Victorian ghosts pray
For their curses to be broken
We go wander 'neath the arches
Where the witches are, and they say
"There are ghost towns in the ocean"
The ocean

Singin' la-la-la-la-la-la-lay
And the night over London lay

God is in the houses
And God is in my head
And all the cemeteries of London
I see God come in my garden
But I don't know what he said
For my heart, it wasn't open
Not open

Singin' la-la-la-la-la-la-lay
And the night over London lay
Singin' la-la-la-la-la-la-lay
There's no light over London today
