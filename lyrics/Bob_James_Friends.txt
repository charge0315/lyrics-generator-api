It's so good that after all these years
That we can share something more than just tears
Someone like you should always be around
To lift up my spirits when they're falling down

It's very nice to have a friend, oh
Someone to talk to, some good time to spend
Someone to lean on when the road bends, oh
It's very nice to have a friend

Oh, you made my mind up
But you knew how I felt, oh
You know me better, girl, yes you do
Then I know myself
Oh, I'll never let you down
I'll pull you through

I need you, you need me
That's the way it should be
"Lady Oo, lovin' friend, I'll take that smile," you said

People say things that never come true
'Cause deep in their hearts, they're not thinking of you
You may be silent, but I know you care
'Cause wherever I am, girl, I know you'll be there

It's very nice to have a friend, oh
Someone to talk to, some good time to spend
Someone to lean on when the road bends, oh
It's very nice to have a friend

I need you, you need me
That's the way it should be
"Lady Oo, lovin' friend, I'll take that smile," you said

It's very nice to have a friend, oh
Somebody to talk to, some good time to spend
Someone to lean on when the road bends, oh
It's very nice to have one good friend

Oh, it's so nice to have a friend
(Oh, it's so nice) Oh, it's so nice
(To have a friend) To have a friend
(Oh, it's so nice, oh it's so nice)
Oh, it's so nice (To have a friend, to have a friend)
(Oh, it's so nice, oh it's so nice)
Oh, it's so nice (To have a friend)
