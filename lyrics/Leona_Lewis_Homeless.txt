Waiting here for you to call me
For you to tell me that everything's a big mistake
Waiting here in this rainfall, feeling so small
This dream was not suppose to break

I'm so sorry now for the pain I caused you
Won't you please forgive, please?

But you don't love me anymore
You don't want me anymore
And there's a sign on your door
No vacancies, just emptiness
Without your love, I'm homeless

In this cold, I'm walking aimless
Feeling helpless, without a shelter from the storm
And in my heart, I miss you so much
I'm missing your touch and the bed that used to be so warm

I'm so sorry now for the pain I caused you
Won't you please forgive, please?

But you don't love me anymore
You don't want me anymore
And there's a sign on your door
No vacancies, just emptiness
Without your love, I'm homeless

Oh, my baby, I'm sorry, sorry

But you don't love me anymore
You don't want me anymore
And there's a sign on your door
No vacancies, just emptiness
Without your love, I'm homeless
