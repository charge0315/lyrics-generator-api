(Yester-me, yester-you, yesterday)

What happened to the world we knew?
When we would dream and scheme
And while the time away?
Yester-me, yester-you, yesterday
Mm, yeah

Where did it go (Where did it go?), that yester-glow?
When we could feel
The wheel of life turn our way
Yester-me. yester-you, yesterday

I had a dream. so did you
Life was warm and love was true
Two kids who followed all the rules
Yester-fools, and now

Now it seems (Now it seems) those yester-dreams
Were just a cruel
And foolish game we used to play
Yester-me, yester-you, yesterday

When I recall what we had
I feel lost, I feel sad
With nothing but the memory of
Oh, yester-love, and now

Now it seems (Now it seems) those yester-dreams
Were just a cruel
And foolish game we had to play
Yester-me, yester-you, yesterday

Mmhmm, yester-me, yester-you, yesterday
Sing it with me
Yester-me. yester-you, yesterday
One more time, yeah
Yester-me, yester-you, yesterday
