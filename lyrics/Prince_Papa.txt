There was one September day that Papa worked too hard
First he crucified every dandelion out in the yard
Then he screamed at baby twice for throwing rocks at passing cars
Baby didn't listen, so like a priceless work of art
He got snatched by his Papa who then opened up the closet door
And pushed the four-year-old down, onto the closet floor
Baby cried "I'm sorry, I won't do it no more
Papa said "Yeah, I know, that's what this here's for"

Smack
Ooh Papa
Smack! Smack!
Ooh Papa, Papa
Smack
Ooh Papa
Smack! Smack
Ooh Papa, Papa

As the door closes, baby starts to cry
"Please don't lock me up again, without a reason why"
Papa just went outside and pointed a shotgun up in the sky
He said "How come I don't love my woman?"
Then he took aim and died

Boom!
Papa
Boom! Boom!
Papa, Papa
Boom!
Papa
Boom! Boom!
Papa, Papa

Don't abuse children, or else they turn out like me
Fair to partly crazy, deep down we're all the same
Every single one of us knows some kind of pain
In the middle of all that's crazy, this one fact still remains
If you love somebody, your life won't be in vain
And there's always a rainbow, at the end of every rain
