Tearin' me apart
Somehow I just don't care
She's playing with my heart
But Janet's so aware
And people tell me

She keeps tellin' you lies
I guess they wonder how I stand it
But when I look in her eyes
I know it's love the way I planned it
I believe in Janet

Janet
They don't understand it
The whole world must be wrong
Gave my heart to Janet
And she won't lead me on

There can never be
Another girl like Janet, no, no
It's only her and me
Together on this planet
And people tell me

She keeps tellin' you lies
I guess they wonder how I stand it
But when I look in her eyes
I know it's love the way I planned it
I believe in Janet

Janet
They don't understand it
The whole world must be wrong
Gave my heart to Janet
And she won't lead me on

Why can't they see
Without her there'd be
No reason to go on
As long as she stays with me
I'll keep holding on baby
I believe in Janet

Janet
They don't understand it
The whole world must be wrong
Gave my heart to Janet
And she won't lead me on
Janet
They don't understand it
The whole world must be wrong
Gave my heart to Janet
And she won't lead me on
Janet
They don't understand it
The whole world must be wrong
Gave my heart to Janet
And she won't lead me on
Janet
They don't understand it
