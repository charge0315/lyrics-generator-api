Everyone keeps telling me
I'm something I'm not
They fill me with questions
That tear me apart
But through it all
It was you who pulled me out
So please don't leave me now
Just give me one more night
To hold you
One more night
Give me one more night
To have you near
There's a man at the train stop
With tears in his eyes
It reminds me of so long ago
When I was able to cry
Now I'm strong
Slip away and laugh along
With anyone who needs someone blue
Just give me one more night
To hold you
One more night
Give me one more night
To have you near
What can I say
To make you stay?
I'd do anything
I'd give everything
To have just one more night...
