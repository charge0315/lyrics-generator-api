You lift me to the sky
When i'm flat on the ground
You put me on a high
When i'm all the way down
And when trouble comes around
Trying to blow up the spot
You look it in the eye and say "i think not"

Tell your heart i love you
I love you, yes i do
Tell your heart you need to
You need to know its true
Don't nobody in the world love you the way i do

You make me feel like a trillion bucks
You put a smile on my face
In a time i could be crying
And when negative comes around
With nothing good to say
You give it a stare that makes it get the hell away

Tell your heart i love you
I love you, yes i do
Tell your heart you need to
You need to know its true
Don't nobody in the world love you the way i do

Long before my mind believed
My heart could not help but conceive
That i love you, yeah
And when my head did suggest
My heart had already confessed
That i love you, love you, love you

Tell your heart i love you
I love you, yes i do
Tell your heart you need to
You need to know its true
Don't nobody in the world love you the way i do
