Everyday I'm haunted by memories
Can't erase them from my mind
And it's not like me to keep grieving
For a love that has died

So if you've really found another
At least won't you tell me why

What did I say
What did I do
When did your feelings
Change about me and you
Girl have a heart
And say it wasn't me
Who caused it to end
Just tell me something
'Cause look at the shape I'm in
Look at the shape I'm in

Don't know why I go through old photographs
When they only bring on the pain
Yes I'm searching for something to keep me
From going insane

So if you've really found another
At least won't you tell me why
 X2
What did I say
What did I do
When did your feelings
Change about me and you
Girl have a heart
And say it wasn't me
Who caused it to end
Just tell me something
'Cause look at the shape I'm in
Look at the shape I'm in

When did your feelings
Change about me and you
Look at the shape I'm in
