Never trust the stars when you're about to fall in love
Look for hidden signs or you'll begin to sigh
Never trust the moon when you're about to taste his kiss
He knows all the lines and lips so often lie
Just wait for a night
When the skies are all bare
Then see if you care
Never trust your dreams when you're about to fall in love
Or your dreams will quickly fall apart
So if you're smart, really smart
Only trust your heart

Never trust the stars when you're about to fall in love

Never trust the moon when you're about to taste his kiss
He knows all the lines and lips so often lie
Just wait for a night
When the skies are all bare
Then see if you care
Never trust your dreams when you're about to fall in love
Or your dreams will quickly fall apart
So if you're smart, really smart
Only trust your heart
