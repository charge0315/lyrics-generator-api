What a wonderful world
I see trees of green, red roses too
I see them bloom for me and you
And I think to myself, what a wonderful world
I see skies of blue, clouds of white
The bright blessed day, the dark sacred night
And I think to myself (Think to myself), what a wonderful world
The colours of the rainbow, so pretty in the sky
Are also on the faces of people passin'by
I see friends shakin'hands, sayin', "How do you do?"
They're really saying "I Love You"
I hear babies cryin', I watch them grow
They'll learn much more than I'll ever know
And I think to myself (Think to myself), what a wondеrful world
What a wonderful world
The colours of the rainbow, so prеtty in the sky
Are also on the faces of people passin' by
I see friends shakin'hands sayin', "How do you do?"
They're really saying, "I love you"
I hear babies crying I watch them grow
They'll learn much more than I'll ever know
And I think to myself (Think to myself), what a wonderful world
Such a wonderful world...
