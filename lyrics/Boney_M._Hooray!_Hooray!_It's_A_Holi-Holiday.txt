There's a place I know
Where we should go

Won't you take me there
Your lady fair
(Hi-de-hi-de-ho)
There's a brook nearby
The grass grows high
(Hi-de-hi-de-ho)
Where we both can hide
Side by side
(Hi-de-hi-de-ho)

There's a country fair
Not far from there
(Hi-de-hi-de-ho)
On a carousel
The ding-dong bell
(Hi-de-hi-de-ho)
On the loop di loop
We swing and swoop
(Hi-de-hi-de-ho)
And what else we'll do
Is up to you

Fun is the thing I'm after

Get set for love and laughter

Life is so full of sweet, sweet things
I'd like to do some tasting

In the countryside
We take a ride
Hi-de-hi-de-ho
Where the stars will shine
Lots of time
Hi-de-hi-de-ho
Back of your old car
We might get far
Hi-de-hi-de-ho
In the summer breeze
We feel at ease
Hi-de-hi-de-ho
