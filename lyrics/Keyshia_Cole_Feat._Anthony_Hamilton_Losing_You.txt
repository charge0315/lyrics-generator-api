If I said anything that I shouldn't have said
I'm sorry, sorry, yeah

It's been too long, baby, since you've been gone from me
And I miss your touch
'Cause no one could ever no, love me the way you do
Oh no, no, no

(Oh, and taking me away from you will be no damn good for me)
I need you in my life
No one could compare to you

I'm so confused
Don't know if I'm losing you (Don't know if I'm losing you, ooh)
I'm so confused (Oh)
Don't know if I'm losing you (Baby)

And there's no (There's no) way I (Way I) could ever (Ever)
Find someone real as you
Keep it true like you do
And I don't (I don't) wanna (Wanna) lose your love, oh
Over bein' hurt before
Bein' afraid before, no

(And taking me away from you, taking me away, will be no damn good for me)
I need you in my life
No one could compare to you

I'm so confused (I'm so confused)
Don't know if I'm losing you (Hey)
(And I don't wanna lose your love, baby)
I'm so confused (Baby, baby, baby, baby)
Don't know if I'm losing you (Please tell me you understand)

Baby, I know what you've been through
So I'm here to relieve you
Remind you
Renew you
Rebuild you
Girl, I'll do
Whatever it takes just to reshape what
What he messed up
'Cause real love needs real love
And I'm here love, 'cause I need you, oh-ooh

(And taking me away from you will be no damn good for me)
Said I need you in my life
No one could compare to you, oh

I'm so confused
Don't know if I'm losing you
(Don't be confused, girl, 'cause I would never leave you, baby)
I'm so confused
Don't know if I'm losing you
