There is something in the air
Woah, oh
There is something in the air
There is something in the air
Oh yeah

Deep within your mind you have been blind
Look around and find
There's something in the air
Sometimes I can read it in your eyes
Keep the dream alive
There's something in the air
There is something in the air, yeah, yeah
Oh yeah

Don't know why the truth becomes a lie
Makes me wanna cry
There's something in the air
So we're gonna dry the tears of pain
Wash away the rain
There's something in the air

And I can feel it, oh yeah
Oh, I can feel it everywhere

There is something in the air
Our tears will dry tomorrow
No more pain or sorrow
There's something in the air
There is something in the air
All the darkness turns to sunlight
Dawning hits the moonlight
There's something in the air
There is something in the air
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh yeah

We can heal the wounds of time together
It'll be forever
There's something in the air
I can feel the love that I desire
Come on, take me higher
There's something in the air

And I can feel it, oh yeah
And I can feel it everywhere

There is something in the air
Our tears will dry tomorrow
No more pain or sorrow
There's something in the air
There is something in the air
All the darkness turns to sunlight
Dawning hits the moonlight
There's something in the air

Something in the air
Is there something?
There is something in the air
Is there something?
Something in the air
Is there something?
There is something in the air

There is something in the air
Our tears will dry tomorrow
No more pain or sorrow
There's something in the air
There is something in the air
All the darkness turns to sunlight
Dawning hits the moonlight
There's something in the air

There is something in the air
There is something in the air
There is something in the air
There is something in the air
There is something in the air
There is something in the air
There is something in the air
There is something in the air
