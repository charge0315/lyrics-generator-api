Where has the time all gone to?
Haven't done half the things we want to
Oh well, we'll catch up some other time

This day was just a token
Too many words are still unspoken
Oh well, we'll catch up some other time

Just when the fun is starting
Comes the time for parting
But let's be glad for what we've had
And what's to come

There's so much more embracing
Still to be done but time is racing
Oh well, we'll catch up some other time

There's so much more embracing
Still to be done but time is racing
Oh well, we'll catch up some other time
