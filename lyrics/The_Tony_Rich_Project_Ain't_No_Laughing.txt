It's that time again
When memories arise
Of a certain song in my head
It makes me think of you
In a spooky mood
With a halo hanging over your head
With the angels you dance, you sing
You told me once before
Now why would you lie to me
When you could set my pain free
My daddy knocking on the door
Who says that I'm enjoying life?
'Cause people all around
But the one I found, can't be around
So I'm feelin' down
On that early morning
Hey hey hey hey hey
When I think of you
I find it being on special days
Hee hee hee hee hee
Ain't no laughing
No joyous times
When you're not here with me
Here I sit and stare into the cold air
At a cloud that pays me no mind
Knowing in my heart
That I'm trying to see you
In the bright blue sky, above Tuxedo right?
You'd never wear a suit
Just a sweater and a pair of slacks
And some nice shoes to match
Well, in the midst of them, my eyes are full
Cause I'm ready to cry
But I'm not afraid cause I'm a guy
Said I told myself
There's no use in waiting for you
In your precious car
But only God knows I'd give my all
To be with you on that early morning
Hey hey hey hey hey
When I think of you
I find it being on special days
Hee hee hee hee hee
Ain't no laughing
No joyous times
When you're not here with me
Hey hey hey hey hey
When I think of you
I find it being on special days
Hee hee hee hee hee
Ain't no laughing
No joyous times
When you're not here with me
