Ooo heh hey
Oh
What we’re living in
Let me tell ya
It's a wonder man can eat at all
When things are big that should be small
Who can tell
What magic spells
We’ll be doing for us
And I’m giving all my love to this world
Only to be told
I can’t see
I can’t breathe
No more will we be
And nothing’s going to change the way we live
’Cause we can always take but never give
And now that things are changing for the worse, see
Whoa
It’s a crazy world we’re living in
And I just can’t see that half of us immersed in sin is all we have to give these
Futures
Made of
Virtual insanity, now always
Seem to
Be governed by this love we have for, useless
Twisting
Of our new technology, oh now there is no sound
For we all live underground
And I’m thinking what a mess we’re in
Hard to know where to begin
If I could slip
The sickly ties that earthly man has made
And now every mother
Can choose the colour
Of her child
That’s not nature’s way
Well that’s what they said yesterday
There’s nothing left to do but pray
I think it’s time to find a new religion
Whoa, it’s so insane
To synthesize another strain
There’s something in these futures that we have to be told
Futures
Made of
Virtual insanity, now always
Seem to
Be governed by this love we have for useless
Twisting
Of our new technology, oh now there is no sound
For we all live underground, whoa
Now there is no sound
If we all live underground
And now it's virtual insanity
Forget your virtual reality
Oh
There's nothing so bad
As a man-made man
Oh, yeah
I know yeah
I know I can't go on
Ooh
Of this virtual insanity we're living in
Has got to change
Yeah
Things
Will never be the same
And I can't go on
Where we're living in
Oh
Oh, virtual insanity
Oh, this world
Has got to change
'Cause I just
I just can't keep going on in this virtual
Virtual insanity
That we're living in
Where we're living in
And that virtual insanity is what it is
Yeah
Ooh
Futures
Made of
Virtual insanity, now always
Seem to
Be governed by this love we have for useless
Twisting
Of our new technology, oh now there is no sound
For we all live underground, oh
Futures
Made of
Now virtual insanity
Now we all, we seem to be governed
By a love for this useless twisting
Of our new technology
And now there is no sound
For we all live underground
Yes we do
Oh
Now this life that we live in
It's all going wrong
Out of the window
Do you know
That
There is nothing worse than
A man-made man
I feel there's nothing worse than
A foolish man
Hey
Virtual insanity is what we're living in
Yeah
It is alright?
