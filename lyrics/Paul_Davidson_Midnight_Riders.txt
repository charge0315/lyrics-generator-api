I've got to run to keep from hiding
And I'm bound to keep on riding
And I've got one more silver dollar
Refrain: (2x)
And I ain't gonna let 'em catch me, no
Ain't gonna let 'em catch the Midnight Rider
I don't own the clothes I'm wearing
And the road goes on forever
I've got one more silver dollar
Refrain (2x)
Yes I've passed the point of caring
Some old bed I'll soon be sharing
I've got one more silver dollar
Refrain (4x)
