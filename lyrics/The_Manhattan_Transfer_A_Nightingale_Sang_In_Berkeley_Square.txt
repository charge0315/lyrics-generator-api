That certain night
The night we met
There was magic abroad in the air
There were angels dining at the Ritz
And a nightingale sang in Berkeley Square
I may be right
I may be wrong
But I'm perfectly willing to swear
That when you turned and smiled at me
A nightingale sang in Berkeley Square
The moon that lingered over London town
Poor puzzled moon
He wore a frown
Oh how could he know we two were so in love
The whole wide world was upside down
The streets of town were paved with stars
It was such a romantic affair
And as we kissed and said goodbye
A nightingale sang in Berkeley Square
A nightingale sang. A nightingale sang
The streets of town
Were paved with stars
It was such a romantic affair
And as we kissed and said goodbye
A nightingale sang in Berkeley Square
Oo-ooh
A nightingale sang in Berkeley Square
