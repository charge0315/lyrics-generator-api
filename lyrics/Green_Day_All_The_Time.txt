All the time, every time I need it
What's the time? I said the time is right
Here's to me, let's find another reason
Down the hatch, and a bad attitude, salud!

Wastin' time, wastin' time down a bumfuck road
And I don't know where the hell it'll go
Heirlooms, huffin' fumes, and I'm pickin' up the pace
And I'm gonna smash straight into a wall

All the time, New Year's resolutions
How soon that we forget
Doin' time, and lovin' every minute
Live it up on another let down, salud!

Promises, promises, it was all set in stone
Cross my heart, and I hope to die
Sugar fix, dirty tricks, and a trick question
Guess I shoulda read between the lines

Havin' the time of my life
Watchin' the clock tick
Havin' the time of my life
Watchin' the clock tick

All the time, where did all the time go?
It's too late to say goodnight
Time flies when you're havin' fun, yeah
Time's up when you work like a dog, salud!

Yeah...
