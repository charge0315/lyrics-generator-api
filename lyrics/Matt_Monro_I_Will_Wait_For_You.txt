If it takes forever, I will wait for you
For a thousand summers, I will wait for you
'Til you're back beside me
'Til I'm holding you
'Til I hear you sigh
Here, in my arms
Anywhere you wander, anywhere you go
Every day remember how I love you so
In your heart believe
What in my heart I know
That forevermore, I'll wait for you
The clock will tick away the hours, one-by-one
And then the time will come when all the waiting's done
The time when you return, find me here, and run
Straight to my waiting arms
If it takes forever, I will wait for you
For a thousand summers, I will wait for you
'Til you're here beside me
'Til I'm touching you
And forevermore, sharing your love
