I've never known a girl lovelier than you
If I did I would be lying and that I Wouldn't do
Come on have fun make my day tonight
Nothing really matters when you are in love
It's the only institution I'm not weary of
Don't be lonely make my day tonight
I know it, isn't easy to find romance
Know it can indeed, seem like you've no chance
When the land beneath you feels like no man's
Don't give up just persevere
Nothing in this world is ever certain
When your only love goes for a burton
Don't be too despondent just think positively
I've never known a girl lovelier than you
If I did I would be lying and that I wouldn't do
Come on have fun make my day
Don't be lonely make my day
I'm sure that you'll make my day tonight
I know it isn't easy to find romance
Know it can indeed seem like you're no chance
When the land beneath you feels like no mans
Don't give up just preserve
Nothing in this world is ever certain
When you're only love goes for a burton
Don't be too despondent there's more fish in the sea
I've never known a girl lovelier than you
If I did I would be lying and that I wouldn't do
Come on have fun make my day
Don't be lonely make my day
I'm sure that you'll make my day tonight
