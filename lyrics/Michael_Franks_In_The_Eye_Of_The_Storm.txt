You kill me with kindness
You call me "Your Highness"
But when I get blue
I can never find you
The circle keeps turning
The sky is still burning
I hear from my ex
On the back of my checks
But hold me awhile
And I'll hang up my guns, mama
I know I've been flyin'
Too near the sun
We'll move to the mountains
And make love to keep warm, mama
Like two little birds
In the eye of the storm
In the eye of the storm
This cloverleaf madness
Just fills me with sadness
We glide on these streams
Just postponing our dreams
The love that's inside us
How come it divides us
It just ain't like Cole Porter
It's just all too short-order
But hold me awhile
And I'll hang up my guns, mama
I know I've been flyin'
Too near the sun
We'll move to the mountains
And make love to keep warm, mama
Like two little birds
In the eye of the storm
In the eye of the storm
