It's not what you do, it's just the way that you do it
Makes me feel this way
It's not what I see, it's what I read into looks been giving me
Now make no mistakes (Make no mistakes)
I'm not sure I can take anymore of this waiting game
If I had my way (If I had my way)
I'd like to hear you say you kinda feel the same way, too

So when will you be mine? Do I have to wait forever?
When will you be mine? Do I have to wait forever? (Ever, ever, ever)

When will you be mine?
When will you be mine?
Oh, well, well

It's not what you think, but when you take a drink
I feel this invitation
There's no need to worry, 'cause I'm in no hurry
I just want that sensation
I don't look for trouble (Don't look for trouble)
Sometimes that trouble come looking for me, yeah
There's one thing that I wanna do (One thing that I want to do)
Is take you out of here with me

So, when will you be mine? Do I have to wait forever?
(I wanna know) When will you be mine? Do I have to wait forever?
(Ever, ever, ever)

When will you be mine? (Oh, I wanna know)
When will you be mine? (Uh)

When will you be mine? Do I have to wait forever?
(Do I have to wait now?)
When will you be mine? Do I have to wait forever?
When will you be mine?
(What's the problem? I've gotta know)
When will you be mine?
(Please don't you keep me in suspense this way)
When will you be mine?
(This waiting is killing me)
When will you be mine?
(I can't stand your drinking all night, the pain is from my head)
When will you be mine?
