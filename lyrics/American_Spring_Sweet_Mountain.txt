I'm looking up (what do you see?)
I see the sky (and tell me why)
I look and wonder (wonder 'bout why)
When will I see him? (tell me will I)
Standin' there
Standin' there
When will I see him?
In care of my, sweet mountain of love
Au bord de ma cher montagne d'amour
Au bord de ma cher montagne d'amour
I see the lightnin (what do you hear?)
I hear the thunder (what does it bring?)
It brings the rain (and if it pours?)
I'd want him closer
Standin' here
The mailman hands to me
A letter soaked with rain
In care of my, sweet mountain of love
Au bord de ma cher montagne d'amour
Au bord de ma cher montagne d'amour
I'm looking up (what do you see?)
I see a light (where does it shine?)
It shines for him (and does he know?)
I surely hope so
Shine for him
Shine for him
Keep lookin' up
In care of my, sweet mountain of love
(Rained on, rained on it rained)
In care of my, sweet mountain of love
(Well it rained on the mountain, the mountain of love)
In care of my, sweet mountain of love
(Well it rained on the mountain, the mountain of love)
In care of my, sweet mountain of love
(Rained on, rained on it rained)
In care of my, sweet mountain of love
(Rained on, rained on it rained)
(Rained on, rained on it rained)
(Rained on, rained on it rained)
