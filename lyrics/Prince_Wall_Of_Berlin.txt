Groove
Oh
Where am I?

Universe of paradoxical design
Reality of merely in the mind
In my head or in some German town
She said, "You want a four leaf clover in the ground?"
Ain't superstitious, and I don't believe in luck
But I heard the thunder before the lightning struck
I couldn't read the writing 'cause it was so small
But according to the document she got on the wall

She gets down like the wall of Berlin
I come 'round about a quarter to ten
We just met or at least we pretend
It's so fresh knocking down the wall of Berlin
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Ahh
Where am I?

Galaxy of monumental delight
Or parallel hologram copyright?
The call comes unexpected like a mugger in the park
And the sound of the train interrupts the question mark

Who you gonna be tonight, baby?
Wall of Berlin
A quarter to ten
Oh
Wall of Berlin
Come on
Uh, ahh
I like it
Who you gonna be tonight?

Is that the Queen of Sheba or an alien dream?
The marks on the table say somewhere in between
Not one for rituals, but one thing I have found
Everything's better when you come around

To get down like the wall of Berlin
I come 'round about a quarter to ten
We just met or, uh, at least we pretend
It's so fresh knocking down the wall of Berlin
Knock it, baby
Wall of Berlin
Wall of Berlin
Ow!
Wall of Berlin
On the one
