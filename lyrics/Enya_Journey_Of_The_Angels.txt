Somewhere in a winter night
The angels begin their flight
Dark skies with miles to go
No footsteps to be lost in snow

They fly to you
Oh, new-born king
They fly to you
Oh, angels sing

One is sorrow, one is peace
One will come to give you sleep
One is comfort, one is grief
One will take, the tears you weep

New star in a midnight sky
In heaven all the angels fly
Soft wings so true and all things
They will give to you

Somewhere in a winter night
The angels begin their flight

Tonight all sing
Oh, angels, a new-born king
Tonight all sing
Oh, angels, a new-born king
