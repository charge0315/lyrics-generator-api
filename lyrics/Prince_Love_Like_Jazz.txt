Hey baby, what's your name?
Do you wanna play a game?
Play it like we don't know when
We'll ever get to play again
Experimental, so brand new
The things I wanna do with you
Like a physical kind of blue
Come on, baby, let's get to it

I want a lover that can improvise
I need a lover that can make me cry
Yeah, uh huh, listen

Baby, I don't care what you
Learned in lovemaking school
You and me, we about to jam
Make love like the first woman and man
I don't want to know ahead of time
The notes you play should be a reaction to mine
Nothing planned or contrived
Then both of us will arrive... destination

I wanna feel like I've been hypnotized
If you think you can, then let's go for a ride
Let's go for a ride
Let's go

Do it to me, baby
Yeah
Now dig
Love like jazz
Love like jazz
Love like jazz
Love like jazz
