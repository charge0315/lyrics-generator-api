See if you can spot this one

What will you do when you get lonely
No one waiting by your side?
You've been running, hiding much too long
You know it's just your foolish pride

Layla
You've got me on my knees, Layla
You're begging, darling, please, Layla
Darling, won't you ease my worried mind?

Tried to give you consolation
Your old man had let you down
Like a fool, I fell in love with you
You turned my whole world upside down

Layla
You've got me on my knees, Layla
You're begging, darling, please, Layla
Darling, won't you ease my worried mind?

Make the best of the situation
Before I finally go insane
Please don’t say we'll never find a way
Tell me all my love's in vain

Layla
You've got me on my knees, Layla
You're begging, darling, please, Layla
Darling, won't you ease my worried mind?
(Yeah, yeah)

Layla
You've got me on my knees, Layla
You're begging, darling, please, Layla
Darling, won't you ease my worried mind?
(Yeah, yeah)

Layla
You've got me on my knees, Layla
You're begging, darling, please, Layla
Darling, won't you ease my worried mind?

Layla
You've got me on my knees, Layla
You're begging, darling, please, Layla
Darling, won't you ease my worried mind?

Thank you
