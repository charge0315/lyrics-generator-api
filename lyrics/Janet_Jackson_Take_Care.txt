Glass of wine, candlelight
Music made for quiet times
I'm feelin' mellow
I need my sweetie pie
Here to lay me out tonight
I want it, I want it but I can't get it

Take good care of me tonight
At home I'm so alone
I'm wishin' you were here
Baby, tonight my bed is cold
I'm wishin' you were near
'Cause I'm in a sexy mood
And only you can fill my needs
I'll lay here and take care of it
Till you come home to me

Always sound sensuous any time we pillow talk
Using such few words
I get sensitive when you work
It feels so good when it hurts
Always want more and more
And I know you can't be here
That usually don't faze me
I need you tonight
Boy, it's drivin' me crazy
Yearnin' inside with this burnin' desire
I want it, I want it but I just can't get it from you

Take good care of me tonight
At home I'm so alone
I'm wishin' you were here
Baby, tonight my bed is cold
I'm wishin' you were near
'Cause I'm in a sexy mood
And only you can fill my needs
I'll lay here and take care of it
Till you come home to me

Ah, ah, take care of me
Ah, ah, fulfill my needs
Ah ah, take care of me
Ah, ah, take care of me
Ah, ah, fulfill my needs
Ah, ah, whatever you can be
Ah, ah, I'll take good care of me

Take good care of me tonight
At home I'm so alone
I'm wishin' you were here
Baby, tonight my bed is cold
I'm wishin' you were near
'Cause I'm in a sexy mood
And only you can fill my needs
I'll lay here and take care of it
Till you come home to me
At home I'm so alone
I'm wishin' you were here
Baby, tonight my bed is cold
I'm wishin' you were near
'Cause I'm in a sexy mood
And only you can fill my needs
I'll lay here and take care of it
Till you come home to me

Ah, ah, take care of me
Ah, ah, fulfill my needs
Ah, ah, take care of me
Ah, ah, take care of me
Ah, ah, fulfill my needs
Ah, ah, whatever you can be
Ah, ah, I'll take care of me
