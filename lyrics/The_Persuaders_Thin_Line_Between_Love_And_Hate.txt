It's a thin line between love and hate
It's a thin line between love and hate

It's five o'clock in the morning
I'm just getting in, I knock on the door (Knock, knock, knock)
A voice sweet and low says (Who is it?)
She opened up the door and let me in (Let me in)
Never once does she say, where have you been?
She says (Are you hungry?)
Are you hungry, honey? Did you eat yet?
Let me hang up your coat
The woman tells me, pass me your hat
All the time she smiles, never raises her voice
It's five o'clock in the morning
And I don't give it a second thought

It's a thin line between love and hate
Don't think you can keep breakin' your woman's heart
It's a thin line between love and hate
An' she'll sit back an' enjoy it
It's a thin line between love and hate (Yes, it is, yes, it is)
(She gon' fool you one day)

The sweetest woman in the world
Can be the meanest woman in the world
If you make her that way, you keep on hurting her
She keeps being quiet
She might be holding something inside
That really really hurt you one day

Here I am laying in the hospital
Bandaged from feet to head
In a state of shock (That much)
Just that much from being dead
I didn't think my woman could do something like this to me
I didn't think she had the nerve, here I am
I guess action speaks louder than words

It's a thin line between love and hate
Don't think you can keep treatin' your woman bad
It's a thin line between love and hate
An' she won't ever get mad
It's a thin line between love and hate (Yes, is is)
She's gonna fool you one day
It's a thin line between love and hate
Every smilin' face ain't a happy one
