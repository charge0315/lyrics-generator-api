Oh, yeah
One, two, three, four

I never fell in love so easily
Where the four winds blow, I carry on
I'd like to take you where my spirit flies
Through the empty skies, we go alone
Never before having flown

Faster than lightning is this heart of mine
In the face of time, I carry on
I'd like to take you where my rainbow ends
Be my lover, friend, we'll go alone
Never before having flown

I am your hurricane, your fire in the sun
How long must I live in the air?
You are my paradise, my angel on the run
How long must I wait?
It's the dawn of the feeling that starts from the moment you're there

You'll never know what you have done for me
You've broken all those rules I live upon
And I'd like to take you to my Shangri-La
Neither here or far away from home
Never before having flown

I am your hurricane, your fire in the sun
How long must I live in the air?
You are my paradise, my angel on the run
How long must I wait?
It's the dawn of the feeling that starts from the moment you're there

I'd like to take you where my spirit flies
Through the empty skies, we go alone
Never before having flown
