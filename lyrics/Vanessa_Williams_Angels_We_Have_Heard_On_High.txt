There've been times when I thought I heard angels
And I must admit, it took me by surprise
I heard rhythm and the fullness of life
So rich, it brought tears to my eyes
There was a time, I was sure I heard angels
It was a sound tinged with sadness but loaded with the joy
Full of rhythm and, ooh, such music
Kind of a streetwise jubilation at the coming of that blessed boy
Angels we have heard on high
Sweetly singing o'er plains
And the mountains in reply
Echoing their joyous strain
Gloria, in excel sis deo
Gloria, in excel sis deo, oh
Shepherds, why this jubilee
Why your joyous strains prolong?
What the gladsome tidings be
Which inspire your heavenly song?
Gloria, in excel sis deo
Gloria, in excel sis deo, oh
Come to Bethlehem and see
Him whose birth the angels sing
Come adore on bended knee
Christ, the lord, the new born king
Gloria, in excel sis deo
Gloria, in excel sis deo, oh
Angels we have heard on high, oh
Angels we have heard on high
(Gloria)
Angels we have heard on high
(Gloria)
Angels we have heard on high
(Gloria)
Angels we have heard on high
(Gloria)
Angels we have heard
