Felt someone calling me into the howling of the wind
I heard the reflection of a sound
Echoing through my skin
And a distant drum rumbling under ground
Gently guides me on, through my wild heart
Whispering to me

The Sisters Of Avalon
Sisters Of Avalon
Sisters Of Avalon
Sisters Of Avalon

She is awakening in dark swells and mystery
Unbridled nightmares powerful and running free
You could still hear her cries reverberating through the trees
For the trampled flowers, the daughters of Eve

The Sisters Of Avalon
Sisters Of Avalon
Sisters Of Avalon
Sisters Of Avalon

They brought her in a new white dress
But the stain left an ache on her mother's breast
Now all that's left are the ghostly steps from a distant corridor

And a distant drum rumbling under ground
Gently guides me on, through my wild heart
Whispering to me

The Sisters Of Avalon
Sisters Of Avalon
Sisters Of Avalon
Sisters Of Avalon
