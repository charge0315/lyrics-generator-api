He's a victim of his own type
In his vintage suit and tie
He's a casualty dressed to the teeth
In the latest genocide
The new seasons come and go
At the dog and pony show
Gonna sit and beg and fetch the names
And he'll follow your dress codes
What's in a name? Hey!

She's a scented magazine
Lookin' sharp and livin' clean
Livin' well and dressed to kill
But she looks like hell to me
When you're dancin' through your wardrobe
Do the anorex-a-go-go
Cloaked with style for pedophiles
As your credit card explodes

Well, you auctioned off your life
For the most expensive price
Goin' once, goin' twice, it's gone

Alright, hey!

Woah-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh

Well, you auctioned off your life (
Goin' once
)
For the most expensive price (Twice, it's gone)
Goin' once, goin' twice, it's gone

Alright (Right!)

What's in a name? Hey!
What's in a name? Hey!
What's in a name?
