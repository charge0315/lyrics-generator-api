A rose in Harlem starts to bloom
The world is like a toy balloon
I hear a love song and I cry
And I know why

Because I love you, girl
Because I love you, girl

You know, there's nothing in the world
That I wouldn't do
Nothing in the world that I wouldn't do for you
Because I love you

If you should ask me for the moon
Of course, I'd show up with the moon
No matter what you ask, I'll try
And you know why

Because I love you, girl
Because I love you, girl

You know, there's nothing in the world
That I wouldn't do
Nothing in the world that I wouldn't do for you
Because I love you

Because I love you, girl
Because I love you, girl

You know, there's nothing in the world
That I wouldn't do
Nothing in the world that I wouldn't do for you
Because I love you
