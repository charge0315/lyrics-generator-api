I want you to touch me right here
I want you to wonder
I can take you over right here
I really just wonder
I want you to touch me right here
I want you to wonder
I can take you over right here
I really just wonder
Slide it from the side yeah
I just want to see you
Four am and I just got back to you
?
I don't even know you
But you still let me inside
Inside
I don't know why I feel why
I'm so into you I can't even try
There's just something bout the way you do me right
Is there nothing I can do to make you, make you mine?
Make you mine.....
I want you to touch me right here
I want you to wonder
I can take you over right here
I really just wonder
Slidin' slow, Take it slow x 4
Teach me how to slide
Slide it slow
All you have to do
Is stay right here
