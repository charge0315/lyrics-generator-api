Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

My mama told me that this could happen to me
That he would grow up and be the sexy man
But, oh, I just couldn't see
'Cause I didn't plan this alone, yeah, I was in my zone
And had the thought of us in my head
Somehow I turned this all off
And then I met him and he wasn't you
And then I dropped my head, thinking, what should I do?

Oh I, I loved you, and you loved me
And I just couldn't see tomorrow, baby
And I, cared for you, and I didn't see us through
Now I know in my heart you will always be the greatest ex ever
(Ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever)

Now I can do a simple thing like fall asleep
Oh, 'cause I can't close my eyes
Without a day with you in my dreams, dream
Sometimes I call your phone just to hear your tone
And I never say nothing, wait just like a couple of seconds
To hear you breathe and then I'm gone
But he's not like you
Can't help but to hold my head again, what did I do?

Oh, I, I, loved you, and you loved me
And I just couldn't see tomorrow, baby
And I, cared for you and I didn't see us through
Now I know in my heart you will always be the greatest ex ever
(Ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever)

And I know that it's all my fault, yeah (All my fault)
And it would be a lie if I said you didn't cross my mind at all (At all)
How do I erase my days? They're shaded in blue
All of my love's for you

Oh, I, I loved you, and you loved me
And I just couldn't see tomorrow, baby
And I, cared for you, and I didn't see us through
Now I know in my heart you will always be the greatest ex ever
(Ever, ever) The greatest ex ever, ever,  ever
The greatest ex ever, ever, ever
The greatest ex ever, ever, ever
The greatest ex ever, ever, ever
The greatest ex ever, ever, ever
The greatest ex ever, ever, ever
