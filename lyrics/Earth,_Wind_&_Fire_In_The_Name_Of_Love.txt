I woke up feeling good today
Gonna make good with the things I say, yeah, yeah
Never forgetting from where I come
All the people who I love
Gonna sing for the people (sing for the people)
In the name of love (name of love)
Let your voices ring
Gonna sing a little louder (sing a little louder)
In the name of love (name of love)
Let every heart sing (yeah)
Reminiscin' on what we've done
All around the world I'm speaking of
Just the good things we wanna focus on
All the bad, bad, bad will turn to stone
Gonna sing for the people (sing for the people)
In the name of love (name of love)
Let your voices ring
Gonna sing a little louder (sing a little louder)
In the name of love (name of love)
Let every heart sing
Gonna sing for the people (sing)
In the name of love (in the name of love)
Let your voices ring (yeah, yeah, ow)
We do it all in the name of love
We do it all in the name of love
Come on sing it now in the name of love
Come on keep it real (keep it real)
Oooh, we need to know how you feel
Come on, sing now if you feel the love
Get up and show if you feel it
Sing for the people (sing it for the people)
In the name of love (in the name of love)
Let your voices ring
Gonna sing a little louder (sing a little louder)
In the name of love (in the name of love)
Let every heart sing
