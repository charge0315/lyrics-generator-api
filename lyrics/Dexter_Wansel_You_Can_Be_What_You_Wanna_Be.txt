(?) yourself
Not for somebody else
Take a chance at life
You know what's wrong or right
Just what you have to give
Is everything you've got
So don't you be afraid
Just give it all you've got

You can be
What you want, want to be
You can be
What you want, want to be

In this world today
Who knows what's going down
All you can do is try
To turn it round and round
Just look into your mind
The answers are waiting there
And once you know the truth
You can go anywhere

You can be
What you want, want to be
You can be
What you want, want to be

You can be
What you want, want to be
You can be
What you want, want to be
