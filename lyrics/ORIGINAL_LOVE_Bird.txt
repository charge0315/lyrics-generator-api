One bird said to the other way up in the sky
"Do you see that child off younger"
The other said "Yeah, why?"
"I think the two of us are big enough
To take that child away, you know I've always wanted one."
So they flew on down to the boy that they had talked about
And they knew that it would be rough, but they had always wanted to raise a child in the wild
So they flapped their wings and lifted the kid up off the ground
And they took him to a nest which they'd recently found
They took him to the top of a big oak tree
And went to get somе worms so he could eat
But what they found in quitе some time is that the child had quite an appetite
So one bird said to the other "What will we do with our little bother?"
"I don't know. Can we just release him back into his element?"
"Well sure, but he'll no longer be our child in the wild."
Then the bird looked down to find another little kid
But before he could say a word the other bird just hid
He said "Hey, I wasn't thinking about taking another
But do you think that girl down there would like a brand new brother?"
So they flew on down tot he girl that they had talked about
And they knew that this was okay, 'cause they'd seen humans do it to birds every day
"I don't know. Can we just release him back into his element?"
"Well sure, but he'll no longer be our child in the wild."
