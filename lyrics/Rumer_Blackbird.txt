Warm as the sun
You were the one who outshone me
In the darkness everyone went away
You were the one who adored me
And it's so hard to say goodbye to you
So hard when I want to carry you
Everywhere, everywhere so I don't forget
I'll carry you everywhere, everywhere so I don't forget
But there's a blackbird singing
How long have you been hiding?
Lost in the rain
You always prayed we would find a way
We were watching old movies in
Our little technicolor hideaway
And on that soft screen
The beautiful ladies were movie queens
They'd glide on the floor
Singing melodies, melodies
That I can't forget
Oh love's sweetest reverie, melodies
That I can't forget
But there's a blackbird, singing
How long have you been hiding?
We've been through so much
We've been through everything together
We've been through so much
We've been through everything together
Now there's a blackbird singing
How long have you been hiding?
How long have you been hiding?
