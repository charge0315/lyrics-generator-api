I'm going back, I'm going back

I'm going back to country living
Where the air is fresh and clean
Going back to natural living
Where the grass grows tall and green
And the sky can be seen
(I'm going back, I'm going back)
I said goodbye to New York City
City life is not for me
Going where the stars shine nightly
And the sound of nature's voice
Lulls you to sleep
(I'm going back)

There's room enough for birds to fly
Time enough to try all the things you want to do
Country life, I'm with you
(I'm going back, I'm going back)
(I'm going back, I'm going back)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Going back to country living
That's where I was meant to be
Gonna to take life nice and easy
Country bound to my old hometown
Gonna live as I please
(I'm going back, I'm going back)

There's room enough for birds to fly
Time enough to try all the things you want to do
Country life I'm with you
(I'm going back, I'm going back)
(I'm going back, I'm going back)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
 X3
There's room enough for birds to fly
Time enough to try all the things you want to do
Country life I'm with you
(I'm going back, I'm going back)
