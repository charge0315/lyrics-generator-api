Serious, serious
Awwwwwwwwh, baaaby
Awwwwwh, baby...

Bear-skin rug, fireplace
I rub my fingers all over your face
Kiss and hug, a lovely taste
Close your eyes, drift into space
Secrets learned, secrets to keep
With one concern, we have no time for sleep
Emotions overflow, shouldn’t be denied
Cling to me for the magic ride

Intimate connection, baby (serious)
Oh baby, oh baby
Intimate connection, baby (serious)
Oh baby...

Relax my love; spread your wings for the flight
We’ll take a pleasure cruise all through the night
Intoxicated with so much affection
Spontaneity; the only direction
Put your trust in me, have no fear
Soon that special moment will be here
I’m gonna take you where you’ve never been before
I’ll be the key; you be the door

Intimate connection, baby (serious)
Oh, baby
Intimate connection, baby (serious)
Ohh, my baby...

Ohhhh… dawn decorates a night of ecstasy
A breakfast menu of you and me
No experience will ever be so sweet
I can’t wait till we repeat

Intimate connection, baby (serious)
Oh, baby
Intimate connection, baby (serious)
Oh, baby
Intimate connection, baby (serious)
Oh baby, oh baby, oh baby

Intimate connection, baby (serious)
Oh... my baby
Intimate connection, baby (serious)
Oh, baby
Intimate connection, baby (serious)
Oh, ho... my baby
Intimate connection, baby (serious)
Oh, baby...
