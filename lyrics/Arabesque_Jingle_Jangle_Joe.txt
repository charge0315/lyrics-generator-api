Written by Jean Frankfurter (Music)
I was four and you were five
You said to me "You will be my wife"
Remember ?
What did you play on your first guitar
Just for me, back in Barney's Bar
Remember ?
Remember ?
* Jingle Jangle Joe
That is long ago
Jingle Jangle Joe
You're a star I know
You sing your songs around the world
You can have a million girls
Tell me
Jingle Jangle Joe
Once you loved me so
Why don't you know me any more
Jingle Jangle Joe
Once you loved me so
Why don't you know me any more
Jingle Jangle Joe
Once you loved me so
Why don't you know me any more
I had a bound this talent-show
I said: "Why don't you try it, Joe"
Remember ?
So overnight you became a star
And I'm still working in Barney's Bar
Remember ?
Remember ?
* (Repeat)
Jingle Jangle Joe
Once you loved me so
Why don't you know me any more
