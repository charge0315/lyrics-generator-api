Only you, babe (You, babe)
Only you, babe (You, babe)
Only you, babe
Only you, babe (You babe)
Only you, babe (You babe)
Only you, babe

Sometimes I get a little lonely
(Lonely, lonely) I'm lonely for you, girl
All my body pains, only need for the good things
All the making love and breaking bread
Face to face, get down with the love most inner place
With only you, babe (You babe)
Oh, all this love can be replaced
I pick up love, upon your face
I kiss your lips, my body breaks
You lift me up, and turn me around
You can appreciate; this good love can't go down

Only you, babe (You, babe)
Only you, babe (You, babe)
Only you, baby
Only you, babe (You, babe)
Only you, baby
Only you, babe (You, babe)
Only you, baby

People don't understand
Misled with there intents
Think they can get along with anyone
Who gives sweet, sweet, sweet company
My baby without trying
Never is denying
So down with the satisfying
Always gratifying
Nothing can go wrong
This love can carry on
So happy sad, you left me sad
So we did try, you make me cry
Oh, you don't know, you've grown a part of me
Good, good feelings, giving tenderly

Wooo hoo hoo
Pick me up baby
Wooo hoo hoo
Pick me up, baby
Only you, babe (You, babe)
Only you, babe (You, babe)
Only you, baby (You, babe)
Only you, baby
Only you, babe (You, babe)
Only you, babe (You, babe)
Only you, baby
Only you, only you, only you, baby (You, babe)
