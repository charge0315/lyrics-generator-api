As sure as cherries were made for eating
And fish were made to swim in the sea
You were made to be loved a lot by nobody else but me
By nobody else but me
By nobody else but me

I see in your eyes where tomorrow is hiding
In my heart, there's a bell ringing loud
At the touch of your lips
Down the rainbow I'm sliding, little arrows keep falling
As thick as a cloud

As sure as cherries were madе for eating
And fish were madе to swim in the sea
You were made to be loved a lot by nobody else but me
By nobody else but me
By nobody else but me

Each time you appear, I hear nightingales singing
Like as loud as a rock 'n' roll band
They're delighted I'm bringing a box with a ring
It's a solitaire diamond designed for your hand

For as sure as cherries were made for eating
And fish were made to swim in the sea
You were made to be loved a lot by nobody else but me
By nobody else but me
By nobody else but me
As sure as cherries were made for eating
And fish were made to swim in the sea
You were made to be loved a lot by nobody else but me (Ooh)
By nobody else but me (Ooh)
By nobody else but me (Me)
