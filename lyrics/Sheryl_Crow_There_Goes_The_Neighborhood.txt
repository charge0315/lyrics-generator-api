Hey, let's party
Let's get down
Let's turn the radio on
This is the meltdown
Get out the camera
Take a picture
The drag queens and the freaks
Are all out on the town
And cowboy Jane's in bed
Nursing a swollen head

Sunshine Sally and Peter Ustinov
Don't like the scene anyhow
I dropped acid on a Saturday night
Just to see what the fuss was about
Now there goes the neighborhood

The photo chick made to look sickly
Is standing in her panties in the shower
She plays the guitar in the bathroom
While the police dust her mother's plastic flowers
And Schoolboy John's in jail
Makin' a killin' through the U.S. mail

Sunshine Sally and Peter Ustinov
Don't like the scene anyhow
I dropped acid on a Saturday night
Just to see what the fuss was about
Now there goes the neighborhood
Neighborhood
Now there goes the neighborhood

This is the movie of the screenplay
Of the book about a girl who meets a junkie
The messenger gets shot down
Just for carryin' the message to a flunkie
We can't be certain who the villains are 'cause everyone's so pretty
But the afterparty's sure to be a wing-ding as it moves into your
City (Oh)

Sunshine Sally and Peter Ustinov
Don't like the scene anyhow
I dropped acid on a Saturday night
Just to see what the stink was about
Sunshine Sally and Peter Ustinov
Don't like the scene anyhow
I dropped acid on a Saturday night
Just to see what the fuss was about
Now there goes the neighborhood
Hood
Now there goes the neighborhood
