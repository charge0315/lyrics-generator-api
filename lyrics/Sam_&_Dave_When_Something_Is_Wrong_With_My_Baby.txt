When something is wrong with my baby
Something is wrong with me
And if I know she's worried
Then I would feel that same misery

We've been through so much together
But we stand as one and that's what makes it better

When something is wrong with my baby
Something is wrong with me
Now listen

Just what, uh-huh, she means to me now
Oh, you just wouldn't, you just wouldn't understand
People can say, ha, she's no good
But oh, she's my woman, and I know I'm her man

And if she's got a problem
Oh, oh, I know, I know I got to help her solve 'em

When something is wrong with my baby (Sho'nuff)
Something is wrong with me

Now, say that again
When something is wrong with my baby (Oh, baby)
Something is wrong with me (Oh, hey, yeah)
