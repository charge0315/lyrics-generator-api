(Come on, Let's get a blast done !)
The wheels' tires of my car were smokin'
When I got started
I was drivin' through the darkness of the night at whole (wow !)
A cheap thrill, an emotion started takin' on me
I was still frightened for the days to come
It's your pain, or my pain or somebody's pain
Doesn't matter if I can live for the girlfriend I love
It's your dream or my dream or somebody's dream
I will not have fear any more
Get wild and tough, believe me, my girl
I'm the man who holds the part of love you can't hold alone
Get wild and tough, don't want to be a friend
I don't want to get through and find the message just in this town
Get chance and luck, don't worry, my friend
If you find a place where you can saved that must be somewhere/someone
Get chance and luck, I need you, my girl
I will find my broken dream if I must do by
Myself
She was throwin' a big kiss on the light of the car
She was dancin'/sensin' in the middle of the street
On the black stage of the cold night sky
I could see the girl
She was jokin', she was kiddin' but was more sad
It's your pain, or my pain or somebody's pain
Doesn't matter if I can live for the girlfriend I love
It's your dream or my dream or somebody's dream
I know, I can be so strong
Get wild and tough, believe me, my girl
I'm the man who holds the pain of love you can't heal alone
Get wild and tough, don't want to be slave
I don't want to waste and lose my freedom just in this town
Get chance and luck, don't worry, my friend
You can find a place where you can saved
You don't need to be afraid
Get chance and luck, I need you, my girl
I will find my broken dream if I must do by myself
