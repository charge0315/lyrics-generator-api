And I guess I've got to start
Guess I've got to start all over again
Well, the moment has arrived
For us to part
But there's a very heavy load (A very heavy load)
Upon my heart
'Cause I don't wanna do it (I don't wanna do it)
'Cause I'm not used to it ('Cause I'm not used to it)
Oh, darling, I'm gonna do the best I can
Girl, I'm only a man
And I guess I've got to start
Guess I've got to start all over again, oh
Guess I've got to start all over again
I said I better make a note of this
I feel I'm gonna miss your kiss
And, you better hurry up and run to him
For you're so hard to resist, my love
And you wanna know what I'm gonna do
Well, darling, I'm gonna do the best I can
Girl, I'm only a man
And I guess I've got to start
Guess I've got to start, all over again, oh
Guess I've got to start all over again
I find it hard to get along without you
But I'm gonna do the best I can
Say you wanna know, what I'm gonna do
Well, darling, I'm gonna do the best I can
Girl, I'm only a man
I said I guess I've got to start
Guess I've got to start all over again, oh
Said I guess I've got to start all over again
Guess I've got to start
Guess I've got to start all over again
Guess I've got to start
Guess I've got to start all over again
Guess I've got to start
Guess I've got to start all over again, oh
Guess I've got to start all over again
Guess I've got to start all over again
'Cause we've got find a way to bring some loving home too (Guess I've got to start all over again)
We've got find a way to bring some loving home too (Guess I've got to start all over again)
We've got find a way to bring some loving home too (Guess I've got to start all over again)
We've got find a way to bring some loving home too (Guess I've got to start all over again)
We've got find a way to bring some loving home too (Guess I've got to start all over again)
We've got find a way to bring some loving home too (Guess I've got to start all over again)
We've got find a way to bring some loving home too (Guess I've got to start all over again)
