My first, my last, my everything
And the answer to all my dreams
You're my sun, my moon, my guiding star
My kind of wonderful, that's what you are
I know there's only, only one like you
There's no way, they could have made two
You're all I'm living for
Your love I'll keep for evermore
You're the first, you're the last, my everything
In you I've found so many things
A love so new only you could bring
Can't you see if you
You'll make me feel this way
You're like a first morning dew on a brand new day
I see so many way that I can love you
Till the day I die
You're my reality, yet I'm lost in a dream
You're the first, the last, my everything
I know there's only, only one like you
There's no way they could have made two
Girl you're my reality
But I'm lost in a dream
You're the first, you're the last, my everything
