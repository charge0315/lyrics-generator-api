What's wrong with my mind
What's come over me
I thought I saw your face
Wearing a smile, dimple on the side

What's come over me
(What's come over me)
What's come over me
(What's come over me)

What's wrong with my ears
They're deceiving me
I thought I heard you speak
Calling my name, I must be insane, I just can't explain

What's come over me
(What's come over me)
What's come over me
(What's come over me)
Don't tell me I've stumbled upon you
Or is my mind in a daze
For this can't be as real as I want it
For you let me go, then went away
Some kind of feelin'
(What's come over me)
Just look at me now, seems like I'm floating on a cloud
Oh, what could this be

What's come over me
(What's come over me, over me, come over me)
What's come over me
(Over me)
Over and over, baby
(What's come over me)
What's come over me
What's come over me
(Over me, come over me, over me)
(Ah...ah...)

You see, I must have gone through some changes when I kissed your picture
And hey, my mind just keeps on wondering when you only left me yesterday
I've never been to heaven, instead I spent the night with you
Maybe that's the reason I don't know what to do
What's come over me

What's come over me
(Over me, come over me, over me)
What's come over me
Over and over, baby
(What's come over me, over me, over me)
And I can't break free
What's come over me
Over and over and over and I just can't sleep
(What's come over me, over me, came over me, over me)
Tell me, tell me what's come over and over, baby
(What's come over me, over me, over me)
