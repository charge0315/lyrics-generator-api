Last night I tried a little Adderall
It was working for a while
Until I thought about your smile
I got that fire cali medical
But it never gets me high
Baby only you know why
Cause darling

You, you are
My designer drug
And only you
Can help me
And I can't get enough
You, you are
My designer drug
And only you (only you)
Can help me (you can help me)
And I can't get enough

I sip that ginger ale and Hennessy
But every drink inside my glass
Just makes me think about the past
I tried that MDMA ecstasy
And it only brought me down
But know whenever you're around
I know that

You, you are
My designer drug
And only you
Can help me
And I can't get enough
You, you are
My designer drug
And only you (only you)
Can help me (you can help me)
And I can't get enough

It's like you're made inside a laboratory
Just for me
It's like you're made inside a laboratory
Just for me
It's like you're made inside a laboratory
Just for me
It's like you're made inside a laboratory
Just for me
Ooooh girl the only one I was is

You, you are
My designer drug
And only you
Can help me
And I can't get enough
You, you are
My designer drug
And only you (only you)
Can help me (you can help me)
And I can't get enough

Only you, you can help me
Only you, you can help me
Only you, you can help me
