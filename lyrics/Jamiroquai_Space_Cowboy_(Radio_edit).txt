Everything is good and brown
Oh I'm here again
With a sunshine smile upon my face
My friends are close at hand
And all my inhibitions
Have disappeared without a trace
I'm glad, oh I found
Somebody who I can rely on
This is the return of the space cowboy
Inter-planetary good vibe zone
Say at the speed of Cheeba, oh you and I go deeper
Maybe I'll have to get high to get by, hey
Everything is good oh and green
Say I'm red again
And I don't suppose I'm comin' down
I can see clearly, so high in sky
A man with psychedelic picture frames
Of happiness to shade his eyes
He's glad, oh that he found
Somebody who he can rely on
This is the return of the space cowboy
Inter-planetary good vibe zone
Say at the speed of Cheeba, oh you and I'll go deeper
And now maybe I'll have to get high to get by, hey
Maybe I'm gonna have to get high
Hey maybe I'm gonna have to get high
Hey, so high yeah
So high yeah, you and I
Now this is the return of the space cowboy
Oh inter-planetary good vibe zone
Getting high, oh getting high
Oh, this is the return of the space cowboy
Inter-planetary good vibe zone
This is the return of the space cowboy
Inter-planetary good vibe zone
Say at the speed of Cheeba, oh you and I'll go deeper
Hey now we'll go deeper, oh now we'll go deeper
You and I, you and I, you and I, you and I
