The miles go by
Like water under the bridge
Reach for tomorrow
With the new sunrise
The road before us
Leading to what we need
Right from the start
Follow your hearts
Giving more than we receive
Because in this country
Our hearts are open
We are free to try again
When we see
What will be
Again we believe
A travel on an open road
To the future today
A restless heart
Knows when he's ready to go
The never-ending miles unfold
As far as I can see
Right from the start
Follow your heart
No matter where the path may lead
Because in this country
Our hearts are open
We are free to fly again
When we see
What will be
Again we believe
You know the road is to tomorrow
Will you ride along with me again ?
Give my life for yours
If you only say the word
From the past to the new
Giving more than you receive
Because in this country...
