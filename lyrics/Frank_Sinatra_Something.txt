Something in the way she moves, attracts me like no other lover
Something in the way she woos me, I don't wanna leave her now
You know I believe in how.....
Somewhere in her smile she knows, that I don't need no other lover
Something in her style that shows me. I don't wanna leave her now
You know I believe in how.....
You're askin' me will my love grow, I don't know, I don't know?
Just stick around now, it may show. I don't know, I don't know?
Something in the way she knows, and all I have to do is think of her
Something in the things she shows me. I don't wanna leave her now
You know I believe in how.....
You're askin me will my love grow. I don't know, no I don't know?
You stick around now, it may show. I don't know, I don't know?
Something in the way she knows me, and all I have to do is just think
Of her. Something in the things she shows me. I don't wanna leave her
Now. You know I believe in how.....
Don't want to leave her now.....
