Put your hands together
No, like this
Surprise, surprise
Another treat, another trick
This is sweet, which one's which?

For the record let me state
That I never had a reason to break contractual endeavor
Or sever relationship with anyone I'd pleasure (Pleasure)
For the playa, let me stop and say-ah
That I only payed attention when I heard you mention
That he tried to take your treasure (Treasure)
(Ohh no he didn't!)
(What then?)
And as a matter of fact I would have gave you back
But then he had a heart attack when you made impact
And said his shack without you would be better (Better)
(See what I really mean, uhh, uhh)
But see, what I really mean
Is that our future queen
Should never be in frustration with this rock and roll machine
No, no, not ever (Ever)
(Yeah, huh, you know)
(What?)

You know how much I want you
You know how much I care
When he gone, you know I'm gonna flaunt you
You know, you know, you know
You know how much I want you
You know how much I care
When he gone, you know I'm gonna flaunt you
You know, you know, you know

If you really wanna find the answer to this cancer, then we must rewind
Then never mind the first opinion (Opinion)
(You better ask somebody else)
To run this game requires fame, your soul, and name, and nothing gained
Unless it's sacrificed, my dear, it's only plain for His dominion (Dominion)
And any question of the deal is met with another demand
To kneel and reprimand
Concealed allegations of your sinning (Sinning)
(Uhh, what's that all about?)
That's why, uh, uh
Feminine rising, not surprising
Recognizing that the power of the breasts is just a test
That you'll be winning (Winning)
(You got this, baby)

You know how much I want you
You know how much I care
When he gone, he know I'm gonna flaunt you
You know, you know, you know
You know how much I want you
You know how much I care
When he gone, he know I'm gonna flaunt you
You know, you know, you know

There it is
Put your head down
Just... just know thyself... know thyself
Talk to him... right

(You know how much I want you... you know, you know)
You know how much I want you
You know how much I care
When he gone, he know I'm gonna flaunt you
You know, you know, you know
