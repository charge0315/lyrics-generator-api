Hey, I think I know who you are
You're some kind of superstar
It's so great to see you again
I'm so glad we're on the same plane
You know I made a movie of you
I really got you looking good, it's true
I love the way you play your guitar
I really love the way you play your guitar
I would like to sit and talk to you for a while
I'm bored to death on this flight
I just might not make sense all the time
'Cause drugs and booze don't always mix so well
I would like to change a thing or two in my life
But you get what you deserve
I know you know, you've heard it all before
Let's get back to you, will you help me kill some time?
Hey, I feel great to be here riding so high
And I think we'll get along just fine
I saw you at Gate 33
No, no, don't think I'm some kind of groupie
So it seems you're all over the place
How do you manage to keep up the pace?
I don't really know who you are
But I love the way you play your guitar
I would like to sit and talk to you for a while
I'm bored to death on this flight
I just might not make sense all the time
'Cause drugs and booze don't always mix so well
I would like to change a thing or two in my life
But you get what you deserve
I know you know, you've heard it all before
Let's get back to you, will you help me kill some time?
Let's make the best of this situation
Ain't got much time before I lose my mind
Let's make the best of this situation
Ain't got much time before I lose my mind
Let's make the best of this situation
Ain't got much time before I lose my mind
Let's make the best of this situation
Before I lose my mind
I would like to sit and talk to you for a while
I'm bored to death on this flight
I just might not make sense all the time
'Cause drugs and booze don't always mix so well
I would like to change a thing or two in my life
But you get what you deserve
I know you know, you've heard it all before
Let's get back to you, will you help me kill some time?
