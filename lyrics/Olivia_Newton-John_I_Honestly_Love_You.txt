Maybe I hang around here
A little more than I should
We both know I got somewhere else to go
But I got something to tell you
That I never thought I would
But I believe you really ought to know

I love you (Ooh, I love you)
Ooh, I love
I honestly love you
Ooh, ooh

You don't have to answer
I see it in your eyes
Maybe it was better left unsaid
This is pure and simple
And you must realise
That it's coming from my heart and not my head

I love you (Ooh, I love you)
Ooh, I love
I honestly love you
Ooh, ooh

I'm not trying to make you feel uncomfortable
I'm not trying to make you anything at all
But this feeling doesn't come along every day
And you shouldn't blow the chance
When you've got the chance to say

(Ooh, I love you)
Ooh, I love
I
(Ooh, I love you) I love you
(I love you)
(I honestly do, I honestly do)
I honestly love you

If we both were born
In another place and time
This moment might be ending in a kiss
But there you are with yours
And here I am with mine
So I guess we'll just be leaving it at this

(Ooh, I love you) I love you
(Ooh, I love) I honestly love you
I honestly love you

(Ooh, I love you)
I honestly (love you) love you
(Ooh, I love) I honestly love you
