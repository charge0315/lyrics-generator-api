There's a grey light and it's waitin' up ahead
How long can I make it down this lonely road
Such a sad night, I can't let you go
How do we keep goin' on, now that we both know
Chorus:
Only a dreamer would ever wanna stay, but I can't give you up
Only a dreamer would carry on this way, but I can't give you up
It's a fine line, we can play it either way
Somehow we still find ourselves goin' separate ways
From the first sign of this heartache
Why do I keep goin' on, knowin' it could break
(chorus)
(Solo)
(chorus repeats out)
