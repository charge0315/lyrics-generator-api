Who's that knocking on my door?
It's gotta be a quarter to four
Is it you again coming 'round for more?
Well, you can love me tonight if you want
But in the morning, make sure you're gone
I'm talkin' to you
Hot legs wearing me out
Hot legs, you can scream and shout
Hot legs, are you still in school?
I love you, honey
Got a most persuasive tongue
You promise all kinds of fun
But what you don't understand
I'm a working man
Gonna need a shot of vitamin E
By the time you're finished with me
I'm talking to you
Hot legs, you're an alley cat
Hot legs, you scratch my back
Hot legs, bring your mother, too
I love you, honey
Imagine how my daddy felt
In your jet black suspender belt
Seventeen years old, he's touching sixty four
You got legs right up to your neck
You're making me a physical wreck
I'm talking to you
Hot legs in your satin shoes
Hot legs, are you still in school?
Hot legs, you're making me a fool
I love you, honey
Hot legs making your mark
Hot legs, you keep my pencil sharp
Hot legs, keep your hands to yourself
I love you, honey, yeah
Hot legs, you're wearing me out
Hot legs, you can scream and shout
Hot legs, you're still in school
I love you, honey!
Hot legs
Hot legs, yeah, baby
Hot legs, getting hotter
Hot legs, you're well-equipped
Hot legs, oh, your pussy's whipped
Hot legs, I just love your lips
I love ya
I love ya
I love ya, honey
Hot legs
Hot legs, woo!
Hot legs, yeah-ah
I love ya, honey!
