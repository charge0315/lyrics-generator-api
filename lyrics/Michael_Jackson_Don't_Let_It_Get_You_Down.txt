Don't let it get you down
When you're not on top
A winner stumbles, too
But gets up and never stops, no
Ain't it a double shame, not to play no friendly game
Don't let it get you down, ah, no
Don't let it get you down
When the cards are wrong
Pick up, don't let them walk away
Before you lose your heart
(Don't regret, girl)
Ain't it a double shame, not to play no friendly game
Don't let it get you down
(Ah, no)
Ah, no
Look at me
Don't it seem like I know what I'm talkin' about
Don't be mean
Let me please be the one that can straighten it out, girl
(Don't let it get you down, don't let it)
(Don't let it get you down, don't let it)
Ain't it a double shame, not to play no friendly game
Don't let it get you down (Ah, no, don't let it)
I can be your sunshine, make you happy
Ain't no cloudy skies hangin' over me, yeah
(Don't let it get you down)
Don't let it get you down
You can start again
Now, yesterday is gone
Let tomorrow be your friend
(Don't regret, girl)
Hey, don't regret, girl
My luck is still ahead
Don't let it get you down
(Ah, no)
Ah, no
Look at me
Don't it seem like I know what I'm talkin' about
Don't be mean
Let me please be the one that can straighten it out, girl
I can straighten it out, girl, yeah
(Don't let it get you down)
Straighten it out, girl, come on
Don't let it get you down
Don't let it, let it, let it...
(Don't let it get you down)
No, don't let it
(Don't let it get you down)
Don't let it get you down
(Don't let it get you down)
Don't let it, let it, let it...
(Don't let it get you down)
Don't let it, let it, let it...
Don't let it get you down, come on
(Don't let it get you down)
Don't let it get you down, yeah
(Don't let it get you down)
Yeah, huh, yeah, come on baby
Don't let it get you down
(Don't let it get you down)
Yeah, huh, yeah, come on baby
Don't let it get you down
Come on, sugar, yeah
