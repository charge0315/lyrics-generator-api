We gonn' work it out
We gonn' turn this 'round
We gonn' show you how to make it
We gonn' work it out
Let me show you how
We gonn' work it out, yeah
I know some things
And you should listen to me
Young brothas never listen to what the grown folks say
But you know better
Look around the streets
Ain't nothin' but liquor stores, funerals, and check cashing places
We gonn' work it out
(We gonn' work this out)
We gonn' turn this 'round
(We gonn' turn this 'round)
The pendulum is swingin' right above your head
We gonn' work it out
Let me show you how
Get on ya feet and stand up for where you lay
(Can't give) Can't give whatcha never had
(Show them) Show them love, good or bad
They'll hate your better state
Try to keep you down from flyin'
Let's get, to a better baby
Love flows, how crazy
Conditions at the moment
Our mission set us straight (ooh, yeah)
We gonn' work it out
(We gonn' work it out)
We gonn' turn this 'round
(We gonn' turn this 'round)
The pendulum is swingin' right above your head
We gonn' work it out (work it out)
Let me show you how (show you how)
Gonn' live the life that life was meant to be
Get up off them corners right now y'all
Let's slang a revolution
The system is a minority vault
You're as good as gold as long as you're in an institution
We gonn' work it out
(We gonn' work it out)
We gonn' turn this 'round
(We gonn' turn this 'round)
The pendulum is swingin' right above your head
We gonn' work it out (work it out)
Let me show you how (show you how)
Gonn' live the life that life was meant to be
Get up off them corners right now y'all
Let's slang some revolution
The system is a minority vault
You're as good as gold as long as you're in an institution
Get up off them corners right now y'all
Let's slang a revolution
The system is a minority vault
You're as good as gold as long as you're in an institution
Work it out, let's work it out...
Let's work it out, let's work it out...
We gonn' work it out
We gonn' turn this 'round
Gonn' work it out...
