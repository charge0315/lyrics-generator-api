Oh-oh, oh-oh

I've got something new for you
When it hits, you won't know what to do
Relax, let me
Move you
Don't resist—it's in the air
Just one taste will take you there
Let it flow right
Through you
I know you're getting tired of the same old thing
But I'm gon' break the rules, gonna change the game
You'll be screaming
My name
And I'm gon' take you places you've never seen
You couldn't picture this in your wildest dreams
Don't fear, 'cause you're here
With me

Let's get lifted
(Lifted)
Ooh, I'm gonna get you high
I'm really gonna blow your mind (Mind)
We'll get lifted
(Lifted) Oh-oh
You're gonna feel it in your soul
And, baby, you will lose control
We'll get lifted
High-igh-igh-igh-igh, oh-oh

And once you take a hit of this
You won't ever wanna quit
You'll be so
Addicted
Then I'll have you spinning round and round
Crazy making freaky sounds
You won't want to
Come down
And then I'll have you seeing things and hallucinating
Even walking funny, 'cause your legs are shaking
All night, we'll be
Blazin'
Oh, I'll take you for a walk to the other side
We can get high and enjoy the ride
Hold tight, we'll be
Alright

We'll get lifted
(Lifted) Oh-oh
I'm gonna get you high
I'm really gonna blow your mind (Mind)
We'll get lifted
(Lifted) Oh-oh
You're gonna feel it in your soul
And baby, you will lose control
We'll get lifted
High-igh-igh, oh-oh-oh-oh

Come on and go with me (So much I wanna show you)
Yeah-yeah (I'll take you hight)
I'll take you there
Come on, let me take you there (High)
I will show you (So much I wanna show you)
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh (I'll take you hight)
I'll take you there (High)
I'll take you there
I will show you (So much I wanna show you)
Hey (I'll take you hight)
I'll take you there
Come on, let me take you there (High)
So much I wanna show you
I'll take you high
High-igh-igh
