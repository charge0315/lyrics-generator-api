Do be
Everybody says to you all the time
To be true
Everybody want
But no one can find
To be loved
A human need that is never felt
Well baby I don't care
Just to be there
And to be down
Its time to know
Just what is so
And what you like
I give you me
You give me you
And that's alright
Just what I'm trying to say
In this fragile love of the way we found
Since you finally unwound
Just to be you
And do be down
I just wanna know
No matter where we go
Girl let's no destruct what we adore
Strange as it may sound
Let's keep this love around
You for me
Me for you
That's all I wanna do
Do be you
What everybody say to you all the time
To be true
Everybody wants but no one can find
To be loved
A human need that is never felt
Well baby I don't care
Just to be there
And do be down
Well baby I don't care
Please be there
And do be down
Well baby I don't care
Do be there
And do be down
Well baby I don't care
Do be down
And do be down
Well baby I don't care
