Hi, I thought I'd drop by, so nice to see you
It's been too long since I was holding you
I've been holding on to a prayer
'Cause my dreams never seem to come true
Oh, I'm never letting go, never letting go
Never letting go, it's not that easy
Oh, I'm never letting go, never letting go
Never letting go, I'm crazy about you
But I can live without you
I left the kitchen lights on these past three nights
It don't know why just keep shining bright
And now your eyes ain't answering from a mile
Is there someone else again this time?
Oh, I'm never letting go, never letting go
Never letting go, it's not that easy
Oh, I'm never letting go, never letting go
Never letting go, I'm crazy about you
But I can live without you
I could be a gentleman and walk away with style
But I fight to keep you, throw my arms around you
This is crazy I know but I just end the show
I'm never letting go, never, never
Never letting go, never letting go
Never letting go, it's not that easy
Oh, I'm never letting go, never letting go
Never letting go, I'm crazy about you
Never letting go, never letting go
Never letting go
Never letting go, never letting go
Never letting go
Never letting go, never letting go
Never letting go
Never letting go, never letting go
Never letting go
Never letting go, never letting go
Never letting go
