This path was trampled once before
Burden of my days
Devotion can wait
The bite is deeper than before
Poison meet the vein
Too numb for the pain

Voices of mercy have begun singing my name
Rosaries and requiems
Visions of fires and fortune cursed by blind faith
Rosaries and requiems

I am the hunter and the prey
Delusions win
Illusions can betray you
I know you've traveled oceans far
My memory a scar
That won't fade away

Voices of mercy have begun singing my name
Rosaries and requiems
Visions of fires and fortune cursed by blind faith
Rosaries and requiems
Voices of mercy have begun singing my name
Rosaries and requiems
Visions of fires and fortune cursed by blind faith
Rosaries and requiems
