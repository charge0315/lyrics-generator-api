Just when everything's in order and good
Things fall apart
Just when life should be resolving, I'm back at the beginning
And it comes back to the heart

I'm not really sad, I'm not running, I'm looking
Did I tell you I kept all your letters and cards?

There's just nothing left for me to do here but unhook the stars
There's just nothing left for me to do here but unhook the stars

Do you remember when I told you all that I could
And it seemed like too much
I was living your life, hoping you'd never fall
If I held on tight enough

And letting go now is like a passport to anywhere
With time on my hands I can make a new start

I just didn't wanna stay here and unhook the stars
I just didn't wanna stay here and unhook the stars

Don't worry for me
It's just I'm inspired
Waiting in the wings
Made me drunk with possibilities
Rivals my memories

I didn't wanna stay here and unhook the stars
I just didn't wanna stay here and unhook the stars

Everything's in order and good
Things fall apart
Just when life should be resolving and I'm back at the beginning
It comes back to the heart

I'm not really sad, I'm not running, I'm looking
Did I tell you I kept all your letters and cards?

There's just nothing left for me to do here but unhook the stars
There's just nothing left for me to do here but unhook the stars

Didn't wanna stay here and unhook the stars
Didn't wanna stay here and unhook the stars
I didn't wanna stay here and unhook the stars
