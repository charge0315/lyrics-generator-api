At a young and desperate age, like the heroes we once played
We were so courageous, just enough to make it real

Fearless is the child that sees, what his life is meant to be
Like the fighter, he will dance to stay alive, alive

Fearless, nothin's left to hide, fearless on the other side
Ridin' free and fearless on a raging sea
Is the only thing that keeps you alive

Livin' like he's on the run, fearless knows what he's become
He's still courageous, like the hero, he survives, survives

(Solo)
 (lines 2 & 3)
Fearless, nothin's left to hide, fearless on the other side
Fearless, always fearless
(repeats out)
