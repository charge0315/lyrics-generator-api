Every time you go
Missing you so, something deep
Baby come around
Missing you now, something deep
(Deeper, going deeper down without you, baby)

Why'd you have to take me there?
You start the fire, then you put it out
I have to depend on my imagination
I didn't want to fade what you've been putting down
But then you say the word, then I go under

It's more confusing by the hour
You set me free, but you don't go away
I try to think about somebody else
That's when I know I just can't help myself
So baby say the word, and take me over
