If'n I was God
Well, just for spite
I wouldn't set the sun at night
'Til everyone was treated right
By everyone else they see

If'n I was God
I'd fix it so without explaining
Folks would know, they'd know
What's goin' on inside
Of everyone else like me

Nobody hurts, nobody else
Oh, no, I wouldn't let it be
Nobody have a need to pray
Except for thankin' me

If'n I were God
I'd make us wise
So everyone could realize
That everywhere beneath the sun
Everyone needs everyone
And God, that ain't half what I would do
If'n I were You-oo-oo-ooo-oo-ooo-hoooo
Oh, yeah!
If'n I were God
Love each other, reach out
And touch somebody's hand
Oh yeah!
