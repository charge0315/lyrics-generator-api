Mmm until you I never knew
It’s true when I desire
Searching but never knowing
When love would come around mm
All that change came true
When you came into my life
Then you had to go
The reasons that I did not know

And you know the hope
That soon the winds will change
And you return
Waiting the return of love’s revival
A moment that could never be too soon
Yes, I’m waiting for the spring of love’s revival
Like a flower waiting for an early bloom
Oooh

Everyday you still inspire my world
When I think of you
Only wish I knew what keeps you got so long
You should know though time has passed
That I’m, I’m still holding on
Something oh so strong
That I could choose nothing  oh no

I can only hope
That soon the winds will change
And you return
Waiting the return of love’s revival
A moment that could never be too soon
Yes, I’m waiting for the spring of love’s revival
Like a flower waiting for an early bloom
Oooh

Come on home
It’s not too late
Won’t you come on home
It’s not too late

(I’m waiting)
Waiting the return of love’s revival
(yes,I’m waiting for love)
A moment that could never be too soon( be too soon, yeah yeah)
Yes, I’m waiting for the spring of love’s revival
Like a flower waiting for an early bloom
(Like a flower waiting for an early bloom)
Waiting the return of love’s revival
(I’m waiting yeah)
A moment that could never be too soon
( never be too soon, yeah yeah) (I’m waiting)
Yes, I’m waiting for the spring of love’s revival
( I’am waiting yeah yeah)
Like a flower waiting for an early bloom
