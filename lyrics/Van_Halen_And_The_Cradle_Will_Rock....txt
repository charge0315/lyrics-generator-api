Ow!
Oh, yeah, get up
Ow!
Ow, ow!

Well, they say it's kinda frightenin' how this younger generation swings
You know, it's more than just some new sensation
Well, the kid is into losin' sleep, and he don't come home for half the week
You know, it's more than just an aggravation

And the cradle will rock
Yes, the cradle will rock
And I say, "Rock on"
Ooh, rock on

And when some local kid gets down, they try and drum him out of town
They say, "You coulda at least faked it, boy, fake it, boy" (ooh, stranger boy)
At an early age, he hits the street, and winds up tied with who he meets, and he's unemployed (unemployed)

Ow, and the cradle will rock, ow!
And the cradle will rock, the cradle will rock
And I say, "Rock on"
Oh, say, "Rock on"

Have you seen Junior's grades?
Ow!

And when some local kid gets down, they try and drum him out of town
They say, "You coulda at least faked it, boy, faked it, boy"
And so an early age he hits the street, winds up tied with who he meets, and he's unemployed
His folks are overjoyed

And the cradle will rock
Yes, the cradle will rock
I say, "Rock on"
Yeah, rock on

Rock on, rock on
Rock on, rock on (this ain't nothin' new, baby, child)
Ow! (Rock on)
(I said, "Rock on") rock on, rock on
Rock on (oh, oh, oh)
Rock on (oh, oh, oh)
Rock on (oh, oh, oh)
Rock on
Rock on
