Falling in love, falling in love, falling in love with you
Falling in love with you

Wise man say only fools rush in
But I can't help

Falling in love, falling in love, falling in love with you
Falling in love with you

Shall I stay
Would it be a sin
If I can't help

Falling in love, falling in love, falling in love with you
Falling in love with you

Like a river flows, surely to the sea
Darling, so it goes
That some things are meant to be
Take my hand
Take my whole life too
For I can't help

Falling in love, falling in love, falling in love with you
Falling in love with you

Like a river flows, surely to the sea
Darling, so it goes
That some things are meant to be
Take my hand
Take my whole life too
For I can't help

Falling in love, falling in love, falling in love with you
Falling in love with you
Falling in love, falling in love, falling in love with you
Falling in love with you
Falling in love, falling in love, falling in love with you...
