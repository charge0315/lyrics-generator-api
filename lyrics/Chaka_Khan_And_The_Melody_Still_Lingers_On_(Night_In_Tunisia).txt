A long time ago in the '40s
Dizzy and Bird gave us this song
They called it "A Night in Tunisia"
And the melody still lingers on

It was new and very strange
Blew the squares right off the stage
Few could play along
But the melody still lingers on
Max and Miles to name just two
Together they grew
The music was young and strong
And the melody still lingers on

They paved the way for generations
From Coltrane to Stevie
No one could stop the winds of change
Without them, where would we be?

The Duke and the Prez were there before
The past you can't ignore
The torch is lit, we'll keep the flame
And the melody remains the same

The Duke and the Prez were there before
The past you can't ignore
The torch is lit, we'll keep the flame
And the melody remains the same

A long time ago in the '40s
Dizzy and Bird gave us this song
They called it "A Night in Tunisia"
And the melody still lingers on

In the '40s, "A Night in Tunisia"
In the '40s, "A Night in Tunisia"
In the '40s, "A Night in Tunisia"
In the '40s, "A Night in Tunisia"
