Jada's coming home
Jada's coming home
She went across the Bay bridge
But she ain't gone for long
Jada's coming home
Jada's quite a gal
She's in love with Al
But he don't love her, no we know
He is in love with Sally so
He gon' break her heart
Now when she drives up in that Volvo
And the horn begins to blow
I am gonna get out my chair
Run down the stairs
And open up the door
'Cause, Jada is my friend
Don't want to see her hurt again
'Cause she has such a pretty smile
Jada is my only child

Now when she drives up in that Volvo
And the horn begins to blow
I am gonna get out my chair
Run down the stairs
And open up the door
'Cause, Jada is my friend
Don't want to see her hurt again
'Cause she has such a pretty smile
Jada is my only child
(het slot is erg moeilijk te verstaan
Maar hier een voorzichtige poging)
Bad I hurt him then
And he will hardly have a hope
Sorrow sitting there, ribbons in her hair
Such a pretty child, oh what a smile
He loves me, he loves me not
He loves me not, that's what I got
I taught you all your ABC's, didn't I?
Here me out. Why don't you leave me at all
Boom! She-bop! She's gonna go for the top
Sure can't tell her when to stop
Easy cause her daddy
Don't you mess with my daughter
Jada's coming home
