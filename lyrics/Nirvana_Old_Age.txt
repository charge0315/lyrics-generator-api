We're rolling
Are we or not?

One more day to complete my service
One more high to decay my nervous
Wondering how I'm gonna find a way; it's over
One more debt to complete my service
One more time here to fade my servant
One more day if I find a way; over

She seemed to read minds
And I know a later time
We could lay here with you
Leave the soul

Old age
Old age
Old age
Old age

One more day to complain my servant
One more doubt here to find a servant
One more time here if I find a way; it's over
Wondering how I'll maintain my cover
One more day here to save my lover
Wondering how I'm gonna find a way; it's over

She seemed to read minds
And I know a later time
We could lay here with you
Leave the soul

Old age
Old age
Old age
Old age

Just you need, you read, you're a freak
Hmmm
And knew, you read, you flew
Ooo
Hmmm

One more day to complete my circuit
One more high here to find my nervous
Someday I'm gonna find a way; it's over
One more doubt here to claim my supper
I can have anything you want to
One more day if I find a way; it's over

She seemed to read minds
And I know we run out of time
Breathe the way here with you
Dream the same on the dew
Breathe the same on her
Take a moan on a man
Breathe the shame onto you
Breathe the lie

Old age
Old age
Old age
Old age
Old age
Old age
Old age

*Buzzing*
You like that, ya, like that or fade?
Or we could fade out?
