Pulled through you and drowning in your swirl
Unfolding in your will
I'm on a mission now
Smoldering down inside your mood
And fanning your eyes
I'm on a mission now

I'm gonna dive through your crying and sleep in your hair
Rise from your ashes and kneel in your prayers
Tear all your temples down

(Yeah) I'm on a mission now, I'm on a mission now
(Hey) I'm on a mission now, I'm on a mission now
Hah

Pulled through you and drowning in your swirl
Unfolding in your will
I'm on a mission now

I'm gonna glide on the winds of your breathing
Writhe in your calm and provide your release
Weave into your wanting and needing
And reside in the heart of your strongest beliefs
Tear all our temples down

Oh, I'm on a mission now
I'm on a mission now

And I have nothing, but then
The have is not as good as the want
I have nothing, but then
The have is not as good as the want, oh

I'm on a mission now
I'm on a mission now, I'm on a mission now
I'm on a mission now, I'm on a mission now
I'm on a mission now
I'm on a mission now, I'm on a mission now, ow
