Drivin' home this evenin'
Coulda sworn we had it all worked out
You had this boy believin'
Way beyond the shadow of a doubt, Yeah
Well, I heard it on the street
I heard you might've found somebody new, Yeah
Well, who is he, baby?
Who is he and tell me what he means to you? Oh, yeah

I took it all for granted
But how was I to know
That you'd be letting go

Now it cuts like a knife!
But it feels so right
Yeah, it cuts like a knife
Oh, but it feels so right

There's times I've been mistaken
There's times I thought I'd been misunderstood, Ooh, yeah
So wait a minute, darlin'
Can't you see we did the best we could?
Ooh, we could

This wouldn't be the first time
That things have gone astray
Now you've thrown it all away

Now it cuts like a knife
Yeah! But It feels so right
Oh, it cuts like a knife
