Wait, before it's too late
Is he what you need?
I won't hold you back if you must go
If he makes you complete
I won't try to compete
If this time you're sure
You're free to go

But girl before you leave
There's time to change your mind
Change your mind?
(Think it over)
(Think it over)

I know that
You're at the point of no return
Oh oh...
There ain't no turning back
Yeah...
There ain't no turning back
(There's no turning back)
(There's no turning)
You're at the point of no return
Oh oh...
There ain't no turning back
Yеs...
There ain't no turning back
(Therе's no turning back)
(There's no turning)

I won't stand in your way
Or beg you to stay
If this love is real
I'll back away
When you walk out that door
You had better be sure
The love that you feel
For him is real

But girl before you leave
There's time to change your mind
Change your mind?
(Think it over)
(Think it over)

I know that
You're at the point of no return
Yeah
There ain't no turning back
Oh oh...
There ain't no turning back
Hey yeah yeah
(There's no turning back)
(There's no turning)
You're at the point of no return
Yeah yeah
There ain't no turning back
Whoo huu...
There ain't no turning back
(There's no turning back)
(There's no turning)
You're at the point of no return
Yeah
There ain't no turning back
No no...
There ain't no turning back
