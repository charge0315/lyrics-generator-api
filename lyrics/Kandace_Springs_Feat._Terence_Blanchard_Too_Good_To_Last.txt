Saw you walking by
It was like I already knew you
It felt like deja vu
We talked into the night
And made love in the moonlight
Until the sky went blue

But it was too good to last
Too sweet to stay in place
We fell so fast
The pieces broke away
They say the hotter you burn
The faster you fade
But we're still the best
Mistake that I've made
Too bad, too bad, too bad, too bad, too bad
Too good to last
Too good to last

Wish the truth could lie
I didn't want to feel it
But you stole half of my heart
Took me on a sky dive
I thought it was the real thing
But we fell so far apart

But it was too good to last
Too sweet to stay in place
We fell so fast
The pieces broke away
They say the hotter you burn
The faster you fade
But you're still the best
Mistake that I've made
Too bad, too bad, too bad, too bad, too bad
Too good to last
Too good to last

Should've known right from the start...

It was too good to last
Too sweet to stay in place
We fell so fast
The pieces broke away
They say the hotter you burn
The faster you fade
But you're still the best
Mistake that I've made
Too bad, too bad, too bad, too bad, too bad
Too good to last
Too good to last
Too good to last
