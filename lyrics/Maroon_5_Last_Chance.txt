I'm sure that he could give you everything
Stability and diamond rings
All the things I do not have
I understand you can't handle that
But for everything that I lack
I provide something you almost had
Hot flesh that you yearn to grab
Pit of your stomach, you're still so sad

Ooh, what you gonna do?
I'm in love with you
Don't you wanna dance?
This may be the last chance (Last chance)
That I get (I get) to love you (To love you)
Ooh-ooh-ooh

Out of sight, not out of mind
You want the world, I'll give you mine
'Cause you're the girl I'll never find
And I'm the boy you've left behind, whoa
I know you think you're satisfied
And God knows how hard we try
But if you showed up at my door (Ooh)
I could give you so much more, oh

Ooh, what you gonna do?
I'm in love with you
Don't you wanna dance?
This may be the last chance (Last chance)
That I get (I get) to love you (To love you)
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, what am I gonna do?
I don't like to lose
You're not making sense
This may be the last chance (Last chance)
That you get (You get) to love me (Love me)
Ooh-ooh-ooh

Oh, you sure don't make it easy to get myself to safety
You tell me that I'm crazy
But you're the one who makes me this way
You call yourself impulsive
But that's what makes us so explosive

So as I burn these photographs
I wonder if you kept the ones you have
Keep them locked up somewhere safe
'Cause it's the only place you'll see my face

Ooh, what you gonna do?
I'm in love with you
Why don't you wanna dance?
'Cause this may be the last chance (Last chance)
That I get (I get) to love you (To love you)
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, what am I gonna do?
I don't like to lose
You're not making sense
'Cause this may be the last chance (Last chance)
That you get (You get) to love me (Love me)
Ooh-ooh-ooh

'Cause this may be the last chance (Last chance)
That I get (I get) to love you (Love you)
Ooh-ooh-ooh
To love you (Love you)
Ooh-ooh-ooh
