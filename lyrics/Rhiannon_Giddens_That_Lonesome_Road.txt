Look down, look down that lonesome road
Before you travel on
Look up, look up and seek your maker
Before Gabriel blows his horn
Weary, toting such a load
Trudging down that lonesome road
Look down, look down that lonesome road
Before you travel on
Look down, look down that lonesome road
Before you travel on
Look up, oh look up and see your maker
Before Gabriel blows his horn
Weary, toting such a load
Trudging down that lonesome road
Look down that lonesome road
Before you travel on
Weary toting such a load
Trudging down that lonesome road
Look down, look down, look down that lonesome road
Before you travel on
