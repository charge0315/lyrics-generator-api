Well, she's kind of pretty
Drives a big car too
And when I hold her in my arms
I never know what to do
If she's got everything she needs
What does she need me for?
I'm just a crazy fool
Comin' back for more
And I know
She's no good
Can't leave her
But I know I should
Everybody says watch out boy
She'll break your heart like it was a toy
You better save it for a rainy day
You better save it for a rainy day
Well I'd leave in a minute
If I only could
But when she touches me
It makes me feel so good
My heart's in her hands
This is a sure a mess
There's no way I say no
When she says, "yes yes yes"
Take me, shake me
And tell me this ain't a dream
Everybody says watch out boy
She'll break your heart like it was a toy
You better save it for a rainy day
You better save it for a rainy day
