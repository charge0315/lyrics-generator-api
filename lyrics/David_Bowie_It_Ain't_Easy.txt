When you climb to the top of the mountain, look out over the sea
Think about the places, perhaps, where a young man could be
Then you jump back down to the rooftops, look out over the town
Think about all of the strange things circulating 'round

It ain't easy, it ain't easy
It ain't easy to get to heaven when you're going down

Well, all the people have got their problems, that ain't nothing new
With the help of the good Lord, we can all pull on through
We can all pull on through, get there in the end
Sometimes it'll take you right up and sometimes down again

It ain't easy, it ain't easy
It ain't easy to get to heaven when you're going down

Satisfaction, satisfaction, keep me satisfied
I've got the love of a hoochie coochie woman, she calling from inside
She's a-calling from inside, trying to get to you
All the woman really wants, you can give her something too

It ain't easy, it ain't easy
It ain't easy to get to heaven when you're going down
It ain't easy, it ain't easy
It ain't easy to get to heaven when you're going down
