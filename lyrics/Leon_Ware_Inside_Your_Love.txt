Uh, uh, inside your love
Uh, uh, inside your love
Uh, uh
Two people, just meeting
Barely touching each other
Two spirits, just greeting
Trying to carry it farther
You are one, and I am another
We should be one inside each other
Let me live inside you
Can I come inside you?
Let me ride inside your love
Let me live inside you
Can I come inside you?
Let me ride inside your love
Uh, uh, inside your lovе (Your love)
Uh, uh, inside your love (Your lovе)
Uh, uh, uh, inside your love
Uh, uh, inside your love
Two strangers, not strangers
Only lacking the knowing
So willing, ooh, feeling
The infinite growing
While we're here, the whole world is turning
We could be one, fulfilling our yearning
Let me live inside you
Can I come inside you?
Let me ride inside your love
Let me live inside you
Can I come inside you?
Let me ride inside your love
Uh, uh, inside your love (Your love)
Uh, uh, inside your love
Uh, uh, uh, inside your love (Yeah)
Uh, uh
Let me live inside you
Let me live inside your love
Let me live inside you
Let me live inside your love
Let me live inside you
Let me live inside your love
Let me live inside you
Can I come inside you?
Let me ride inside your love
Let me live inside you
Can I come inside you?
Let me ride inside your love
Let me live inside you (Let me live)
Can I come inside you? (Let me come)
Let me ride (Let me touch you, inside your love)
Let me live inside you (Oh)
Can I come inside you? (Let me ride)
Let me ride
Let me live inside you (I wanna live)
Can I come inside you? (I wanna love)
Let me ride (Inside your love)
Let me live inside you (Inside your love)
Can I come inside you? (Inside your love)
Let me ride (Inside your love)
Let me live inside you (Inside your love)
Can I come inside you? (Inside your love)
Let me ride (Inside your love)
