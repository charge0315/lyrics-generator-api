At the end of everyday
When the world is far away
I run to you
It's a world without a care
When I see you standing there
I ask myself
If I could think of just one word I will describe
(A perfect harmony), you have given me
Now that I've found you, it's so good to be alive
(Forever for the rest), you chose me for the best

And I'm so grateful
For all the love, you've (Given me) given me
So grateful
You are my life
You are my lovе
You are my (destiny) destiny
And I'll always bе, (in love with you) in love with you
I'll always be, (grateful) grateful to you

Out of all the love I find
You have been just what I needed all the time (All the time)
You have made me realize
I can tell the world go on (go on, go on) and kiss goodbye
Cause everytime you hold me closer in your arms
I feel just like a king
High, high, high up on a throne
I'll stand beside you, and will be your number one
To there (There is no other find) no other find
The stars fall down the skies

And I'm so grateful
For all the love, that you've (given me) given me
So grateful
'Cause you are my life
And you are my love
And you are my (destiny) destiny
I'll always be, (in love with you) in love with you
I'll always be, (grateful to you) grateful to you
And I'm so grateful
For all the love, that you've (Given me) given me
So grateful
But you are my life
But you are my love
But you are my (Destiny) destiny
I'll always be (In love with you) in love with you
I'll always be (Grateful to you) grateful to you
