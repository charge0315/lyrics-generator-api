Yeah, breakdown
Minneapolis style

Every time another boy speaks
If they catchin' feelings and they wanna get with me
I don't hear no evil or see it
Don't matter anyway 'cause they will never be with me
I got what I want and he's home
Waitin' on me to call him on the phone
To ask him what he wants from the store
I give him what he needs and baby, so much more

Ain't another man that can make me love him
'Cause I only place God and the sky above him
He's the one that brings me joy
As long as were together, there'll never be another boy

Everywhere we go people stare (Think they don't?)
They could be jealous but I just don't care (I don't care)
Perception ain't really the truth
They could never take me away from you (Uh-uh)
Every time another boy pass
Think about how sad I was in the past (Yeah)
Hopin' with a knife in my back (My back)
That everything was cool but he was makin' plans

Just another failed romance (Romance)
'Cause a one trick pony ain't got no chance (No)
Don't need another toy ('Nother toy)
'Cause baby, you're my lover, there'll never be another boy

Sister and my mother
Father and my brother
This is what the difference will be
The only one that lasts through all of history

Yeah, (Uh) right there (Uh)
Every time another boy speaks
Kind words of praise or fantasy
To me they're just another boy
And not the coolest boy who brings me joy (Yup)
'Cause I got him
(There'll never be another boy)
Yes, it's you baby like water for chocolate
(There'll never be another boy)
I'll do anything, anything to make you see
(There'll never be another boy)
That you're the only, only one for me
(There'll never be another boy)
I like the smell of you're sweet cologne
The I don't care style of your hair
(There'll never be another boy)
Just ask and I'll cook the things you like
When them other girls cupboard's just bare
(There'll never be another boy) Oh
Yes, here it is, you see this, you got it
(There'll never be another boy)
I said it's you babe, like water for chocolate
Forever, baby
(There'll never be another boy)
