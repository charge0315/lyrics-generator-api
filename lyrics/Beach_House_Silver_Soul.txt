We gather matters of the heart
So we can act a fool
It's incomplete without you
The silver soul is running through
It's a vision, complete illusion, yeah

The needle on the spinning wheel
Collecting silver coil
It gathers heat without you
Whether or not you turn from it
It's a quick turn to let us in, yeah

It is happening again
It is happening again
It is happening again, ah-ah
It is happening again

The bodies lying in the sand
They're moving in the dark
It is so quick to let us in
We feel it moving through our skin
It's a sickness, infinite quickness, yeah

It is happening again
It is happening again
It is happening again, ah-ah
It is happening again
(And if you want to, step inside the room)
It is happening again, ah-ah
(All your fears will subside and you will come in soon)
It is happening again
(How cool and sweet, of flame comes the start)
It is happening again, ah-ah
(Let it breathe, move and spread these lies to and from the heart)
It is happening again
(And if you want to, step inside the room)
It is happening again, ah-ah
(All your fears will subside and you will come in soon)
It is happening again
(How cool and sweet)
It is happening again
