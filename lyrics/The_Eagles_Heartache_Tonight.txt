Somebody's gonna hurt someone
Before the night is through
Somebody's gonna come undone
There's nothin' we can do
Everybody wants to touch somebody
If it takes all night
Everybody wants to take a little chance
It make it come out right
There's gonna be a heartache tonight
A heartache tonight, I know
There's gonna be a heartache tonight
A heartache tonight, I know, yes, I know
Some people like to stay out late
Some folks can't hold out that long
Nobody wants to go home now
There's too much goin' on
This night is gonna last forever
It might last all summer long
Some time before the sun comes up
The radio is gonna play that song
There's gonna be a heartache tonight
A heartache tonight, I know
There's gonna be a heartache tonight
A heartache tonight, I know, yes, I know
There's gonna be a heartache tonight
The moon's shinin' bright
So turn out the light and we'll get it right
There's gonna be a heartache tonight
A heartache tonight, I know
Somebody's gonna hurt someone
Before the night is through
Somebody's gonna come undone
There's nothin' we can do
Everybody wants to touch somebody
If it takes all night
Everybody wants to take a little chance
It make it come out right
There's gonna be a heartache tonight
A heartache tonight, I know
There's gonna be a heartache tonight
A heartache tonight, I know, so let's go
We can beat around the bushes
We can get down to the bone
We can leave it in the parkin' lot
But either way we're goin'
There's gonna be a heartache tonight
A heartache tonight I know
There'll be a heartache tonight
A heartache tonight, I know
