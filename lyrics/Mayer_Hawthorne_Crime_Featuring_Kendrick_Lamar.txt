Waterfront, sunshine
A little weed, a little red wine
Then come the five-oh
Citation, it's illegal

We just wanna party
We don't mean no harm
Don't wanna hurt nobody
But they make it so hard
We just wanna party
Just wanna rock all night
Don't wanna hurt nobody
No need to be uptight

It's a crime
It's a crime
It's a crime
It's a crime

Backyard, tune's right
Girls dancin' in the moonlight
Then come the one time (Woop, woop)
Regulation, gotta pay the fine

We just wanna party
We don't mean no harm
Don't wanna hurt nobody
But they make it so hard
We just wanna party
Just wanna rock all night
Don't wanna hurt nobody
No need to be uptight

It's a crime
It's a crime
It's a crime
It's a crime

Pour up another shot of Hennessy, my tendency to start the party with
Probably hit that Bob Marley, I ain't with that Molly shit
Represent, my nigga, bang your hood
Bloods and Crips in the same building, it's all good
I'm lookin' at this pretty fine thing rollin' with her friend
Hopin' I can make her mind change, jump inside my Benz
Let me get it crackin'
Conversation turn to plenty sexual frustration
Fuck faces lookin' at her, hard to not be impatient
Oh, really though? You drink? You smoke?
Get a case, get a eighth, fly high (High), not coach (Coach)
G5 (5), sit back (Back), I'll drive (Drive), let me know (Know)
On the couch (Uh), on the bed (Uh), on the floor (Uh), say go (Go)
Say when, in the wind, we go, we toast
To the game, no games, we both really grown
I'm sayin', you playin', I mean, I dance
To my own beat, to the beat, now flip your hands and
Let the smoke burn, let the smoke burn in your vein
When it's your turn, hit it twice, then say my name
Say my name, say my name, I appear like Candyman
Dark chocolate, vanilla, I tell you this is Candy Land
This is
Candid Camera, there's no pauses allowed
They don't understand us because we won't turn it down
Middle fingers in the air, this is truth and double dare
Three hundred drunk motherfuckers in the holding cell, haha

Ooh-woah, ooh-woah
Ooh-woah, woah
Ooh-woah, ooh-woah
Ooh-woah, woah

We just wanna party
We don't mean no harm
Don't wanna hurt nobody
But they make it so hard
We just wanna party
Just wanna rock all night
Don't wanna hurt nobody
No need to be uptight
We just wanna party (It's a crime)
We don't mean no harm
Don't wanna hurt nobody (It's a crime)
But they make it so hard
We just wanna party (It's a crime)
Just wanna rock all night
Don't wanna hurt nobody (It's a crime)
No need to be uptight
