I'm sorry for the things I said
And for the times I tuned you out
It's crazy how we hurt the ones
We love and truly care about
You're a blessing in my life
Even though we push and pull
It's all right
The attraction in that we are opposites
That keeps us pull together yeah

Stars lose their shine
It's hard to see the light
When love is in decline
Some just let go
We carry on
Holding on strong
'Til the end of the line
Yes we go on and on and on
Believing in our song
This love was born in flames
That's why it still remains
Oh
Ahh
Ahh

Somehow I hope that we can reconcile
Not waste another day
If the madness should unfold
I know we can have some tenderness
Ohh yes
You complete me in my life
You're the one I need
My all and all
Let's find a way to bring it back
Get the promise of our future back on track
Oh yeah

Stars lose their shine
It's hard to see the light
When love is in decline
Some just let go
We carry on
Holding on strong
'Til the end of the line
Yes we go on and on and on
Believing in our song
This love was born in flames
That's why it still remains
Yeah oh
Ahh
Ahh

This love
Born in flames
Ahh
Ohh
This love was
Born in flames
Ahh
Ohh
Eh eh
Born in flames
That's why it still remains
Oh ohh yeah
Ahh ah ah yeah
In flames
Ah
This love was born in flames
Ooh
Ahh oohhh
Ahh
This love was born in flames
