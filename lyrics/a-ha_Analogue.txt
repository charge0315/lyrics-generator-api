Come back, my darling one
I'm calling on you
The road ahead is long
And I must warn you
I wonder where did she go?
If I failed you
I tell you right now
All I want you to know, I love you
All I need is the time to show you
Come back, my fallen son
Don't let them fool you
'Cause when the day is done
They never move you
Lay down your sense of pride
(Got more than you)
Put out your mournful tones
I tell you right now
All I want you to know, I love you
All I need is the time to show you how I feel
Feel
Lay down your sense of pride
Traveled once too often
I tell you right now
All I want you to know, I love you
All I need is the time to show you, oh yeah
You know, I love you
All I need is the time to show you how I feel
