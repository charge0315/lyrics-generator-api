I used to be a rollin' stone, ya know
If a cause was right
I'd leave to find the answer on the road
I used to be a heart beatin' for someone
But the times have changed
The less I say, the more my work gets done

'Cause I live and breathe this Philadelphia freedom
From the day that I was born, I've waved the flag
Philadelphia freedom took me knee-high to a man, yeah
Gave me peace of mind my daddy never had

Oh, Philadelphia freedom, shine on me, an' I love ya
Shine the light through the eyes of the ones left behind
Shine the light, shine the light
Shine the light, won't you shine the light?
Philadelphia freedom, I love ya
Yes, I do

If you choose to, you can live your life alone
Some people choose the city (Some people choose the city)
Some others choose the good old family home
(Some others choose the good old family home)
I like livin' easy without family ties ('Livin easy)
'Til the whippoorwill of freedom zapped me
Right between the eyes

'Cause I live and breathe this Philadelphia freedom
From the day that I was born, I've waved the flag
Philadelphia freedom took me knee-high to a man, mm-hmm
Gave me peace of mind my daddy never had

Oh, Philadelphia freedom, shine on me, I love ya
Shine the light through the eyes of the ones left behind
Shine the light, shine the light
Shine the light, won't you shine the light?
Philadelphia freedom, I love ya
Yes, I do

Oh, Philadelphia freedom, shine on me, an' I love ya
Shine the light through the eyes of the ones left behind
Shine the light, shine the light
Shine the light, won't you shine the light?
Philadelphia freedom, I love
Don't you know I love, yeah?
Don't you know I love you?

Yes, I do! (Philadelphia freedom) I love you
(Yes, I do! Philadelphia freedom) You know that I love you
(Yes, I do! Philadelphia freedom) Don't you know that I love you?
(Yes, I do! Philadelphia freedom) Don't you know that I love you?
(Yes, I do! Philadelphia freedom) Don't you know that I love you?
(Yes, I do! Philadelphia freedom) Don't you know that I love you?
(Yes, I do...)
