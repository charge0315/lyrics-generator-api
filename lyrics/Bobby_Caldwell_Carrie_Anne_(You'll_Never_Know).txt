Carrie Anne
I see you each night
A beckoning silhouette from your bedroom light
Carrie Anne
I know it sounds strange
But I had to ask around and find out your name

Only voyeurs will peer through a window
And that's not like me
I can't help but see

Carrie Anne
You'll never know how I've made love to you
Maybe a thousand times
If just in my mind
If that's a sin I'll repent when life's through
For now I'll enjoy the view
Carrie Anne

I fantasize
That you can see me
And that in a twisted kind of way you want to be seen
Carrie Anne
I see you just fine
Your curtains are open and I'd havе to be blind

Only voyeurs will peer through a window
And that's not like mе
I can't help but see

Carrie Anne
You'll never know how I've made love to you
Maybe a thousand times
If just in my mind
If that's a sin I'll repent when life is through
For now I'll enjoy the view
Carrie Anne
