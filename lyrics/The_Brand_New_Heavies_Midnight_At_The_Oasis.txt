Midnight at the oasis

Midnight at the oasis
Send your camel to bed
Shadows painting our faces
Traces of romance in our heads
Heaven's holding a half moon
Shining just for us
Let's slip off to a sand dune real soon
Kick up a little dust

Come out, cactus is our friend
He'll point out the way
Come out 'til the evening ends
'Til the evening ends

You don't have to answer
There's no need to speak
I'll be your belly dancer
Prancer and you could be my sheik
But you won't need no harem, honey
When I am by your side
And you won't need no camel
No, no, when I take you for a ride

Come out, cactus is our friend
He'll point out the way
Come out 'til the evening ends
'Til the evening ends

Midnight at the oasis
Send your camel to bed
Let's slip off to a sand dune real soon
Kick up a little dust

Come out, cactus is our friend
He'll point out the way
Come out 'til the evening ends
'Til the evening ends
Come out, cactus is our friend
He'll point out the way
Come out 'til the evening ends
'Til the evening ends, ow

Oasis (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Midnight (Oasis) at the oasis
Midnight at the oasis
Midnight at the oasis
