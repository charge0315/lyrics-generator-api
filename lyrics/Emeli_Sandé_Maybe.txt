When we first moved in together
Couldn't keep hands off each other
Now we're lying back to back, and silence in the black
We used to laugh until we cried
You used to look at me and smile
Now we hardly say hello, and feelings never show

And all the signs seem to say love is lost
But I don't wanna give up what we've got

Maybe you could stay a bit longer
I could try and bit harder
We could make this work
But maybe we should stop pretending
We both know we're hurting
Maybe it's time to go

We broke up last Sunday night
Keep on thinking 'bout the fight
Rest my head against the wall
Your bags are by the door
Then your key turns in the lock
You see me on the stairs and stop
Have you had a change of heart?
Can we go back to the start?

But all the signs seem to say love is lost
But I don't wanna give up yet because

Maybe you could stay a bit longer
I could try and bit harder
We could make this work
But maybe we should stop pretending
We both know we're hurting
Maybe it's time to go

Maybe it's time to go, maybe it's time to go
Maybe it's time to go
We can make it work, we can make it work

Maybe you could stay a bit longer
I could try and bit harder
We could make this work
But maybe we should stop pretending
Both of us are hurting
Maybe it's time to go
Maybe it's time to go

Maybe we could make this work
Maybe it's time to go
Maybe we could make this work
Maybe it's time to go
