You got your hopes up for a reason
Now's the time to decide
Don't you wait another season
Get your sights up right before your changes pass you by
Time goes on, the world keeps turning
Make your move, aim for the top
You make a difference, keep learning
Put your best foot forward, you can make this kind of rock
Refrain:
You've got to strive, go for what you know
Strive, don't give up on your dreams
You've got to strive
And let the world know you're really alive
You've got to strive, go for what you know
Strive, don't give up on your dreams
You've got to strive
Let the world know you're really alive
You know the score, you know what's happening
And don't feel sorry for yourself
Roll up your sleeves, let's get to crackin'
Shut your doubts up in the closet, leave your pity on the shelf
Keep your nose onto the grindstone
Faith in God will pull you through
Load up your gun, get off your hindbone
Fire at the target, hit the mark, oh why don't you?
Refrain
