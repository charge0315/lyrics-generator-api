{Intro}
(Any day)
(Woah-oh-oh, woah)
(Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)

Another day, another life
I wanna live it to the fullest
A little work, a lotta play, alright
No time to give, no time to take away
So here we go again with my mistakes

We'll never be as young as we are now

You say it's alright, you say it's okay
It's up to you, is that the truth? Tell me
I'm feelin' used with no one to save me
You say it's alright, does that make it o-okay?
What's best for you is less for me
It's my decision

(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)

I wanna be all that I can be
I want to see the light and to live for me
So I, I'm gonna seize the day
Plеase don't forget my name, oh!

Wе'll never be as young as we are now

You say it's alright, you say it's okay
It's up to you, is that the truth? Tell me
I'm feelin' used with no one to save me
You say it's alright, does that make it o-okay?
What's best for you is less for me
It's my decision (Woo)

(Woo)
Oh
(Woo-ooh)

Never, never, never, never again
It's my life, my life, my life, my life to live
Da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da, da, da

You say it's alright, you say it's okay
It's up to you, is that the truth? Tell me
I'm feelin' used with no one to save me
You say it's alright, does that make it o-okay?
What's best for them, not listening
It's my decision
You say it's alright, you say it's okay
It's up to you, is that the truth? Tell me (Oh)
I'm feelin' used with no one to save me

(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
No one to save me
