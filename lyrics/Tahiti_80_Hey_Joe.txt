There are so many things to say about Joe
First why did we let him go
A star of second-hand record markets
Sweet eyes with a bow tie and it's done
Hey Joe!How can we know
What you've been doing all these years?
It's not that I'm asking you for money
I just want you by my side
His brother Marc and his cousin Bob
They were both chased by huge mobs
While Joe he could only sing about the things
Crazy women didn't bring
Hey Joe! How can we know
What you've been doing all these years?
It's not that I'm asking you for money
I just want you by my side
Write a song Sing along
That's all we can do (sing a song)
That's all we can do (to hear from you)
That's all we can do
Hey Joe! How can we know
What you've been doing all these years?
It's not that I'm asking you for money
I just want you by my side
Hey Joe, hey Joe Dolan!
