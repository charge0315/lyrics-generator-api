On the street where you live
Girls talk about their social lives
They're made of lipstick, plastic, and paint
A touch of sable in their eyes
(All your life) All your life all you've asked
When's your daddy gonna talk to you?
But you were livin' in another world
Tryna get a message through

No one heard a single word you said
They shoulda seen it in your eyes
What was goin' 'round your head (Ooh-ooh)

Ooh, she's a little runaway
Daddy's girl learned fast
All those things she couldn't say
Ooh, she's a little runaway

Take a line every night, guaranteed to blow your mind
I see you out on the streets, callin' for a wild time
So you sit home alone, 'cause there's nothin' left that you can do
There's only pictures hung in the shadows left there to look at you

You know she likes the lights at night on the neon Broadway sign
She don't really mind, it's only love she hoped to find (Ooh-ooh)

Ooh, she's a little runaway
Daddy's girl learned fast
All those things she couldn't say
Ooh, she's a little runaway

No one heard a single word you said
They should've have seen it in your eyes (Seen it in your eyes)
What was going 'round your head

Ooh, she's a little runaway
Daddy's girl learned fast
All those things she couldn't say
Ooh, she's a little runaway
Daddy's girl learned fast
Now she works the night away

Oh, she's a little runaway
Run, run, run, run, run, a little runaway
(Daddy's girl learned fast all those things he couldn't say)
Ooh, she's a little runaway
Run, run, run, run, run, little runaway
(Daddy's girl learned fast, now she works the night away)
