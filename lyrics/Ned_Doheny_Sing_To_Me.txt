Ooh
Sing to me, I long to hear
That old familiar song
The one that starts so sweet and sad
And lingers for so long
Let me be in love again
There's no place left to go
Nothing I can't say to you
You don't already know
Ah, but you can sing to me
Sing to me, my love
Sing to me, babe
Sing to me, my love
Walk me down through twisted streets
With tales there to tell
Of strangers that you left behind
Of rooms that knew you well
Bring to me the memory of
The rapture and the pain
The battles that you fought and won
The love you lost in vain
Thе chain is unbroken
As it stretches out to sеa
The word is unspoken
You have only to believe
Sing to me
Sing to me, my love
Sing to me
Sing to me, my love
How can I get close to you?
How can I get close to you?
How can I get close to you?
How can I get close to you?
Sing to me, babe
Sing to me, babe
Sing to me, babe
Sing to me, babe
Sing to me, babe
Sing to me, babe
Sing to me, babe
How can I get close to you?
How can I get close to you?
