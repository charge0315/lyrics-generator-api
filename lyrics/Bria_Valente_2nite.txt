Ooh
Tonight
Disco, disco dance
Ooh

Happy people in the disco light
Dancin' sexy 'cause the music's right
Put your arm around me and hold me tight
There's no tomorrow there's just tonight
Tonight
(Ooh)
(Disco, disco dance)

Worked so hard all through the week
I just wanna get off my feet
Hit me back at a quarter to nine
We can jam and have a real good time
Tonight
Ooh
('You wanna jam with me?')
(Higher, lover)

No guns or drugs up in the place
Old school jams put a smile on your face tonight
Do it, baby, do it

No Top 40, no none of that junk
I know this dope spot that just plays funk
You know this jam is sure to move the crowd
Everybody's dancing, no posing allowed
Tonight, ooh
Tonight, ooh
Disco, disco dance with me, baby

Note to self: must avoid
Brokeback bustas unemployed
Brothers who call me shorty in the pickup line
And all those who only got one thing on their mind

Happy people in the disco light
Dancin' sexy 'cause the music's right
Put your arm around me and hold me tight
There's no tomorrow there's just 2night
Tonight, ooh
Tonight, ooh
(Disco, disco dance, baby)

Belinda, Bianca, me, and you
We can party like grown folks do
Come correct and I give you a chance
Don't ask me for my number, just ask me to dance
Tonight, ooh
Tonight, ooh
Tonight, ooh
Tonight, ooh

Shake your flipside and feel the beat
Wake up the next day in the Palazzo suites
Lay out 'til noon in the desert sun
Don't get mad 'cause we havin' fun
If we gonna party, let's party right
No yesterday just remember tonight
2night, ooh
Higher, lover
Go higher, lover
Ooh
