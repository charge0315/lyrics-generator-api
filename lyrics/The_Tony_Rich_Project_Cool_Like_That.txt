I really don't wanna fight
I just wanna tell you that I love you
It's worth more love to me
That I treat you like a lady
After all we've been through
When you think it's cool like that
You can just believe it'll get better
Even though we'll fight sometime
Just know it could be a hell of a lot worse
After all we've been through
Remember we had it out
That night I said that I would leave you
But baby, I'd be a fool
When I know damn well
I can't live without you
After all we've been through
When you think it's cool like that
You can just believe it'll get better
Even though we'll fight sometime
Just know it could be a hell of a lot worse
After all we've been through
I know I shouldn't have took you
Through so much pain
And I know that our love still remains
In your heart, I see that you love me, babe
In spite of all I do, you know that I love you
When you think it's cool like that
You can just believe it'll get better
Even though we'll fight sometime
Just know it could be a hell of a lot worse
After all we've been through
When you think it's cool like that
You can just believe it'll get better
Even though we'll fight sometime
Just know it could be a hell of a lot worse
After all we've been through
