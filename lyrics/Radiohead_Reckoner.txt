You can't take it with you
Dancing for your pleasure

You are not to blame for
Bittersweet distractor
Dare not speak its name
Dedicated to all hu–
All human beings

Because we separate like ripples on a blank shore
(In rainbows)
Because we separate like ripples on a blank shore
(In rainbows)

Take me with you
Dedicated to all hu–
All human beings
