Please give me peace of mind
Ooh, ooh, say you'll be mine, come rain or shine

And when I kiss you, just say I do now
Oh, just say I do, do, do love you, oh baby

You're as sweet as old cherry wine
Ooh, ooh, like an angel, oh baby, you're so fine

Say you'll be with me my whole life through now
Oh, just say I do, do, do love you, oh baby

There are many ways of saying I love you (I love you)
But any word from you is good enough for me
To many hearts, love has been blinding
And if mine is one, if mine is one
It wants to be, it wants to be, oh baby, oh baby
Ooh, ooh, baby, oh baby

Each night of my dream
Ooh, ooh, I'm a king, my darling, you're my queen

And when I awake, please make my dream come true
Oh, just say now I do, do, do love you (Yeah)

I do, do, do love you (I love you, baby, ooh)
I do, do, do love you (Yeah, baby, love you, baby, need you, baby)
I do, do, do love you (Oh baby)
