Ace to Queen
And it's dust to dust
Things ain't changing
But I know I must
I've been hurtin'
Life seemed easy, no return
Took safety measures
But I still got burnt
I've been hurtin', all I need is you
How the hell did I lose you?
Head's not right
Much too loose
It's not screwed on tight
I've been hurtin', all I need is you
How the hell did I lose you?
My head's not right
How the hell did I lose you?
It's not screwed on tight
How the hell did I lose you?
I've been hurtin', all I need is you
Hanging out
Head to dry
I've been hurtin'
You made me cry
Well, I've been hurtin', all I need is you
I don't get worried
I keep a lid on tight
But it's hard to take, babe
I take it every night
I've been hurtin' and all I need is you
How the hell did I lose you?
My head's not right
How the hell did I lose you?
It's not screwed on tight, baby
How the hell did I lose you?
I've been hurtin', all I need is you
Got a head for money
You had a head for sin
Gonna build that space ship
We were gonna fly it in
I've been hurtin' and all I need is you
How the hell did I lose you?
How the hell did I lose you?
You know that, that my head's not right
How the hell did I lose you?
It's much too loose, it's not screwed on tight
How the hell did I lose you?
I've been hurtin' 'cos all I need is you
Tears for days
Ace to Queen
Dust to dust
Things ain't changing
Hanging out
Head's not right
Head to dry
And I've been hurtin'
Tears for days
Ace to Queen
Dust to dust
Things ain't changing
Hanging out
Head's not right
Head to dry
I've been hurtin'
Tears for days
Ace to Queen
Dust to dust
Things ain't changing
Hanging out
Head's not right
Head to dry
I've been hurtin'
