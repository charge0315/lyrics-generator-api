It was long, too long ago
Since love had touched my heart
And then there was this man
This nice and gentle man
In his eyes was paradise
I fell right from the start
So was all aflame
Before I knew his name
Chorus:
I
Was
Lucifer's lover
I believe he came from heaven
Now I know forever why love is blind
I
Was
Lucifer's lover
I am not ashamed I loved him
He will be forever on my mind
On my mind, on my mind
Now I know why love is blind
On my mind, on my mind
Now I know why love is blind
Yesterday he went away
He gave me one more kiss
He said: "I have to go
Where to I guess you know"
Then I cried, I even tried
To come along with him
He said: "That's not a place
For you, my angel face"
Chorus:
