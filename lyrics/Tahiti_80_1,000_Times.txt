Just because you'll always be miles ahead of me
I don't see why I shouldn't try to catch up with you
'Cause in my mind, a 1,000 times or more, I've been there before
There's nothing I can see that will stop me, believe me

Our time will come, and I don't think I will let
Another chance pass me by
Our time will come, and I don't think I will let
Another chance pass me by

No, I don't want you to get bored, like you have a 1,000 times before
Give me some time, just to show that I am up to it

Our time will come, and I don't think I will let
Another chance pass me by
Our time will come, and I don't think I will let
Another chance pass me by

There's something that can be done
To bring us back together as one
There's something else I can do
That's why I'm sending this message to you

I will try another 1,000 times to bring us back together as one
I will try another 1,000 times, till you decide to change your mind
I will try another 1,000 times to bring us back together as one
I will try another 1,000 times, till you decide to change your mind
I will try another 1,000 times to bring us back together as one
I will try another 1,000 times, till you decide to change your mind
