So high when I'm away from you
You got me like a I O U
So high when I'm away from you
I wanna be around you
I wake up in the morning
Everyday
And I think of you laying by my side
Would you ever be my bride? And then I
Smoke a thing just to calm myself
(Feelings)
Put them back while I'm at shove
Let them sit there for a while
Collect dust just around before I see you smile
And I'm goin' out of bed to make a cup of tea
Maybe hum a little melody like, hmm, yeah
I take a sip and I walk upstairs
My true thoughts got me unaware
It's 'cuz I'm hurting from not seeing you
While you sing this song when I'm feeling blue It's...
So high when I'm away from you
I need your love like a I O U
So high when I'm away from you
I wanna be around you, baby
That's so high when I'm away from you
I need love like a I O U
So high when I'm away from you
I wanna be around you, baby
Slowly I move away
From my true love and I am set
Now I am feeling down again
Like a long roll without an end
'Cuz I know that I'll fit in your shoe
Like a kiss with a view and a honey chew
Then I take a minute to comprehend
I got a letter that I need to send
And you know it is handed to you
With a post box from the inter city gloom It's...
So high when I'm away from you
I need your love like a I O U
So high when I'm away from you
I wanna be around you, baby
That's so high when I'm away from you
I need your love like a I O U
So high when I'm away from you
I wanna be around you, baby
