Your face looked new against the town
You've come to lose some memories
Like you, I came to touch new grounds

But you want to lose
The weight of the wind (of the wind)
Rests hard on your shoulders (so hard)
Bringing you down (down, down)
The one that you love (your love)
Will never be found!

You speak into the falling rain
Words you lost, but found again
I see their snaky arms entwined
So clear and cruel in your jealous mind

But you've got to lose
The weight of the wind (of the wind)
Rests hard on your shoulders (so hard)
I know what that means (down, down)
The one that you love (your love)
Will never be found!

The weight of the wind
The weight of the wind (of the wind)
Hard on your shoulders (so hard)
Driving you down (down, down)
The one that you love (your love)
Will never be found (found, oh...)
You lost her forever (you lost her forever)
Down, down
The weight of the wind
The weight of the wind  (ah, ah...)
Hard on your shoulders
Driving you down (ah, ah...)
The one that you love
Will never be found  (ah, ah...)
You lost her forever  (ah, ah...)
Down, down
