You are not alone
I am here with you
Even when you're scared
I'll never leave you
Standing in a storm
Making it insane once again
I will try to enchain you
But you open your eyes to the sky
And whisper
That you are so lonely
You are so alone
You're so alone
You're so lonely, so lonely
So I'm coloring my face
While I am here with you
Imagining the landscapes of your sorrow
Is it yellow or blue?
Coloring the sky, and the trees
And the clouds, and the moonlight
I'd color your heart
If you didn't, I did
Now you are so lonely
You are so alone
You're so alone
You're so lonely, so lonely
You are so alone
You're so
You're so lonely, so lonely
And I wish you could just find home
