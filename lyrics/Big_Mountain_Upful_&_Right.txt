Who feels it knows it
Who feels it knows it
Please open the valleys of trying to hide
Remember the fortunes of life forward sitting inside
Suffering the pace to visit the tranquil bees
Hush up the race, uncover what's underneath
Don't worry, don't worry
Don't worry, don't you worry
'Cause God's on your side
And you're healthy and bright
Don't worry, don't worry
Don't worry, don't you worry
'Cause God's on your side
And you're healthy and bright
Please unleash the child that's dying to cry
The centuries of unexplained sorrows, they're suffering the lies
Hush up the age with crise of sincerity
Turning the page proclaiming your unity
Don't worry, don't worry
Don't worry, don't you worry
'Cause God's on your side
And you're healthy and bright
Don't worry, don't worry
Don't worry, don't you worry
'Cause God's on your side
And you're healthy and bright
Don't worry, don't worry
Don't worry, don't you worry
'Cause God's on your side
And you're healthy and bright
Don't worry, don't worry
Don't worry, don't you worry
'Cause God's on your side
And you're healthy and bright
And you're upful and right
