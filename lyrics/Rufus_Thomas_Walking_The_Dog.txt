Mary Mack, dressed in black
Silver buttons all down her back
High to low, tip to toe
She broke a needle and she can't sew

Walkin' the dog
Just a-walkin' the dog
If you don't know how to do it
I'll show you how to walk the dog
C'mon now, c'mon, c'mon

Asked my mama for fifteen cent
See the elephant jump the fence
He jumped so high, he touched the sky
Never got back 'til the Fourth of July

Walkin' the dog
Just a-walkin' the dog
If you don't know how to do it
I'll show you how to walk the dog
C'mon now, c'mon, c'mon

Mary, Mary, quite contrary
Tell me, how does your garden grow?
You got silver bells and you got cockle shells
Pretty maids all in a row

Walkin' the dog
Just a-walkin' the dog
If you don't know how to do it
Show you how to walk the dog
C'mon now, c'mon, c'mon

Oh, oh
Just-a, just-a, just a-walkin'
Just-a, just-a, just a-walkin'
Just-a, just-a, just a-walkin'
Oh yeah
If you don't know how to do it
I'll show you how to walk the dog
Oh
Just-a, just-a, just-a, just-a, just-a, just a-walkin'
Just-a, just-a, just-a, just-a, just-a, just-a, just a-walkin'
Oh, oh, whoa
Just-a, just-a, just a-walkin'
