Oh, you sure
You sure have got me, girl

At last I'm past the fantasy
You're into my reality, oh yes, you are
More than just the love talkin'
Hey girl, we've got it workin', workin', workin'

Never had a love like this before (No, no, never)
Oh, I never had a love like this before (Never had a love like this before)
Never, never, never had a love like this before (Hey, baby)
Oh, I never had a love (Never had a love)

I'm so glad that I was patient
Lord sent me a heavenly creation, oh yes, He did
You're all I needed, needed, yeah
Oh, but it's all I conceded

Never had a love like this before (I never had a love like this before)
Oh, I never had a love like this before (She treats me so good)
Never, never, never had a love like this before (Hey, baby, you understand what I mean?)
Oh, I never had a love (Never)

Love's in your tender touch
'Cause everyday askin' for too much
Oh, I'm in love with what you doin'
Never get tired of a-watchin' you

Never had a love like this before (Never, never had a)
Oh, I never had a love like this before (Hey, girl, you're what I needed)
Never, never, never had a love like this before (Ooh I never, never, never)
Oh, I never had a love (Never, never had a love)

I've been in a lot of situations
But never like this before, oh no
There's been so much, so much anticipation
True love's that for sure, and everybody needs it
Everybody's lookin' for a good situation
Uptown, downtown, all around the world (Lookin' for the right girl)
Hopin' and prayin', oh, some never find it
The right boy or the right girl (Looking for the right boy, looking for the right girl)
And you hear what the fellas are sayin' (Never, never ever, ever, ever)
Never had a love like this before
Never, never, no, no
Ooh-ooh-ooh (Never, never ever, ever, ever)
Ever had a love like this before
Do you hear what fellas are sayin'? (Yeah)

Never had a love like this before (Ooh, I never had a love)
Oh, I never had a love like this before (Like this before)
Never, never, never had a love like this before (Yeah, I'm so happy with it)
Oh, I never had a love (Never had a love)
Never had a love like this before (Ooh, I've never been so sure)
Oh, I never had a love like this before (Oh, you got me feelin' so secure)
Never, never, never had a love like this before (Oh, I never, ever had a love)
Oh, I never had a love (Never had a love)

Never had a love like this before (Ooh, yeah, yeah)
Oh, I never had a love like this before (Ooh, yes sir)
Never, never, never had a love like this before (Ooh, I never, never, never)
Oh, I never had a love (Never had a love, love, love)
